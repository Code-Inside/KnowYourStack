All globs should work the same between `src` and `watch` now!\n-   Removed support for ordered globs. This aligns with the chokidar globbing implementation. If you need your globs to be ordered, you can use `ordered-read-stream`\n-   All globs and paths are normalized to unix-like filepaths\n-   Only allow JS variants for `.gulp.*` config files\n-   Removed support for alpha releases of v4 from `gulp-cli`\n-   Removed the `--verify` flag\n-   Renamed the `--require` flag to `--preload` to avoid conflicting with Node.js flags\n-   Removed many legacy and deprecated loaders\n-   Upgrade to chokidar v3\n-   Clone `Vinyl` objects with stream contents using `teex`, but no longer wait for all streams to flow before cloned streams will receive data\n-   Stop using `process.umask()` to make directories, instead falling back to Node's default mode\n-   Throw on non-function, non-string option coercers\n-   Drop support of Node.js snake_case flags\n-   Use a Symbol for attaching the `gulplog` namespace to the store\n-   Use a Symbol for attaching the `gulplog` store to the global\n-   Use sha256 to hash the `v8flags` cache into a filename\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Streamlined the dependency tree\n-   Switch all streams implementation to Streamx\n-   Rewrote `glob-stream` to use a custom directory walk that relies on newer Node.js features and is more performant than old implementation\n-   Implement translation support for all CLI messages and all messages passing through gulplog\n-   Allow users to customize or remove the timestamp from their logs\n-   Upgraded gulplog to v2. Messages logged via v1 will also display a deprecated warning. Plugins should update to v2 as the community upgrades to gulp 5\n-   Added support for `gulpile.cjs` and `gulpfile.mjs`\n-   Add support for `swc`, `esbuild`, `sucrase`, and `mdx` loaders\n-   Provide an ESM export ([#&#8203;2760](https://www.togithub.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2760)) ([b00de68](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/b00de681f5ef6ade283d544f62f770f6b27a9e52))\n-   Support sourcemap handling on streaming `Vinyl` contents\n-   Support `extends` syntax for `.gulp.*` config file\n-   Allow overriding `gulpfile` and `preloads` via `.gulp.*` config file\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Resolve bugs related to symlinks on various platforms\n-   Resolved some reported ReDoS CVEs and improved performance in glob-parent\n-   Rework errors surfaced when encountering files or symlinks when trying to create directories\n-   Ensure watch allows japanese characters in globs ([72668c6](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/72668c61e445c81fad23bc6ed24967a3238a648d))\n-   Ensure watch does not trigger on negated globs ([72668c6](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/72668c61e445c81fad23bc6ed24967a3238a648d))\n-   Improve handling of BOM at the beginning of a stream\n-   Properly handle function coercer in array of option coercers\n-   Fork `to-absolute-glob` to:\n    -   Check negative patterns before trimming\n    -   Ensure glob-like characters are escaped in cwd & root options\n    -   Resolve `../` at the beginning of globs\n\n##### Miscellaneous Chores\n\n-   Remove lazystream dependency\n-   Updated various stream test suites to test against Node.js core `stream`, `readable-stream`, and `streamx`\n-   Normalize repository, dropping node <10.13 support ([#&#8203;2758](https://www.togithub.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2758)) ([72668c6](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/72668c61e445c81fad23bc6ed24967a3238a648d))\n\n##### Individual Changelogs\n\nWe created and maintain various projects that gulp depends upon.

Previously, Angular change detection\r\nwas soley based on the state of the Angular Zone.\r\n\r\n## commit 2\r\n[fix(core): Angular should not ignore changes that happen outside the zone](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/24d8feb17779408b31bb6401a809eb470bdf6b4e) \r\n\r\nWhen Angular receives a clear indication that change detection should\r\nrun again, this should not be ignored, regardless of what Zone it\r\nhappened in. This change updates the default change detection scheduling\r\napproach of Zone-based applications to ensure a change detection will\r\nrun when these events happen outside the Angular zone (which includes,\r\nfor example, updating a signal that's read in a template, setting an\r\ninput of a `ComponentRef`, attaching a view marked for check, calling\r\n`ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck`, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis does not apply to applications using `NoopNgZone` or those which\r\nhave a custom `NgZone` implementation without ZoneJS.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this change will most often be seen in existing unit tests. Tests\r\nexecute outside the Angular Zone and this can mean that state in the\r\ntest is not fully recognized by Angular. Now that Angular will ensure\r\nchange detection _does_ run, even when the state update originates from\r\noutside the zone, tests may observe additional rounds of change\r\ndetection compared to the previous behavior. Often, this should be seen\r\nas more correct and the test should be updated, but in cases where it is\r\ntoo much effort to debug, the test can revert to the old behavior by adding\r\n`provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\r\nto the `TestBed` providers.\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53844\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n\r\nAngular will ensure change detection runs, even when the state update originates from\r\noutside the zone, tests may observe additional rounds of change\r\ndetection compared to the previous behavior.\r\n\r\nThis change will be more likely to impact existing unit tests.\r\nThis should usually be seen as more correct and the test should be updated,\r\nbut in cases where it is too much effort to debug, the test can revert to the old behavior by adding\r\n`provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\r\nto the `TestBed` providers.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, applications which may want to update state outside the zone\r\nand _not_ trigger change detection can add\r\n`provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\r\nto the providers in `bootstrapApplication` or add\r\n`schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly` to the\r\n`BootstrapOptions` of `bootstrapModule`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55102","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add zoneless scheduler to Angular by default\" (#55102)"},{"Id":"2214052165","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T20:54:18","Actor":"atscott","Number":"55101","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): re-export private exports from testing","State":"closed","Body":"This commit re-exports private exports  from testing package.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55101","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): re-export private exports from testing\" (#55101)"},{"Id":"2214039072","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T20:15:06","Actor":"atscott","Number":"55100","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Privately export SchedulingMode enum","State":"closed","Body":"Expose enum for early testers so they don't have to awkwardly put `0` for Hybrid mode.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55100","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): Privately export SchedulingMode enum\" (#55100)"},{"Id":"2213834588","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T20:14:30","Actor":"atscott","Number":"55098","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): private export token to disable `fixture.detectChanges` error","State":"closed","Body":"While we do want to discourage `fixture.detectChanges`, it is yet to be determined how this should be accomplished (warning, documentation, etc.).

Clone https://github.com/BouckaertThibault/angular-17-mapbox-csp (a dummy access token is already provided)\r\n2. npm install\r\n3. ng serve --prebundle=false\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nERROR TypeError: ug.workerClass is not a constructor\r\n    at new hg (mapbox-gl-csp.js:3:304799)\r\n    at WorkerPool.acquire (mapbox-gl-csp.js:3:305062)\r\n    at new Dispatcher (mapbox-gl-csp.js:3:284920)\r\n    at new Style (mapbox-gl-csp.js:3:693886)\r\n    at Map._updateStyle (mapbox-gl-csp.js:3:828788)\r\n    at Map.setStyle (mapbox-gl-csp.js:3:828538)\r\n    at new Map (mapbox-gl-csp.js:3:818918)\r\n    at _AppComponent.<anonymous> (app.component.ts:22:16)\r\n    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)\r\n    at main.js:72:61\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.2\r\nNode: 20.10.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.2\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Cannot import mapbox worker with application builder\" (#27378)"},{"Id":"2212918751","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T10:54:04","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"27377","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): use eventCoalescing option by default (standalone bootstrap)","State":"open","Body":"This commit enables eventCoalescing by default for standalone applications.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27377","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): use eventCoalescing option by default (standalone bootstrap)\" (#27377)"},{"Id":"2211252805","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T16:29:15","Actor":"Tenessy","Number":"27374","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 17 prerender performance mark has not been set","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild, serve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAn issue is present when I use \"**enablePerformanceProfiler**\"  with **new commonEngine** in server.ts file to show the SSR performance with an application build in **prerender SSG**.\r\n\r\nThis error show when I have routes not prerender and just SSR version of my page.

I want to deploy an angular ssr app under a subpath of a domain, for example https://example.org/myapp. This subpath is handled by an nginx reverse proxy. So far so good.\r\n\r\nNow I'm adding baseHref to the angular.json. It gets added to the index.html, everything fine. But if I'm looking to the `server.ts` I see the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver.get('*.*', express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n        maxAge: '1y',\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nserver.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n        commonEngine\r\n            .render({\r\n                bootstrap,\r\n                documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n                url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n                publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n                providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl }],\r\n            })\r\n            .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n            .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the baseUrl is always empty. Because the baseUrl can only be set if the code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst router = express.Router();\r\n\r\nrouter.get('*.*', express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n        maxAge: '1y',\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nrouter.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n        const { protocol, originalUrl, baseUrl, headers } = req;\r\n\r\n        commonEngine\r\n            .render({\r\n                bootstrap,\r\n                documentFilePath: indexHtml,\r\n                url: `${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}`,\r\n                publicPath: browserDistFolder,\r\n                providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: baseUrl }],\r\n            })\r\n            .then((html) => res.send(html))\r\n            .catch((err) => next(err));\r\n    });\r\n\r\nserver.use('/myapp', router);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout using .use() the baseUrl MUST be empty. So I don't understand the whole purpose behind the default code? And of course it's not working with the default code, otherwise I wouldn't write.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like this scenario is not possible without changing the server.ts fundamentally. And it would be nice, if this changes are described in the docs.\r\n\r\nOr if they were the default and changes to the baseHref option in the angular.json would also affect the server.ts. That I don't have to change the server.use() part manually.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 17.3.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27356","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 17 SSR baseHref / baseUrl is not respected\" (#27356)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2211948225","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T23:33:14","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28790","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/button-toggle): standard button toggle strong focus bord…","State":"closed","Body":"…er-radius","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28790","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/button-toggle): standard button toggle strong focus bord…\" (#28790)"},{"Id":"2214286846","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T22:46:59","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28799","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.3.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.3.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28799","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.3.2 release\" (#28799)"},{"Id":"2214284878","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T22:44:21","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28798","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.3.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28798","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.3.2\" with changelog.\" (#28798)"},{"Id":"2214206001","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T22:33:24","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28795","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-next.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"This PR cherry-picks the changelog for v18.0.0-next.2 into the main branch so that the changelog is up to date.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28795","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-next.2\" with changelog.\" (#28795)"},{"Id":"2214237735","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T22:05:02","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28797","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"release: cut the v18.0.0-next.2 release\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 01c8abf32d15708f9f97a4f93aea180a7f8a1ea3.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28797","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"release: cut the v18.0.0-next.2 release\"\" (#28797)"},{"Id":"2214209327","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T21:56:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28796","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: match Node version with main","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the required Node version in the patch branch to match the main branch.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28796","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: match Node version with main\" (#28796)"},{"Id":"2214199459","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T21:37:00","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28794","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-next.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28794","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-next.2\" with changelog.\" (#28794)"},{"Id":"2213846350","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T18:15:09","Actor":"ice-blaze","Number":"28793","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(chips): Tabindex is missing in the documentation","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nToday I struggled about mat-chips being focusable and wanted to make them unfocusable (but not disabled). I thought there was no `tabindex` until I found this comment which obiously said you can acces it through `[tabIndex]` https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20883#issuecomment-744759846.\r\n\r\nNow the first question: is it expected to have no mentions of the `tabIndex` in the documentation? Because there is already the `id` and `value` inputs for example and I believe the `tabIndex` could be there too. Also apprently I'm not the only one on the internet struggling knowing it exists. I think it could be a good addition to the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you think it makes totally sense 🎉I'm super motivated to update the repository to see them. I already checked in the source code that all these components have a tabindex input:\r\n* button\r\n* checkbox\r\n* chips\r\n* datepicker\r\n* expansion-panel\r\n* radio\r\n* select\r\n* slide-toggle\r\n* tab\r\n* tree\r\nI also have the feeling that the documentation uses the comments from [angular/component](https://github.com/angular/component) and is generated in [angular/material.angular.io](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io). So I have the feeling I only need to update angular/component. As far as I understand there is already comments above the `tabIndex` input so it should be visible in the documentation. \r\n\r\nIf angular/component seems OK I was wondering maybe in angular/material.angular.io there is some filtering that ignores `tabIndex` but no mentions at all about `tabIndex` so I have the feeling that our problem doesn't lay there.\r\n\r\nLast point, in the API Report File for \"components-srcs\" I can see some attributes with `// (undocumented)` comment above. These attributes aren't visible in the documentation. But still, the `tabIndex` don't have this kind of comment above.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to fix this problem myself but it would be nice if someone could give me some hints on where to look. It would save me some time :)\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttp://localhost:4200/components/chips/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): Tabindex is missing in the documentation\" (#28793)"},{"Id":"2213590003","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T16:01:06","Actor":"XavierDupessey","Number":"28792","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/drag-drop): DRAG AND DROP SELECTING TEXT WITH SHADOW DOM ENCAPSULATION ON FIREFOX","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with Drag and Drop examples from https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview when a parent component is encapsulated with Shadow DOM **on Firefox**: it selects text of other elements (cf video).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/assets/1449888/2273a28d-637c-4a55-bb85-bfcfed87119c\r\n\r\nI tested it with the \"Drag&Drop connected sorting\" example from version 14 to 17.\r\nThe bug exists in all versions (I did not try older versions).\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nXavier\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link (under v14): https://stackblitz.com/edit/gszzna?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-drag-drop-connected-sorting-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

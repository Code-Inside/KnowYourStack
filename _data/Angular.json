The correct implementation is:\n\n```html\n<div [style.width.px]=\"myWidth\"></div>\n\n<!-- OR -->\n\n<div [style.width]=\"`${myWidth}px`\"></div>\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAngular's behavior is probably correct and equivalent to `<div style=\"width: 500;\"></div>` which also has no effect and emits no error. It's CSS that's being unhelpful.\n\nHowever I think this is a good opportunity for an extended diagnostic, one which errors when binding a number into a CSS style and pointing users at `.px` bindings or template literals. This will help explicitly call out the users mistake and point them at the correct solution.\n\nThis would likely require some form of allowlist of common CSS properties which accept length values. We could probably start with `width` and `height`, being the most common, but there's potentially a long tail of other CSS properties which should arguably be included as well.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nOne related challenge is whether it is ever reasonable to bind a number directly to a CSS property, and if so, which ones should we allow/ban?\n\n`grid-column-start` is one example of a CSS property which is a unitless number, and binding that does work (binding to a string works as well).\n\n```html\n<div [style.grid-column-start]=\"2\"></div>\n\n<!-- OR: Bind to a string -->\n\n<div [style.grid-column-start]=\"'2'\"></div>\n```\n\nI imagine we'd rather avoid managing a list of CSS properties where this is valid, but under the hood, aren't all CSS properties eventually converted to strings? Maybe we should (via extended diagnostics or regular type checking) require that all CSS properties are converted to strings?\n\nThis doesn't actually help with the original \"forgot to add `px`\" problem, since erroring on `50` and requiring `'50'` would still do nothing and emit no error. So I think fundamentally we'd need to know which properties are sizes and expect units vs which do not.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61381","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Emit Error When Binding Numbers to non-Numeric CSS properies\" (#61381)"},{"Id":"3067356777","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T20:53:36","Actor":"atscott","Number":"61380","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(zone.js): Allow fakeAsync to be used outside of ProxyZone with warning","State":"open","Body":"As an alternative to monkey patching vitest, this change updates `fakeAsync` to allow uses outside of a `ProxyZone`.

This results in unnecessary redundancy and boilerplate when UI elements (such as shared buttons, headers, or layouts) are repeated across multiple components.\n\nDevelopers are often forced to use wrapper components or repeat common markup, which increases complexity and maintenance overhead.\n\n### Use Case\nSuppose you have multiple components that need to include the same \"Save\" and \"Cancel\" buttons. Currently, you must:\n\n- Manually add these buttons to every child component’s template.\n- Or wrap each component in a separate reusable component, which introduces another layer and forces you to create redurance component.\n\nInstead, with template inheritance, these buttons could be declared once in a abstract base class template, and child components would automatically be rendered within that base structure, similar to how class inheritance works in TypeScript.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a new Angular feature allowing template inheritance via an abstract component base class and a special projection tag (e.g., <ng-extend>).\n\nMechanics:\n\n1. Abstract Base Component: Defines a template with shared structure (e.g., layout, footer buttons).\n2. Child Component: Extends the base class and defines its specific content.\n3. Angular automatically wraps the child component’s template into the <ng-extend> slot within the base component’s template at render time.\n\nExample: \n\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-user-form',\n  template: `\n    <form>\n      <input placeholder=\"User Name\" />\n    </form>\n  `\n})\nexport class UserFormComponent extends BaseFormComponent {}\n```\n\n\n```\n@Component({\n  template: `\n    <div class=\"form-wrapper\">\n      <ng-extend></ng-extend>\n      <div class=\"actions\">\n        <button>Save</button>\n        <button>Cancel</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  `\n})\nexport abstract class BaseFormComponent {}\n```\n\nExpected Rendered Output when just using `<app-user-form/>`: \n\n```\n<div class=\"form-wrapper\">\n  <form>\n    <input placeholder=\"User Name\" />\n  </form>\n  <div class=\"actions\">\n    <button>Save</button>\n    <button>Cancel</button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1.

It has both a required validator, and a simple asynchronous validator. The field is initialized in the class constructor by calling form.patchValue() - see the reproduction link. As a result, the form enters PENDING state, a statusChanges value is emitted, and also a StatusChangeEvent. However, as soon as the asynchronous validator completes, there is no statusChanges value emitted, neither a StatusChangeEvent.\n\nWhat was expected:\nhaving a look at https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41519#issuecomment-2112947187, i think it is probably not expected that a VALID statusChanges value is emitted. However, it is expected that a StatusChangeEvent is emitted.\n\nWhat happened:\nNeither a VALID statusChanges value was emitted, nor a VALID StatusChangeEvent.\n\n### Please provide a link to a

They all live together in an Nx monorepository. It is the responsibility of one of these applications to handle user login. For ease of development, we have long configured each app and their proxies to handle forwarding to every other app, so that developers can start whichever apps are relevant to the work they are doing, log in using that app on its own port, and then navigate to other apps without needing to manually type a different port.\n\nI hope this makes sense, I can try to explain more clearly if it doesn't. The important part is that we nearly always have more than one app running, and no matter which app's dev-server port you are on, they will always be able to forward requests intended for apps other than themselves. To achieve this each app has a unique base path which the proxy configuration uses to determine where to send requests.\n\nWe recently switched from the `browser` builder to the new `application` builder, and as a consequence the `dev-server` now uses Vite rather than Webpack. On the whole this has all been a great, apart from one thing: hot module reloading is broken cross-app.\n\nI've created and linked a (somewhat minimal) reproduction repository below.\n\nWhile investigating this myself, I noticed that when an app tries to hot update while on the \"wrong\" port, the part that seems to fail is fetching the new JavaScript file. The WebSocket connects just fine, receives the `angular:component-update` event just fine, and makes the request for the updated file just fine. The request even succeeds, actually, but the response is empty. Some screenshots for explanation:\n\n<img width=\"1282\" alt=\"WebSocket connects\" title=\"WebSocket connects\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74259f69-c61a-4bb8-b462-3a8a6dbcd4c0\" />\n\n<img width=\"1281\" alt=\"WebSocket receives update event\" title=\"WebSocket receives update event\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/622cb771-fbac-4595-94e8-f742a4b6d267\" />\n\n<img alt=\"JavaScript response is empty\" title=\"JavaScript response is empty\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a86b6e36-fa04-48a4-ba12-3185d429d2fa\" />\n\nIt's worth noting that `full-reload` events work just fine, which is probably expected given the nature of what's failing about the hot reload.\n\nThat's as far as I've gotten. I'm not sure if there is some proxy configuration that I could do to fix this (I've tried some basic tweaks with no luck), or if this is a bug somewhere that needs to be fixed. But in the meantime, turning HMR off \"fixes\" things for us, though it isn't ideal of course.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you!\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/tmercswims/ng-vite-mono-hmr\n\nIncludes reproduction steps in README.\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.12\nNode: 22.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.11\n... common, core, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.12\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.12\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.12\n@angular/cli                    19.2.12\n@angular/compiler               19.2.11\n@angular/compiler-cli           19.2.11\n@schematics/angular             19.2.12\nrxjs                            7.8.2\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30321","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Running multiple applications which proxy to each other breaks HMR\" (#30321)"},{"Id":"3066733172","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T15:59:33","Actor":"LakshminadhSDx","Number":"30317","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular-devkit/build-angular@19.2.11 not published, causing install errors with @angular/cli@19.2.11","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I run ng new my-app, the process fails with the error:\nNo matching version found for @angular-devkit/build-angular@^19.2.11.\nI expected the Angular CLI to create a new project successfully.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nOpen terminal\nRun ng new my-app\nWait for dependencies to install\nSee the error\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nnpm ERR! code ETARGET\nnpm ERR! notarget No matching version found for @angular-devkit/build-angular@^19.2.11.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.11\nNode: 22.15.1\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: win32 x64\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI have not modified any configuration files.\nThis happens with a fresh install of Angular CLI.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9b8c315-3205-4552-8a64-e0dc7ef41664)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30317","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@angular-devkit/build-angular@19.2.11 not published, causing install errors with @angular/cli@19.2.11\" (#30317)"},{"Id":"3065413847","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T13:20:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30316","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove unused function","State":"closed","Body":"Remove unused code\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30316","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove unused function\" (#30316)"},{"Id":"3064924414","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T08:41:18","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30314","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency node to v22.15.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|\n| [node](https://nodejs.org) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node)) | patch | `22.15.0` -> `22.15.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/node (node)</summary>\n\n### [`v22.15.1`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.15.1): 2025-05-14, Version 22.15.1 &#x27;Jod&#x27; (LTS), @&#8203;RafaelGSS\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/compare/v22.15.0...v22.15.1)\n\nThis is a security release.\n\n##### Notable Changes\n\n-   (CVE-2025-23166) fix error handling on async crypto operation\n-   (CVE-2025-23165) add missing call to uv_fs_req_cleanup\n\n##### Commits\n\n-   \\[[`edaf54da00`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/edaf54da00)] - **fs**: added test for missing call to uv_fs_req_cleanup (Justin Nietzel) [#&#8203;57811](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57811)\n-   \\[[`9f403e98ef`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/9f403e98ef)] - **(CVE-2025-23165)** **fs**: add missing call to uv_fs_req_cleanup (Justin Nietzel) [#&#8203;57811](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57811)\n-   \\[[`f4494d38f1`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/f4494d38f1)] - **(CVE-2025-23166)** **src**: fix error handling on async crypto operations (RafaelGSS) [nodejs-private/node-private#709](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs-private/node-private/pull/709)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

As a result, importing SVGs in specs fails with:\n\n`No loader is configured for \".svg\" files`\n\n**Important:** with the normal build it works perfectly fine.\n\n### Expected Behavior:\n\nThe builderMode: \"application\" and accompanying loader map should be accepted by the test builder’s schema, enabling esbuild to inline or file‐emit .svg imports exactly as in the application build.\n\nSpecs importing SVGs should compile under the esbuild‐powered pipeline without further WebPack tweaks.\n\n[Docs to the implementation example](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration#file-extension-loader-customization)\n[Docs to the test build](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration#new-features)\n\n### Actual Behavior:\n\nThe CLI fails schema validation on angular.json with an error like:\n\n```\nSchema validation failed with the following errors:\n  Data path “/projects/phlu-webapp/architect/test/options” should NOT have additional properties(loader).\n```\nTests continue to use the WebPack‐based Karma builder (which knows nothing about esbuild loaders), so importing an SVG in a spec throws:\n\n`No loader is configured for \".svg\" files`\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n### Component to load the svg\n\n**svg-loader.component.ts**\n\n```\nimport { Component, Input, OnInit } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { DomSanitizer, SafeHtml } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"app-svg-loader\",\n  standalone: true,\n

Each time I need the cache disabled, I have to manually edit angular.json and later revert the change. It'd be great if I could avoid these steps.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nHaving a `--no-cache` option for `ng serve` would make this workflow much smoother. It would disable caching only for that specific run, leaving the global configuration untouched.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI can automate this process using the trap command in a shell script, but since trap doesn’t work on Windows, I’d need to maintain a custom script, which complicates things unnecessarily for this simple problem.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow disabling CLI cache in `ng serve` via command-line flag\" (#30308)"},{"Id":"3063261237","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-14T14:07:14","Actor":"igord","Number":"30306","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): respect i18nDuplicateTranslation …","State":"open","Body":"…option when duplicates exist\r\n\r\nRunning the extract-i18n command will always log duplicate i18n message IDs as warnings, regardless of the value of the i18nDuplicateTranslation option.

Some of the API requests have infrequently changing data. Pulling the response from cache would save a lot of network time, especially if the response is big.\n\nFlow: \nUser 1 makes makes request to Angular SSR server -> SSR makes requests to API in order to gather data for rendering -> request gets cached -> user 1 receives an html response.\nUser 2 makes request to Angular SSR server -> SSR server would make API request in order to gather data, but instead pulls the response from the cache -> user 2 receives an html response.\n\nOne possible implementation would be to consider Cache-Control header and cache the response in the server for the time specified.\n\nIf this will not be considered - what would you say is the best approach in order to optimize these kind of API requests? Perhaps a wrapper around `global.fetch` in Node server (where Angular engine runs) which would monitor every API request and store in some local cache?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30305","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 19 SSR/hybrid rendering engine: cross-request cache\" (#30305)"},{"Id":"3061821911","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-14T13:29:42","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30301","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency terser to v5.39.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.39.0` -> `5.39.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.39.0/5.39.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.39.1`](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5391)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.39.0...v5.39.1)\n\n-   Fix bitwise operations that could mix `BigInt` and `number`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

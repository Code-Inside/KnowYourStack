If applications then perform *relative* SSR `HttpClient` calls during render, those calls can be resolved against an attacker-influenced origin if the deployment trusts unvalidated header values.\n\nThis issue requests documentation / scaffolding changes so apps do not inherit an unsafe default.\n\n### Why this matters\n`Host` and `X-Forwarded-*` headers are not inherently trustworthy inputs. When used to construct a base URL for SSR routing and request resolution, they can steer server-side outbound requests in apps that do relative data fetching during SSR.\n\n### Code references (in-repo)\n- `angular/integration/platform-server/projects/ngmodule/server.ts`:\n  - Constructs `url: \\`${protocol}://${headers.host}${originalUrl}\\``\n- `angular/packages/platform-server/src/location.ts`:\n  - `ServerPlatformLocation` consumes `INITIAL_CONFIG.url` and populates `protocol/hostname/port/...` from it.\n- `angular/packages/platform-server/src/http.ts`:\n  - `relativeUrlsTransformerInterceptorFn` rewrites relative request URLs based on `PlatformLocation` (http/https only).\n\n### Additional context\nI have a concrete SSRF-style proof-of-concept demonstrating server-side access to internal hosts when an app performs relative SSR `HttpClient` requests and the SSR base URL is derived from untrusted headers. I can share full reproduction steps and PoC details privately via the security reporting channel.\n\n### Environment\n- Affected behavior observed on Angular repo version: 21.1.0-next.4\n- Node: v24.4.1\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66946","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SSR examples/templates derive SSR URL from Host / forwarded headers; add guidance + safer default patte\" (#66946)"},{"Id":"3901862481","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-06T15:39:19","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"66926","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): update diagnostic to flag no-op arrow functions in listeners","State":"closed","Body":"Based on the discussion in #66294: now that we support arrow functions in event listeners, developers may write out something like `(click)=\"() => expr\"` which will be a no-op.

decimals behaves incorrectly in Signal Forms (locale IT)","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI’m experiencing an issue with numeric inputs when using the new Signal Forms API in Angular.\n\nThe main problem concerns decimal input handling, especially when using a locale where the decimal separator is a comma (e.g. it-IT).\n\nWith ReactiveForms, this behavior worked correctly, including support for comma-based decimals and proper cursor positioning.\n\n\n#### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Use an <input type=\"number\"> bound to a Signal Form control\n2. Set the application locale to it-IT\n3. Focus the input\n4. Type 1,2\n5. Press backspace to delete 2\n\n#### Expected Behavior\n\n1. The value should become 1,\n2. The cursor should remain after the comma\n3. The decimal separator should not be removed automatically\n\nThis is how the same scenario behaves when using ReactiveForms.\n\n#### Actual Behavior\n\n- When deleting the 2, the cursor jumps before the 1\n- The comma is removed\n- The input becomes 1\n- The cursor position is reset, making decimal editing very difficult\n\n#### Why this is a problem\n\nThis makes it nearly impossible to comfortably edit decimal numbers in locales that use , as the decimal separator.\nIt’s a regression compared to ReactiveForms and affects usability for non–en-US users.\n\n#### Environment\n\nAngular version: 21.1.2\nSignal Forms\nBrowser: Chrome\nLocale: it-IT\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-jjpkfi6s?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66932","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Numeric input with decimals behaves incorrectly in Signal Forms (locale IT)\" (#66932)"},{"Id":"3903005096","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-05T18:44:38","Actor":"hawkgs","Number":"66933","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(devtools): add dependencies highlighting to the signal graph","State":"open","Body":"Add ability to highlight the upstream and downstream dependencies path via the node details.\r\n\r\n_Work in progress_\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed53cede-c973-42d9-b2a5-dfc949f452b6\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/66933","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(devtools): add dependencies highlighting to the signal graph\" (#66933)"},{"Id":"3902859112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-05T18:03:53","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"66931","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update Jasmine to 6.0.0","State":"open","Body":"Jasmine enables `forbidDuplicateNames: true` by default.

(by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20320](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20320))\n\n- Added the `tsconfig` option for the `resolver` options (replacement for `tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin`). Can be `false` (disabled), `true` (use the default `tsconfig.json` file to search for it), a string path to `tsconfig.json`, or an object with `configFile` and `references` options. (by [@&#8203;alexander-akait](https://redirect.github.com/alexander-akait) in [#&#8203;20400](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20400))\n\n- Support `import.defer()` for context modules. (by [@&#8203;ahabhgk](https://redirect.github.com/ahabhgk) in [#&#8203;20399](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20399))\n\n- Added support for array values ​​to the `devtool` option. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20191](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20191))\n\n- Improve rendering node built-in modules for ECMA module output. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20255](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20255))\n\n- Unknown import.meta properties are now determined at runtime instead of being statically analyzed at compile time. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20312](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20312))\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fixed ESM default export handling for `.mjs` files in Module Federation (by [@&#8203;y-okt](https://redirect.github.com/y-okt) in [#&#8203;20189](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20189))\n\n- Optimized `import.meta.env` handling in destructuring assignments by using cached stringified environment definitions. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20313](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20313))\n\n- Respect the `stats.errorStack` option in stats output. (by [@&#8203;samarthsinh2660](https://redirect.github.com/samarthsinh2660) in [#&#8203;20258](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20258))\n\n- Fixed a bug where declaring a `module` variable in module scope would conflict with the default `moduleArgument`. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20265](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20265))\n\n- Fix VirtualUrlPlugin to set resourceData.context for proper module resolution. Previously, when context was not set, it would fallback to the virtual scheme path (e.g., `virtual:routes`), which is not a valid filesystem path, causing subsequent resolve operations to fail. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20390](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20390))\n\n- Fixed Worker self-import handling to support various URL patterns (e.g., `import.meta.url`, `new URL(import.meta.url)`, `new URL(import.meta.url, import.meta.url)`, `new URL(\"./index.js\", import.meta.url)`). Workers that resolve to the same module are now properly deduplicated, regardless of the URL syntax used. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20381](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20381))\n\n- Reuse the same async entrypoint for the same Worker URL within a module to avoid circular dependency warnings when multiple Workers reference the same resource. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20345](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20345))\n\n- Fixed a bug where a self-referencing dependency would have an unused export name when imported inside a web worker. (by [@&#8203;samarthsinh2660](https://redirect.github.com/samarthsinh2660) in [#&#8203;20251](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20251))\n\n- Fix missing export generation when concatenated modules in different chunks share the same runtime in module library bundles. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20346](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20346))\n\n- Fixed `import.meta.env.xxx` behavior: when accessing a non-existent property, it now returns empty object instead of full object at runtime. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20289](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20289))\n\n- Improved parsing error reporting by adding a link to the loader documentation. (by [@&#8203;gaurav10gg](https://redirect.github.com/gaurav10gg) in [#&#8203;20244](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20244))\n\n- Fix typescript types. (by [@&#8203;alexander-akait](https://redirect.github.com/alexander-akait) in [#&#8203;20305](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20305))\n\n- Add declaration for unused harmony import specifier. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20286](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20286))\n\n- Fix compressibility of modules while retaining portability. (by [@&#8203;dmichon-msft](https://redirect.github.com/dmichon-msft) in [#&#8203;20287](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20287))\n\n- Optimize source map generation: only include `ignoreList` property when it has content, avoiding empty arrays in source maps. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20319](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20319))\n\n- Preserve star exports for dependencies in ECMA module output. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20293](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20293))\n\n- Consider asset modulem to be side-effect free. (by [@&#8203;hai-x](https://redirect.github.com/hai-x) in [#&#8203;20352](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20352))\n\n- Avoid generating JavaScript modules for CSS exports that are not used, reducing unnecessary output and bundle size. (by [@&#8203;xiaoxiaojx](https://redirect.github.com/xiaoxiaojx) in [#&#8203;20337](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20337))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you

primarily on low-contrast background color and are not sufficiently visible (WCAG 2.4.7 / 2.4.11)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWe’ve observed a recurring accessibility issue across several Angular Material components where the keyboard focus indicator relies primarily on a subtle background color change, often without a visible outline or border.\n\nIn many cases, the focus state is indicated only by a light background shade (e.g., light grey or light blue), which is difficult or impossible to perceive, especially:\n\n- For users with low vision\n- For users with color vision deficiencies\n- In bright environments or low-quality displays\n- When components are placed on similar colored backgrounds\n\n**This affects multiple components, including (but not limited to):**\n\n- Buttons\n- Icon buttons\n- List items\n- Menu items\n- Tabs\n- Select options\n- Table rows / interactive rows\n\nWhy this is an accessibility problem\nWCAG 2.4.7 – Focus Visible (Level AA)\nKeyboard focus must be visible.\n\n- In many Angular Material components, the current focus indicator:\n- Has no distinct shape (no outline, border)\n- Is visually indistinguishable from hover or selected states\n- This makes keyboard navigation extremely difficult for users who rely on visible focus.\n\n**From an accessibility testing perspective:**\n\n- Users cannot reliably tell where focus is on the page\n- Screen magnifier users lose orientation\n- Keyboard-only users frequently get “lost” in complex UIs\n- The UI technically supports keyboard, but practically fails usability\n\nThis results in applications built with Angular Material failing accessibility compliance (WCAG) unless we manually override focus styles.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nAngular Material components should provide, by default: A clearly visible focus indicator\n\nWith a distinct visual affordance, such as:\n\n- Outline\n- Border\n\nCurrently we have to implement custom global CSS overrides just to achieve basic focus visibility, which defeats the purpose of a component library that claims accessibility support out of the box.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAngular Material components should provide, by default: A clearly visible focus indicator\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly backgroing color appears on focus, and this color is very light and very hard to notice by the users with vision impairements. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS,

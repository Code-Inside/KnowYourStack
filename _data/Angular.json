Hence, having  `effect`s working everywhere, just like signals.\r\n\r\nAnd, if we consider that developers are not \"warned enough\" / safe, we may add a property like: `runOutsideOfInjectionContext: boolean`.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```ts\r\nexport interface CreateEffectOptions {\r\n  injector?: Injector;\r\n  manualCleanup?: boolean;\r\n  allowSignalWrites?: boolean;\r\n  scheduler?: EffectScheduler;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function effect(\r\n  effectFn: (onCleanup: EffectCleanupRegisterFn) => void,\r\n  { allowSignalWrites = false, manualCleanup = false, injector, scheduler }: CreateEffectOptions,\r\n): EffectRef {\r\n  if (isInInjectionContext()) {\r\n    const injector = injector ?? inject(Injector);\r\n    const destroyRef = manualCleanup ? null : injector.get(DestroyRef);\r\n\r\n    const handle = new EffectHandle(\r\n      scheduler ?? injector.get(APP_EFFECT_SCHEDULER),\r\n      effectFn,\r\n      typeof Zone === 'undefined' ? null : Zone.current,\r\n      destroyRef,\r\n      injector,\r\n      allowSignalWrites,\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    const cdr = injector.get(ChangeDetectorRef, null, {\r\n      optional: true,\r\n    }) as ViewRef<unknown> | null;\r\n    if (!cdr || !(cdr._lView[FLAGS] & LViewFlags.FirstLViewPass)) {\r\n      handle.watcher.notify();\r\n    } else {\r\n      (cdr._lView[EFFECTS_TO_SCHEDULE] ??= []).push(handle.watcher.notify);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return handle;\r\n  } else {\r\n    return new EffectHandle(\r\n      scheduler ??

be able to set inputs of constituent directives","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the directive composition API allows us to create a \"composed directive\" that brings together one or more \"constituent directives\" (those declared in its `hostDirectives`) and the inputs/outputs of these \"constituent directive\" can be exposed (with optional aliasing) as inputs/outputs on the \"composed directive\".\r\n\r\nHowever, \r\n1. inputs/outputs of \"constituent directives\" cannot be set by the \"composed directive\", and (as a result)\r\n2. for exposed inputs/outputs, it is the responsibility of the **component** using the \"composed directive\" to set these properties directly; the \"composed directive\" is unable to transform these properties before they are passed to the \"constituent directives\".\r\n\r\nThis means that any \"abstraction\" of constituent directives is limited to aliasing of their inputs/outputs. Surely this severely limits the usefulness of directive composition.\r\n\r\n### Example of current state\r\n\r\nHere, we have a composed directive trying to set the input of its constituent directive (declared in its `hostDirectives`), but to no avail. (If it were working, we would expect the text to be green.)\r\nThis is of course a contrived example (mapping a boolean to a color string), but we can imagine that such a mapping may be much more complex, involving DI and construction of complex objects.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/directive-composition-cannot-set-inputs-from-directive?file=src%2Fmain.ts (ng18)\r\n\r\n(Note that setting the constituent directive input from the composed directive does not work, regardless of whether I declare the `hostDirectives` item as `ConstituentDirective` or `{ directive: ConstituentDirective, inputs: [\"appConstituent\"] }`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAllow composed directive to set constituent directive inputs, such that the above example works as expected.\r\n\r\n###

This behavior can cause issues, particularly for users employing plugins such as postcss-rtlcss. In Angular 17 and earlier versions, this issue did not occur.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Create a postcss.config.json file with the postcss-rtlcss plugin configured.\r\n2. Run the Angular application in development mode or build it for production.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\nPostCSS should execute once, correctly applying the postcss-rtlcss plugin and preserving specific CSS comments for RTL processing (e.g., /*!rtl:begin:ignore*/).\r\n\r\n**Observed Behavior:**\r\n\r\nPostCSS runs twice:\r\n\r\n1. The first execution correctly applies the RTL CSS transformations and respects the ignore comments, producing CSS compatible with both LTR and RTL styles.\r\n2. The second execution occurs after the comments have been removed, causing postcss-rtlcss to apply transformations again, leading to unintended CSS changes where comments were intended to prevent modifications.\r\n\r\n**Impact:**\r\n\r\nThis issue causes CSS styles to be incorrectly processed, particularly in areas where ignore comments are used to maintain certain styles. The double processing results in unexpected changes to the CSS, breaking the intended styling for both LTR and RTL directions.\r\n\r\n**Request:**\r\n\r\nPlease investigate and resolve the issue of PostCSS running twice in Angular 18+ to ensure consistent and expected CSS processing. This will help maintain compatibility with plugins like postcss-rtlcss and preserve the integrity of the styling configurations.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/oarshad/angular-postcss-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular Cli: 18.0.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27804","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"postcss in Angular 18+ version running twice\" (#27804)"},{"Id":"2343468398","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-10T16:02:27","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27807","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): Initiate PostCSS only once","State":"closed","Body":"Previously, PostCSS was initialized three times (once for each preprocessor), resulting in plugins being applied multiple times to each instance.

Previously esbuild only added the `Symbol.metadata` property to decorated classes if there was a decorator on the class element itself. However, the proposal says that the `Symbol.metadata` property should be present on all classes that have any decorators at all, not just those with a decorator on the class element itself.\n\n-   Allow unknown import attributes to be used with the `copy` loader ([#&#8203;3792](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3792))\n\n    Import attributes (the `with` keyword on `import` statements) are allowed to alter how that path is loaded. For example, esbuild cannot assume that it knows how to load `./bagel.js` as type `bagel`:\n\n    ```js\n    // This is an error with \"--bundle\" without also using \"--external:./bagel.js\"\n    import tasty from \"./bagel.js\" with { type: \"bagel\" }\n    ```\n\n    Because of that, bundling this code with esbuild is an error unless the file `./bagel.js` is external to the bundle (such as with `--bundle --external:./bagel.js`).\n\n    However, there is an additional case where it's ok for esbuild to allow this: if the file is loaded using the `copy` loader. That's because the `copy` loader behaves similarly to `--external` in that the file is left external to the bundle. The difference is that the `copy` loader copies the file into the output folder and rewrites the import path while `--external` doesn't. That means the following will now work with the `copy` loader (such as with `--bundle --loader:.bagel=copy`):\n\n    ```js\n    // This is no longer an error with \"--bundle\" and \"--loader:.bagel=copy\"\n    import tasty from \"./tasty.bagel\" with { type: \"bagel\" }\n    ```\n\n-   Support import attributes with glob-style imports ([#&#8203;3797](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3797))\n\n    This release adds support for import attributes (the `with` option) to glob-style imports (dynamic imports with certain string literal patterns as paths). These imports previously didn't support import attributes due to an oversight. So code like this will now work correctly:\n\n    ```ts\n    async function loadLocale(locale: string): Locale {\n      const data = await import(`./locales/${locale}.data`, { with: { type: 'json' } })\n      return unpackLocale(locale, data)\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously this didn't work even though esbuild normally supports forcing the JSON loader using an import attribute. Attempting to do this used to result in the following error:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] No loader is configured for \".data\" files: locales/en-US.data\n\n            example.ts:2:28:\n              2 │   const data = await import(`./locales/${locale}.data`, { with: { type: 'json' } })\n                ╵                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    In addition, this change means plugins can now access the contents of `with` for glob-style imports.\n\n-   Support `${configDir}` in `tsconfig.json` files ([#&#8203;3782](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3782))\n\n    This adds support for a new feature from the upcoming TypeScript 5.5 release. The character sequence `${configDir}` is now respected at the start of `baseUrl` and `paths` values, which are used by esbuild during bundling to correctly map import paths to file system paths. This feature lets base `tsconfig.json` files specified via `extends` refer to the directory of the top-level `tsconfig.json` file. Here is an example:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"paths\": {\n          \"js/*\": [\"${configDir}/dist/js/*\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can read more in [TypeScript's blog post about their upcoming 5.5 release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5-rc/#the-configdir-template-variable-for-configuration-files). Note that this feature does not make use of template literals (you need to use `\"${configDir}/dist/js/*\"` not `` `${configDir}/dist/js/*` ``). The syntax for `tsconfig.json` is still just JSON with comments, and JSON syntax does not allow template literals. This feature only recognizes `${configDir}` in strings for certain path-like properties, and only at the beginning of the string.\n\n-   Fix internal error with `--supported:object-accessors=false` ([#&#8203;3794](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3794))\n\n    This release fixes a regression in 0.21.0 where some code that was added to esbuild's internal runtime library of helper functions for JavaScript decorators fails to parse when you configure esbuild with `--supported:object-accessors=false`. The reason is that esbuild introduced code that does `{ get [name]() {} }` which uses both the `object-extensions` feature for the `[name]` and the `object-accessors` feature for the `get`, but esbuild was incorrectly only checking for `object-extensions` and not for `object-accessors`. Additional tests have been added to avoid this type of issue in the future.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.0.1\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.0.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1800.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                    18.0.1\r\n@angular/ssr                    18.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             18.0.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI have tried to override the esbuild version to the latest version by using the overrides command in package.json.\r\n\r\n\"overrides\": {\r\n     \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": {\r\n           \"esbuild\": \"0.21.4\"\r\n       }\r\n}\r\n\r\nAfter this I ran the scan again and yet it did not fix the issue since esbuild version 0.21.4 uses go version of 1.20.12\r\n\r\nIs there version of esbuild used by @angular-devkit/build-angular which solves this issue?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27797","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CVE-2023-45288 vulnerability in esbuild (golang version 1.20.12)\" (#27797)"},{"Id":"2337325229","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-07T00:07:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27790","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/dependency-review-action](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action) | action | patch | `v4.3.2` -> `v4.3.3` |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | dependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n| [terser](https://terser.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n| [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio)) | devDependencies | patch | [`5.31.0` -> `5.31.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/verdaccio/5.31.0/5.31.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/dependency-review-action (actions/dependency-review-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.3.3`](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/releases/tag/v4.3.3): Notes for v4.3.3\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/compare/v4.3.2...v4.3.3)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Allow slashes in purl package names by [@&#8203;juxtin](https://togithub.com/juxtin) in [https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/765](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/765)\n-   use the v3 version of the deps.dev API by [@&#8203;josieang](https://togithub.com/josieang) in [https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/741](https://togithub.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/741)\n-   PR with suggestions -

But the very next section on Validation integration has a big warning:\n\n> IMPORTANT: Don't implement validation logic in your control.\n\nAnd there seems to be a fundamental gap there:\n\n- The control may need to do validation to convert the user input into the model type.\n- The schema validation can only run once the model type is pushed out via `value`.\n\nSomething as simple as the Currency input example in the docs:\n```\nhandleInput(input: string) {\n  const num = parseFloat(input.replace(/[^0-9.]/g, ''));\n  if (!isNaN(num)) this.value.set(num);\n}\n```\n\n- If the user types a valid number, that is passed up via the `value`.\n- If they then continue typing making it an invalid number, the `value` is not changed and so the control remains valid even through they now have junk in the field.\n- The only options the control has at this point are to clear the value or leave it at the last valid value - there is no way to report what the error is to the parent schema.\n\nI would like to do this:\n```\nhandleInput(input: string) {\n  const num = parseFloat(input.replace(/[^0-9.]/g, ''));\n  if (isNaN(num)) {\n    const msg = `'${input}' is not a valid number.`;\n    // pass msg back to framework validation\n  } else {\n    this.value.set(num);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nChanging the `FormUIControl.errors` to a model signal and allowing the control to pass errors back to its parent would seem to be one solution, although I can imagine there are many implementation details with the timing of when validation is run and what happens if both the schema and the control generate errors.\n\nHere's a more complete example for a WidgetControl I am trying to convert from a `ControlValueAccessor` implementation: ([stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-tk1jhcej?file=src%2Fwidget-input.ts)):\n\n- A custom control that allows a user to type a code-number combination into a text box. The users know almost all of the ones they use and want to speed type them in.\n- I had a similar thing working using `ControlValueAccessor`: the control taps in to the model-to-view and view-to-model chains and inserts a custom Validator as the first validator in the list.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPossibly make `FormUiControl.errors` a model signal, allowing the control to pass validation errors back to the framework?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI tried to create a sub-form, but can't see how to get that to work. Ultimately I want the field to act like a any other field in the parent form:\n```\n<app-currency-input [field]=\"userForm.currency\" />\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65769","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Signal Forms: Consider allowing validation in FormValueControl\" (#65769)"},{"Id":"3682391403","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-01T23:45:06","Actor":"MeAkib","Number":"65763","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(forms): handle space-separated class names in control class bindings","State":"closed","Body":"Prevents InvalidCharacterError when a class rule contains space-separated classes.

see the error I mentioned above, but as soon as I comment out `SomeService/SomeOtherRootService` provider and remove corresponding imports `ng test` works fine!\n\n`SomeService` and

'@angular/router';\nimport {Subscription} from 'rxjs';\nimport {filter} from 'rxjs/operators';\n```\nWhat I was able to find out is that the error is thrown from `chunk-42LDSDVL.js` (a chunk compiled by Vite) while declaring the following static property on the `_PlatformLocation` class:\n```\nstatic ɵfac = ɵɵngDeclareFactory({\n    minVersion: \"12.0.0\",\n    version: \"21.0.2\",\n    ngImport: core_exports,\n    type: _PlatformLocation,\n    deps: [],\n    target: FactoryTarget.Injectable\n  });\n```\n`ɵɵngDeclareFactory` function calls `getCompilerFacade` which can't find the `_global[\"ng\"].ɵcompilerFacade` and thus throws the error.\n\nI've searched through the angular code and found that global compiler facade is published by the `@angular/compiler` module so I've added a few console logs and it appeared that in the failing scenario `publishFacade(_global)` from the `@angular/compiler`  is called **after** the `ɵɵngDeclareFactory` function is called, whereas in the successful pass it's called **before** it.\n\nSo the only assumption I currently have is that Vite under some conditions incorrectly bundles modules, or there is some Vitest misconfiguration in the `@angular/build:unit-test` runner.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSorry, couldn't easily reproduce it in the fresh Angular app.\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI       :

builder.  \nThis happens because Angular generates extremely long output filenames for test source maps, which include the **full absolute path** of the component under test.\n\nOn macOS (and some CI environments), the filesystem limits paths to **255 characters**, and the generated spec map paths exceed this limit.\n\n### Example error\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n\nWhen the project structure is nested (common in enterprise monorepos), the combined absolute path of the repo + project + feature modules + filename becomes extremely long (300–390+ chars).\n\nThis makes the test runner fail with `ENAMETOOLONG` before execution even starts.\n\n### Impact\n- Test builds cannot run on macOS  \n- CI pipelines fail  \n- Refactoring large monorepos becomes extremely difficult  \n- Developers must manually shorten folder structures even when logically correct  \n\n---\n\n## ✔ **Suggested solutions**\n\n### **Option 1 — Shorten or hash test output paths**\nEmit something like:\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n\ninstead of embedding the entire directory path.\n\n### **Option 2 — Add a configuration flag (e.g. `\"shortPath\": true`)**\nSomething

The full run of the `ng update` command is:\n\n```\nSTEP 11/13: RUN npx ng update angular-eslint@20 || true\n\n> demo@0.0.0 ng\n> ng update angular-eslint@20\n\nUsing package manager: npm\nCollecting installed dependencies...\nFound 24 dependencies.\nFetching dependency metadata from registry...\n    Updating package.json with dependency angular-eslint @ \"20.7.0\" (was \"19.8.1\")...\nUPDATE package.json (1123 bytes)\n❯ Cleaning node modules directory\n✔ Cleaning node modules directory\n❯ Installing packages\n✔ Installing packages\n** Executing migrations of package 'angular-eslint' **\n\n❯ Updates @angular-eslint to v20.\nUPDATE package.json (1123 bytes)\n✖ Migration failed: Cannot find module '../package-manager/executor'\nRequire stack:\n- /demo/node_modules/@angular/cli/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tasks/node/index.js\n- /demo/node_modules/@angular/cli/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tools/workflow/node-workflow.js\n- /demo/node_modules/@angular/cli/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tools/index.js\n- /demo/node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/update/cli.js\n- /demo/node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/command-config.js\n- /demo/node_modules/@angular/cli/src/command-builder/command-runner.js\n- /demo/node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/cli/index.js\n- /demo/node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/init.js\n  See \"/tmp/ng-E8vcjp/angular-errors.log\" for further details.\n```\n\nnote that `angular-eslint` and `@angular-eslint/schematics` were the last packages to depend on `@angular-devkit/schematics@19`, so `npm` decided to drop `@angular-devkit/schematics@19` from the root directory in `node_modules`, and move `@angular-devkit/schematics@20` there. See the `npm ls` output before the upgrade:\n\n```\nSTEP 9/13: RUN npm ls @angular-devkit/schematics\ndemo@0.0.0 /demo\n+-- @angular/cli@20.3.12\n| +-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12\n| `-- @schematics/angular@20.3.12\n|   `-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12\n`-- angular-eslint@19.8.1\n  +-- @angular-devkit/schematics@19.2.19\n  `-- @angular-eslint/schematics@19.8.1\n    `-- @angular-devkit/schematics@19.2.19 deduped\n\nSTEP 10/13: RUN grep '\"version\"' node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/package.json\n  \"version\": \"19.2.19\",\n```\n\nand after the failed update attempt (note that the package was successfully updated by `ng update`/`npm`, just the migration script crashed afterwards):\n\n```\nSTEP 12/13: RUN npm ls @angular-devkit/schematics\ndemo@0.0.0 /demo\n+-- @angular/cli@20.3.12\n| +-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12\n| `-- @schematics/angular@20.3.12\n|   `-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12 deduped\n`-- angular-eslint@20.7.0\n  +-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12 deduped\n  `-- @angular-eslint/schematics@20.7.0\n    `-- @angular-devkit/schematics@20.3.12 deduped\n\nSTEP 13/13: RUN grep '\"version\"' node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/package.json\n  \"version\": \"20.3.12\",\n```\n\nI already tried to report the issue to `angular-eslint`, as it was the update/migration process of `angular-eslint` that failed, but the issue got \"closed as not planned\" because I am supposed to update `angular-eslint` at the same time as angular according to the author of `angular-eslint`, see: https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint/issues/2807\n\nI then tried to report the issue to `angular` as documentation issue, because the documentation mentions in no way that upgrading further packages at the same time as the angular core framework migth be required. This issue also got \"closed as not planned\", because angular recommends to *not* upgrade third-party packages at the same time as the framework, but recommends a step-by-step upgrade, see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65692\n\nNoten that the issue is usually only observable in a step-by-step upgrade process, because only in that case `@angular/schematics` will first be installed as local dependency for `@angular-cli` and then moved in the last step of the upgrade, but the issue is not observable if everything is upgraded at once. Actually, I am unsure whether the issue is within `@angular/cli`, or `angular-eslint` is mis-using the angular upgrade process or specifies dependencies in a way that are not supported by the Angular project. If you can pinpoint a specific way `angular-eslint` is using angular wrong (or in an unsupported way), I am ready to report another issue and possibly a merge request to `angular-eslint`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31974","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng update may crash if npm relocates core angular packages while migrations are running\" (#31974)"},{"Id":"3681308855","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-01T16:10:22","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31987","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/schematics): remove lazy imports in node tasks","State":"closed","Body":"This commit replaces lazy imports with static imports in the node tasks of `@angular-devkit/schematics`.

This improves performance on high-core systems [#&#8203;10068](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10068).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `trustPolicy` should ignore the trust evidences of prerelease versions, when installing a non-prerelease version.\n- Handle ENOENT errors thrown by `fs.linkSync()`, which can occur in containerized environments (OverlayFS) instead of EXDEV. The operation now gracefully falls back to `fs.copyFileSync()` in these cases [#&#8203;10217](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10217).\n- Reverted: `pnpm self-update` should download pnpm from the configured npm registry [#&#8203;10205](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10205).\n- Packages that don't have a `package.json` file (like Node.js) should not be reimported from the store on every install. Another file from the package should be checked in order to verify its presence in `node_modules`.\n- Correctly read auth tokens for URLs that contain underscores [#&#8203;17](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/npm-conf/pull/17).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This improves performance on high-core systems [#&#8203;10068](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10068).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `trustPolicy` should ignore the trust evidences of prerelease versions, when installing a non-prerelease version.\n- Handle ENOENT errors thrown by `fs.linkSync()`, which can occur in containerized environments (OverlayFS) instead of EXDEV. The operation now gracefully falls back to `fs.copyFileSync()` in these cases [#&#8203;10217](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10217).\n- Reverted: `pnpm self-update` should download pnpm from the configured npm registry [#&#8203;10205](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10205).\n- Packages that don't have a `package.json` file (like Node.js) should not be reimported from the store on every install. Another file from the package should be checked in order to verify its presence in `node_modules`.\n- Correctly read auth tokens for URLs that contain underscores [#&#8203;17](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/npm-conf/pull/17).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The explicitly configured vitest-config option is ignore.\n\n```\nimport {defineConfig} from 'vitest/config'\nexport default defineConfig({\n  test: {\n    coverage: {\n      provider: 'v8',\n      reporter: ['lcov'],\n      reportsDirectory: '.target/coverage' // This option is ignored as Angular passes the path when calling vitest!\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThere are 2 possible solutions that would fit:\n\nA) Provide an option in angular.json to specifiy the coverageReportsDirectory - This would be in-line with the already existing options like `reporters`, `coverageReporters `and more.\n\n\nB) Angular should not pass the `test.coverage.reportsDirectory` to vitest if apps configured an explicit `vitest.config.ts` file with explicit configured reportsDirectory.

Now we know this is kind of an \"own risk\" scenario, especially since it's in the private folder of the @angular/build package but I am slowly losing it.\n\nSome context \nWhen we do \"ng serve\" on our own builder, _which is basically a wrapper around the default angular build_, we use ESbuild to build some packages that we want to re-use across Angular micro frontends. The code can be found in our [esbuild-adapter.ts](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/main/libs/native-federation/src/utils/angular-esbuild-adapter.ts) and our [builder.ts](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/main/libs/native-federation/src/builders/build/builder.ts). The interesting part is that we don't get an error when we remove the [AngularCompilerPlugin](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/c77a7d387cd4d453d790b7b457332615120b0278/libs/native-federation/src/utils/angular-esbuild-adapter.ts#L297C1-L300C9) which we use to pre-build our artifacts. \n\nThe error\nSince Angular 20, we have the issue that during the [serveWithVite](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/c77a7d387cd4d453d790b7b457332615120b0278/libs/native-federation/src/builders/build/builder.ts#L361C7-L361C20) and to be precise in [the line where vite is imported.](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/0b439685dda66ce190afa2da425f02b8e5c94147/packages/angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite/index.ts#L184), an heap error occurs. We thought it could be ESbuild since it's also used in the vite package, but all our tries have been without result so far. \n\n[Whe have an issue with all the context](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/issues/970). _Note:_ that all assumptions so far were wrong.  Even after ng21, the issue still persists. I thought it was a race condition [when closing/disposing the compiler-plugin](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/issues/970#issuecomment-3552223609) but this is not the case. \n\nNow I know micro frontends and using the private part of the @angular/build is for our own risk, but I would never expect a heap error. Does anyone know how this could happen or what could cause this?  Final note: It is a race condition so it happens every now and then, about 40% of the ng serve builds. It happens only on windows and you can recognize the error by the build/serve just stopping without any error. \n\nAll help is welcome, thanks a bunch in advance.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nWe have a reproducable repo: https://github.com/berkon/ng-serve-crash-reproduction (it also crashes when you update to ng21). \n\njust npm ci and npm start.

Please install either \"jsdom\" or \"happy-dom\".\nPlease install the missing packages and rerun the test command.\n```\n\nAfter that it seems like the that even though I've overwritten the output directory of the reporters and the code coverage reporters, somehow reports and code coverage reports are also outputted at `coverage/<project-name>` and `coverage/<project-name>/coverage`, but the coverage reports are missing where I actually want them (`reports/coverage`).\n\nIn dev mode, the `ui` setting seems to be ignored entirely.\n\nFurthermore, the code coverage calculation seems to be totally wrong since it's reporting 0% coverage while there practically no lines, branches, functions, or statements, but the only component that is currently present in the linked repository is tested to verify that it can render.\n\n\nI'd expect that I shouldn't need to have `jsdom` or `happy-dom` installed as dependency if I have not configured either of these environments to be used for vitest.\nI'd also expect my reports and coverage reports to be outputted where I have configured them to be outputted and that the UI is enabled when I want it to.\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI       : 21.0.1\nAngular           : 21.0.1\nNode.js           : 24.11.1\nPackage Manager   : pnpm 10.23.0\nOperating System  : win32 x64\n\n\n| Package                   | Installed Version | Requested Version |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| @angular/build            | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/cdk              | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/cli              | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/common           | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/compiler         | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/compiler-cli     | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/core             | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/forms            | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/platform-browser | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| @angular/router           | 21.0.1            | ~21.0.0           |\n| rxjs                      | 7.8.2             | ~7.8.0            |\n| typescript                | 5.9.3             | ~5.9.0            |\n| vitest                    | 4.0.14            | ~4.0.0            |\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31972","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vitest configuration partially ignore?\" (#31972)"},{"Id":"3668381491","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-26T17:31:33","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31966","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v21.1.0-next.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31966","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v21.1.0-next.0\" with changelog.\" (#31966)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3673040779","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-01T20:25:13","Actor":"lekhmanrus","Number":"32425","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/timepicker): prevent min/max validator effect on init","State":"closed","Body":"* Prevent the timepicker min/max validator effect from triggering form control value changes during initial setup.\r\n* Add appropriate unit test\r\n\r\nclose #32423","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32425","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/timepicker): prevent min/max validator effect on init\" (#32425)"},{"Id":"3673799002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-01T20:24:42","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32434","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/timepicker): valueChanges emitting on init","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the `valueChanges` stream from reactive forms was emitting on init for the timepicker input.

Another file from the package should be checked in order to verify its presence in `node_modules`.\n- Correctly read auth tokens for URLs that contain underscores [#&#8203;17](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/npm-conf/pull/17).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"engines\": {\n      \"runtime\": {\n        \"name\": \"node\",\n        \"version\": \"^24.11.0\",\n        \"onFail\": \"download\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  If the package with the Node.js runtime dependency is a CLI app, pnpm will bind the CLI app to the required Node.js version. This ensures that, regardless of the globally installed Node.js instance, the CLI will use the compatible version of Node.js.\n\n  If the package has a `postinstall` script, that script will be executed using the specified Node.js version.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10141](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10141)\n\n- Added a new setting: `trustPolicy`.\n\n  When set to `no-downgrade`, pnpm will fail installation if a package’s trust level has decreased compared to previous releases — for example, if it was previously published by a trusted publisher but now only has provenance or no trust evidence.\n  This helps prevent installing potentially compromised versions of a package.\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;8889](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8889).\n\n- Added support for `pnpm config get globalconfig` to retrieve the global config file path [#&#8203;9977](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9977).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- When a user runs `pnpm update` on a dependency that is not directly listed in `package.json`, none of the direct dependencies should be updated [#&#8203;10155](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10155).\n- Don't crash when two processes of pnpm are hardlinking the contents of a directory to the same destination simultaneously [#&#8203;10160](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10160).\n- Setting `gitBranchLockfile` and related settings via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` should work [#&#8203;9651](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9651).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

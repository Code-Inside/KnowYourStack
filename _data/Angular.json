I want to raise this again because IMO supporting `IANA` timezone names natively is a huge improvement, especially now when you can set the default timezone (which is actually an UTC offset, not a timezone) through [`DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS`](https://angular.io/api/common/DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS) token.\r\n\r\nWhy supporting `IANA` is such a big deal? Because of [Daylight Saving Time (DST)](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/statistics.html). \r\nCountries that are using DST does not have a fixed UTC offset, it depends on the season.\r\nSo setting a default timezone (which is an UTC offset) through `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` does not bring that much value today, it's even hard to think of a use case for this. For applications that let the user to set their preferred timezone in settings this token can't be utilized, you're still forced to come up with workaroundish solutions like creating a custom date pipe.\r\n\r\nThis is a default behaviour when timezone is not provided:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- \r\nBrowser timezone: Europe/Vilnius\r\nDATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS: not provided\r\n-->\r\n\r\n{{ '2022-10-29T05:00:00.000Z' | date: 'full' }} // Thursday, 29 October 2022 at 08:00:00 GMT+03:00 ✅ \r\n{{ '2022-10-31T06:00:00.000Z' | date: 'full' }} // Thursday, 31 October 2022 at 08:00:00 GMT+02:00 ✅ \r\n<!-- As you can see DST is handled flawlessly. -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow imagine we want to format all dates the same for all the users not matter on what timezone they are (maybe it's a company timezone, whatever). What `DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` value has to be provided for this to work? `UTC+2` or `UTC+3` (in case of `Europe/Vilnius` tz)? You see, you can't choose one, both are needed depending on the date you're trying to format.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- \r\nBrowser timezone: Europe/Stockholm (does not matter, can be any tz)\r\nDATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS: { timezone: 'UTC+2' }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n{{ '2022-10-29T05:00:00.000Z' | date: 'full' }} // Thursday, 29 October 2022 at 07:00:00 GMT+02:00 ❌ \r\n{{ '2022-10-31T06:00:00.000Z' | date: 'full' }} // Thursday, 31 October 2022 at 08:00:00 GMT+02:00 ✅ \r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- \r\nBrowser timezone: Europe/Stockholm (does not matter, can be any tz)\r\nDATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS: { timezone: 'UTC+3' }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n{{ '2022-10-29T05:00:00.000Z' | date: 'full' }} // Thursday, 29 October 2022 at 08:00:00 GMT+03:00 ✅ \r\n{{ '2022-10-31T06:00:00.000Z' | date: 'full' }} // Thursday, 31 October 2022 at 09:00:00 GMT+03:00 ❌ \r\n```\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd support for [`IANA`](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) time zone name in all these APIs:\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/common/DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS\r\n```\r\n{ provide: DATE_PIPE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS, useValue: { timezone: 'Europe/Vilnius' } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/common/formatDate\r\n```\r\n{{ myDate | date: 'full':'Europe/Vilnius' }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe\r\n```ts\r\nformatDate(myDate, 'full', 'Europe/Vilnius');\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIf for some reason `IANA` time zone support is **not** considered to be implemented now or in the future then I would suggest renaming the `timezone` property to `utcOffset` which would be more accurate and less confusing for developers.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48279","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support IANA time zone for date formatting\" (#48279)"},{"Id":"1467773864","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-29T09:57:40","Actor":"monsterrave","Number":"48277","RawContent":null,"Title":"SVG Elements wrapped in Component not focusable using tabindex","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncommon, core, forms\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am trying to make use of the default behaviour when a user presses Tab to iterate over input elements.\r\n\r\nI want to make SVG elements focusable by key stroke.

I have a convenience service that does alert(), confirm(), error() dialogs and hides the MatDialogModule from simple components. I don't have a great way of providing MatDialogModule for this convenience service.\r\n\r\nin the [docs](https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/api) it says:\r\n\r\n`import {MatDialogModule} from '@angular/material/dialog';`\r\n\r\nnow that i'm using standalone components,\r\nis it recommend to use:\r\n`importProvidersFrom(MatDialogModule),`\r\nin main.ts\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    // https://this-is-angular.github.io/angular-guides/docs/standalone-apis/configuring-the-router-using-standalone-features\r\n    provideRouter(\r\n      routes,\r\n      withDebugTracing()),\r\n    importProvidersFrom(HttpClientModule),\r\n    importProvidersFrom(MatDialogModule),\r\n    provideAnimations(),\r\n  ]\r\n}).catch(err => console.error(err));```\r\n\r\nI guess it wouldn't make sense to provide MatDialogModule to the convenience service separately to how I provide it to some standalone components, as then perhaps the app would have inconsistent dialogs, so in main.ts makes sense, just feels disorganised.\r\n\r\n### Affected documentation page\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/dialog/api\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26124","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(MatDialog): Document standalone import\" (#26124)"},{"Id":"1468597176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-29T20:31:28","Actor":"devversion","Number":"26123","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update version of preview deploy actions","State":"closed","Body":"Contains a fix for the missing trailing brace.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26123","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update version of preview deploy actions\" (#26123)"},{"Id":"1468564435","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-29T19:40:58","Actor":"zarend","Number":"26122","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(build): fix typo in code comment","State":"closed","Body":"Fix typo in a code comment in packages.bzl.

outline color in RTL when form-field input is disabled/focused","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in v14\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nNotice how the outline of a disabled datepicker with `dir=\"rtl\"` isn't fully grayed out:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5672108/204502634-7d8bfc56-aaeb-4879-8a6d-e34a282f3569.png)\r\n\r\nThe issue also affects regular form-fields with disabled `<input matInput>` / `<mat-select>`.\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\n\r\nIn LTR, the disabled border-color is set after the border-left property, so it works fine, but in RTL, they are set in opposite order (perhaps due to higher specificity of the CSS rule), causing the border-right property to override border-color.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5672108/204504953-e6b6d8db-b3b7-4346-8ab3-dd5fa47101da.png)\r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\nConsider replacing `border-right: 1px solid;` with individual properties to avoid implicitly setting `border-right-color` as part of `border-right`. I.e., consider replacing:\r\n```scss\r\n[dir=rtl] .mdc-notched-outline__leading, .mdc-notched-outline__leading[dir=rtl] {\r\n        border-right: 1px solid;  <--\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith:\r\n```scss\r\n[dir=rtl] .mdc-notched-outline__leading, .mdc-notched-outline__leading[dir=rtl] {\r\n    border-left: none;\r\n    border-right-width: 1px;    <--\r\n    border-right-style: solid;  <-- \r\n}\r\n```\r\n(and similarly for the left side)\r\n\r\n## Temporary workaround\r\n\r\nGlobal CSS:\r\n```scss\r\n// Temporary workaround for bug https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26115.\r\n.mdc-text-field--disabled .mdc-notched-outline__leading, .mdc-text-field--disabled .mdc-notched-outline__trailing {\r\n  border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06) !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n\r\n1.

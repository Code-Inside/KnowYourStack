It results in tests interfering with each other. One test might override something in a component that another test tries to use normally, causing failures.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this problem, we store current components/directives/modules defs before applying overrides and re-compiling.

Specifically, it's use and the way \"private\" interacts from ts within templates between the default dev and prod builds - it seems like there could be a gap here.\r\n\r\n[This question ](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27615) helps illustrate part of the issue, and has been talked about at length in a few more references (and more), [here_1](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/26393), [here_2](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/16893).\r\n\r\nWhile these talk more specifically about access methods conflicting with prop names, I wanted to bring up the interaction with templates. Issues [like this one](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27615), while they are not a problem with the framework, throwing an error that a property is \"private\" while looking at the template currently requires extra step(s) ([explained more here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/11978#issuecomment-255736505)).\r\n\r\nWhile JavaScript (default ng serve / ES5) does not care about \"private,\" tsc (default prod build) does.TS has support for letting the developer know if a private property or method is being used, but I'm not familiar with a way of seeing this in the templates. Developers who are more familiar with Angular may not have an issue here, but using a pattern like this could be a \"nice to have\" for newer/unfamiliar developers, or a timesaving naming/visual pattern when working in templates.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/styleguide#properties-and-methods\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n```\r\nng new test-ng\r\ncd test-ng\r\n```\r\nInside of app.component.ts:\r\n```\r\n  public test = 'test';\r\n  private testPrivate = 'testPrivate';\r\n  private _testPrivate = '_testPrivate';\r\n```\r\nand inside of app.component.html:\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n  {{test}}\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n  {{testPrivate}}\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n  {{_testPrivate}}\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the default `ng serve` works just fine as expected / noted above, but `ng build --prod` will fail (also as expected). The difference (at least for me) is that with the IDEs I've used, I can immediately tell by looking just at the template that `_testPrivate` probably is private- \r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nActual behavior: while it's an agreed upon mistake by the developer, no ahead of time warning for private props/methods in templates, requires additional steps.\r\n\r\nExpected: Can be a range from noting the alternative naming with underscore, adding more detail to the existing info of TS vs JS \"private\", or leave the docs alone and provide/suggest tooling out of the box that catches this at dev time.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27760","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Clarity and/or discussion on \"private\" property/method naming\" (#27760)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"392988688","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-20T21:18:19","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"13245","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update semver to version 5.6.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| semver | dependencies | minor | `5.5.1` -> `5.6.0` | [source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/npm/node-semver) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/node-semver</summary>\n\n### [`v5.6.0`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/npm/node-semver/compare/v5.5.1...v5.6.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/npm/node-semver/compare/v5.5.1...v5.6.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

We have budget sizes configured in the `angular.json`. As with any active project, the bundle size tends to increase over time. That can cause our automated pull request tests to fail on even a small code change if the change adds enough size to go over the max/min threshold (5% in this example).\r\n\r\n\"budgets\": [{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"bundle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"main\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baseline\": \"4020kb\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"minimumError\": \"5%\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"maximumError\": \"5%\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"bundle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"styles\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baseline\": \"181kb\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"minimumError\": \"5%\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"maximumError\": \"5%\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, the error is easy to identify and remedy (thanks for that!). However, this puts us in a tricky situation. \r\n> ng build --prod\r\n  \r\n> Date: 2018-12-19T20:13:36.383Z\r\n> Hash: 9ee44adbae1ca37d967f\r\n> Time: 59917ms\r\n> chunk {0} runtime.ec2944dd8b20ec099bf3.js (runtime) 1.41 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\n> chunk {1} main.2e3d8a71c52f17d81367.js (main) 1.39 MB [initial] [rendered]\r\n> chunk {2} polyfills.f31412eb35fb595ae0a2.js (polyfills) 147 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\n> chunk {3} styles.c38cc6ec26a52983595d.css (styles) 170 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\n> \r\n> ERROR in budgets, maximum exceeded for main.

This could be baked into the `build` command or a new command that would ideally be used before `build`. This would allow your budgets to update organically with your project size but large changes (like adding or removing a third party dependency) would require a manual adjustment to the budget baseline.\r\n\r\n#### Example use:\r\n\r\nAn organization has an `angular.json` file with a configuration that allows for auto updating when the difference in bundle size is less than 5%.\r\n\r\n\"budgets\": [{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"bundle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"main\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baseline\": \"4020kb\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"minimumAutoIncrement\": \"5%\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"maximumAutoIncrement\": \"5%\",\r\n                                                                   \"autoIncrement\": \"true\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"bundle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"styles\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baseline\": \"181kb\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"minimumError\": \"5%\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"maximumError\": \"5%\",\r\n                                                                   \"autoIncrement\": \"false\" // this would default to false to not break existing usage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}]\r\n\r\nUser A works and commits their final change. Before pushing a branch up, they run the optional build command (or a new command) `ng build --update-budget` and then commit the updated `angular.json`. When User B reviews the PR, they would notice that the budget baseline value was adjusted to equal the old budget +/- the delta amount of the code change. Budget sizes that exceed the min/max auto increment configuration would still throw an error and maintain their role as a warning to large bundle size changes.\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\n<!-- Please include a link to the repo if this is related to an OSS project. -->\r\n\r\nIncorporating this into version control/continuous integrated environments could be tricky as the Angular-CLI would be modifying versioned files and not the user. \r\n\r\nAn individual solution that uses the [Bundle-Budget plugin](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/plugins/bundle-budget.ts) to increment the bundle size could be built and added to a company's existing processes.\r\n\r\nFigured it was an interesting enough issue to discuss here.

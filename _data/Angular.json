It would be good if there was at least some indication of what to investigate, since the error message isn't exactly simple.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/8pfsxa?file=src%2Fapp%2Fa.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fb.component.ts,src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\nThis isn't easy to debug in bigger components as the cycles might be non-obvious.\n\n`forwardRef()` or `defer {}` or delayed imports can all help once you found the culprit, but finding the culprit is painful.\n\nIf component A relies on component B, and component B on component A again, we currently get a very cryptic and hard to debug error:\n\n```true\ncore.mjs:6637 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Éµcmp')\n    at getComponentDef (core.mjs:1664:10)\n    at extractDirectiveDef (core.mjs:16449:10)\n    at core.mjs:16585:96\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\n    at core.mjs:16585:85\n    at createTView (core.mjs:12916:59)\n    at getOrCreateComponentTView (core.mjs:12865:24)\n    at addComponentLogic (core.mjs:13602:17)\n    at instantiateAllDirectives (core.mjs:13399:5)\n    at createDirectivesInstances (core.mjs:12830:3)\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / â–³ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0\nNode: 20.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.0\n@schematics/angular             19.0.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIt's also interesting to note that WebStorm has a diagnostic for this:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4762efda-333d-4848-a113-c480f41c4835)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58802","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Cyclic imports of components need better error messages\" (#58802)"},{"Id":"2679714462","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-21T16:31:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"58797","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: minor updates to hybrid rendering docs","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nFix typos and some minor things","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58797","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: minor updates to hybrid rendering docs\" (#58797)"},{"Id":"2679819274","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-21T15:01:47","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"58799","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update to latest actions from angular/dev-infra","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58799","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update to latest actions from angular/dev-infra\" (#58799)"},{"Id":"2679567969","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-21T13:52:53","Actor":"jesusreal","Number":"58795","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update resource.md","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For now, I only need the SSR part, not making use of any other `RenderMode`, but I want to keep the doors open for later.\n\nDuring the bootstrap of the application I'm using an app initializer to get some data via HTTP. The website cannot run without it (think of getting different configurations from an API depending on the hostname), so it makes sense to get the data as soon as possible and assume the website always runs with a preloaded configuration. \n\nWhen I use [Angular SSR](https://angular.dev/guide/ssr) my builds works as expected.\nWhen I sure [Angular Hybrid SSR](https://angular.dev/guide/hybrid-rendering) my build hangs because it tries to make a request to the API which is not available on the build server. \n\nThe configuration for Hybrid SSR is:\n\n```\n// angular.json\n\"outputMode\": \"server\"\n\n// app.routes.server.ts\nexport const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [\n  {\n    path: '**',\n    renderMode: RenderMode.Server\n  }\n];\n```\n\nAs you can see, there's no pre-rendering involved. \n\nI want to use Hybrid SSR because it makes use of the same request handler during development where the normal SSR uses its own internal SSR middleware. Using the same handler seems more error-proof to me.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nFor both examples make sure to have Angular 19 installed.\n\n#### Example with Angular SSR\n\n1. `ng new v19ssr --ssr`\n2. In `app.config.ts` add an app initializer: `provideAppInitializer(() => console.log('Hello'))`\n3. In `angular.json` change the existing `prerender` to `false`.\n4. Run `ng build`\n\nObserve, that there is no `Hello` in your console.\nThis is as it should be.\n\n#### Example with Angular Hybrid SSR\n\n1. `ng new v19ssrSR --ssr --server-routing`\n2. In `app.config.ts` add an app initializer: `provideAppInitializer(() => console.log('Hello'))`\n3. In `app.routes.server.ts` switch the render mode to `Server`\n4. In `angular.json` change the `outputMode` to `server`\n5. Run `ng build`\n\nObserve, that there is `Hello` in your console, so the whole app has been boostrapped even when there is no route to prerender.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.0\n@schematics/angular             19.0.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28921","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Hybrid rendering without any pre-rendered routes should not execute application bootstrapping\" (#28921)"},{"Id":"2678916333","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-21T13:57:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28918","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): adjust code to propagate errors from Piscina","State":"closed","Body":"Ensure that errors occurring during initialization are properly propagated, as Piscina currently swallows errors during worker initialization.

As each client might have multiple environment I set each client assets in a common build configurations as it's persistent across environments and use multiple configuration for ng serve. For example\n```JSON\n\"clientA\": {\n    \"assets\": [\n        \"src/favicon.ico\",\n        {\n            \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n            \"input\": \"src/environments/clientA/assets/\",\n            \"output\": \"/assets/\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n            \"input\": \"src/assets/\",\n            \"output\": \"/assets/\"\n        }\n    ]\n},\n\"clientA-staging\": {\n    \"fileReplacements\": [\n        {\n            \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\n            \"with\": \"src/environments/clientA/environment.staging.ts\"\n        }\n    ]\n},\n```\nServing clientA is used with `ng serve configuration clientA,clientA-staging`. For some reason seems like the assets from `src/environments/clientA/assets/` are not included and I see that the browser get 404 error when trying to download an asset from there.\nWhat makes me think it is a bug with `ng serve` is that when building the app using  `ng build configuration clientA,clientA-staging` I see the assets from `src/environments/clientA/assets/` are included in the build under the assets folder and that everything working as expected when serving the produced build in a docker.\nAlso note that when changing the order and running `ng serve configuration clientA-staging,clientA` everything working as expected.\nWhen used `ng serve configuration clientA,clientA-staging --verbose` to try see some logs I see the log `GET /assets/images/brand-logo-light.svg because the client does not accept HTML.` ( `brand-logo-light.svg` is originated from `src/environments/clientA/assets/`) but I really cant tell if it's related.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate similar build configuration hierarchy as described.\nTry serving the app using ng serve with multiple configurations.\nSee if the assets are shown correctly.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.5\nNode: 18.19.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.5\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, localize, material, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.5\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.5\n@schematics/angular             18.2.5\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28914","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Multiple configurations assets issue with ng serve\" (#28914)"},{"Id":"2676026707","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-20T18:46:10","Actor":"sashaphmn","Number":"28908","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: readme","State":"closed","Body":"Hey.

This throws because of the `--max-old-space-size` V8 flag that I pass in to `node`.\n\nI traced the problem to this [PR#28758](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28758/files#diff-744ed3f38c651cf22c6347667c25646ae515662169495b75438a262757e3b476R63) which uses `process.execArgv` and passes them in as `execArgv` to the `options` of the newly-created worker. Later on `piscina` will spawn a worker with the provided options, without doing any filtering, but I figured this is the intended behavior on their part. \n\nAccording to `nodejs` when spawning worker threads, we cannot pass in any V8 flags ([ref](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options)). Also, there's an open issue https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/41103 to make worker threads stop throwing errors for unsupported options but until that is resolved my best guess is that if `process.execArgv` is to be used, then some sort of filtering should be applied on these options before passing them in to the worker's constructor.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1, Create a new application with `@angular/cli@19`.\n2.

ARIA attributes incorrectly, cannot be operated using keyboard","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nThe example code displayed for the [CDK accordion component](https://material.angular.io/cdk/accordion/examples) contains some accessibility issues:\n\n- Each entire accordion item is given `role=\"button\"` -- so when it's open, the accordion body is considered part of the accordion item's name. (This also makes it [invalid to put interactive elements inside the accordion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role#all_descendants_are_presentational).)\n- The accordion items are focusable, but there's no way to open/close them using the keyboard.\n\nThe code should probably look more like the [WAI-ARIA accordion example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion/), where the _header_ (not the entire accordion item) is a `<button>` that gets the `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes. This seems to be how [`<mat-expansion-panel>`](https://material.angular.io/components/expansion/overview) works already.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/cdk/accordion/examples","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30041","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(cdk/accordion): Accordion example code uses ARIA attributes incorrectly, cannot be operated using keyboard\" (#30041)"},{"Id":"2669983859","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T21:30:05","Actor":"pwudev","Number":"30039","RawContent":null,"Title":"State selection for checkbox fields announces both selected and not selected states","State":"open","Body":"Observe screenreader announces both selected , not selected states for each checkbox item.

To be more specific, when the component is loaded, the ink bar is visible as the \"active\" property is \"true\". After toggling, the \"active\" property value is \"false\" and the ink bar is no longer visible. **The problem comes when the \"active\" property value toggles to \"true\" again but the ink bar is no longer visible.**\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mky45h?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftab-nav-bar-basic-example.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Access to the link where the property **active** of the **mat-tab-link** is toggled every 3 seconds.\n2. After waiting 3 seconds, the \"active\" property value will be \"false\" and ink bar will dissapear. That is OK.\n3. After waiting 6 seconds, the \"active\" property value will be \"true\" but the ink bar will no longer be visible again. From this point, the ink bar will never be visible again regardless of the value of the \"this.active\" attribute.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt is expected that: \n1. When the active property of the **mat-tab-link** is **true**, then the ink bar should always be displayed.\n2. When the **active** property of the **mat-tab-link** is **false**, then the ink bar should never be displayed. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1. When the active property of the **mat-tab-link** is **true**, then the ink bar is only displayed if the component has just been loaded. Otherwise, if the \"active\" property was previously \"false\" but it got toggled to \"true\", then the ink bar will not be visible.\n2. When the **active** property of the **mat-tab-link** is **false**, then the ink bar is never displayed. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: ^19.0.0-next.2\n- CDK/Material: ^19.0.0-next.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30036","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(TabNavBar): mat-tab-link gets selected only once\" (#30036)"},{"Id":"2668344635","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T12:07:59","Actor":"msftedad","Number":"30034","RawContent":null,"Title":"Screen reader is not announcing the 'selected/unselected' state information for 'Favorite food' combo box in Windows.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nTitle: Screen reader is not announcing the 'selected/unselected' state information for 'Favorite food' combo box in Windows.\n\nObservation:\nHere, all three Screen readers are announcing incorrect information as selected for the list items in the combo box.\n\nUser Impact:\nScreen Reader users will find difficulty in getting the required information if Screen Reader is not announcing selected state for the selected list item.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nPre-Requisite:\nTurn on Screen Readers:\nNVDA: Ctrl + Alt + N\nJAWS: Ctrl + Alt + J\nNarrator: Ctrl+ Alt + Enter\nVerbosity:\nJAWS: Beginner, Highest\nNVDA: Default\nNarrator: Default\n\nRepro steps: \n\n1.

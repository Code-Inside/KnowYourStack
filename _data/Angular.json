This change is intended to make the framework lighter by relying on built-in browser capabilities. However, I've encountered an issue where `Intl.DateTimeFormat` does not provide equivalent short day names as Angular's `getLocaleDayNames`.\r\n\r\n### Using Angular:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { getLocaleDayNames, FormStyle, TranslationWidth } from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\nconst angularDayNames = getLocaleDayNames('en-US', FormStyle.Standalone, TranslationWidth.Short);\r\nconsole.log(angularDayNames); // [\"Su\", \"Mo\", \"Tu\", \"We\", \"Th\", \"Fr\", \"Sa\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using Intl:\r\n```ts\r\nconst intlFormatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { weekday: 'short' });\r\nconst intlDayNames = [];\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < 7; i+=1) {\r\n  const date = new Date(Date.UTC(2021, 0, i + 3)); // 3th January 2021 is a Sunday\r\n  intlDayNames.push(intlFormatter.format(date));\r\n}\r\nconsole.log(intlDayNames); // [\"Sun\", \"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my native language Polish situation is worse, in Intl for Sunday get e.g. \"niedz.\" (small letter, dot) instead of Angular, 3 letters \"nie\".\r\n\r\n## Where Did This Come From?\r\n\r\nIn the ECMAScript Internationalization API ([ecma402](https://tc39.es/ecma402/#datetimeformat-objects)) specification, there is a note:\r\n> It is recommended that implementations use the locale and calendar dependent strings provided by the Common Locale Data Repository (available at https://cldr.unicode.org/), and use CLDR \"abbreviated\" strings for DateTimeFormat \"short\" strings, and CLDR \"wide\" strings for DateTimeFormat \"long\" strings.\r\n\r\nThis explains why `Intl.DateTimeFormat`  uses the \"abbreviated\" format for \"short\" strings. The ICU library, which `Intl` relies on, follows these guidelines. You can check these values in the ICU data files, such as [this one for English](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/main/icu4c/source/data/locales/en.txt#L904).\r\nUnfortunately, there is no way to get the \"Short\" values from `Intl` as its \"short\" always returns \"abbreviated\".\r\n\r\n### What I Expect\r\n\r\nI doubt that ECMA or ICU will change their behavior regarding these formats. Therefore, I would like Angular to provide a solution that is compatible with the old behavior. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular Version: 18.0.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAdding a `weekdaysICU` option to `Intl.DateTimeFormat` would provide a much-needed compatibility layer for developers transitioning from Angular's `getLocaleDayNames` to the Intl API, ensuring that day names are formatted as expected without requiring additional libraries or workarounds.

The `create` method seems to register an esbuild `onLoad` handler that will [read the path as a local file](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/048df34ccb7d4ef67b5877e126c74c0db65b879c/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/stylesheet-plugin-factory.ts#L167-L170)\r\n\r\nAny URLs ending in `.less`, `.scss` or `.sass` are also affected.\r\n\r\nIn our case we can't easily remove `.css` from the imported URL, as it's defined by an imported third party CSS file.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project with `ng new`\r\n2. Install Tailwind by following the [Tailwind + Angular installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/angular)\r\n3. Add the following to `src/styles.css`: `@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/earlyaccess/notokufiarabic.css);`\r\n4. Run `npm run build`\r\n5. The build fails, as the URL is attemped to be read as a local file\r\n\r\nWhen no Tailwind config file is present, the build runs fine:\r\n1. Remove `tailwind.config.js` and the `@tailwind` lines from the CSS file, while keeping the `@import url()`\r\n2. Run `npm run build`\r\n3.

This change caused sections in our application to appear more prominent than expected. Additionally, this creates inconsistency in places where we combine custom styles that set the color of outlines by using the `outline-variant` role from the theme, and also have `mat-dividers` within.\r\n\r\nI understand that the change from #28995 is to achieve better color contrast. However, this deviates from the specification, which explains that dividers are decorative elements and have no minimum contrast requirements.\r\n\r\nhttps://m3.material.io/components/divider/accessibility\r\nhttps://m3.material.io/components/divider/specs#f7d1605e-1629-404c-86a5-0ef6848ce520\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5161b955-a4ff-4cdc-9d09-d1b1ca807908)\r\n\r\nA potential workaround can be to use the `--mat-divider-color` property and set color to the `outline-variant` token, but it would be nice if there is no need for style changes.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz links: \r\n- Angular Material **18.1.x**: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mwztdu?file=package.json\r\n- Angular Material **18.0.x**: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mwztdu-iaag8z?file=package.json\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the example using Angular Material 18.1.x. Observe that the dividers take their color from the `outline` token.\r\n2. Open the example using Angular Material 18.0.x.

PrimeNG specifically calls out that they meet the WCAG 2.1 AA standard. While Angular Material seems to put a lot of work into accessibility, it would be helpful to be able to state that the component library we use targets a specific WCAG level. \n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nmaterial.angular.io","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29492","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(Accessibility): Clarifying Accessibility target in documentation\" (#29492)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-07-31T03:30:02.1764484Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1386}

but when the input is bound to a normal object (not a signal) no change is emitted.\n\nGiven a component:\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'test-model',\n  template: '<ng-content></ng-content>'\n})\nclass ModelEmitComponent {\n\n  readonly model = model<number | null>(null);\n\n  // Set of all non-null emitted values.\n  readonly emitted: number[] = [];\n\n  @Input()\n  set setModelValue(v: number) {\n    this.model.set(v);\n  }\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.model.subscribe(v => {\n      if (v !== null) {\n        this.emitted.push(v);\n      }\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhen the `model` object is set via the old-school `@Input` and `WritableSignal.set()`, like:\n\n```html\n<test-model [setModelValue]=\"3\" />\n```\n\nThe value change is emitted, so a change listener can received it.\n\nWhen the `model` object is set using `model` input binding:\n\n```html\n<test-model [model]=\"3\" />\n```\n\nThe value change is _not_ emitted, so there is no way to know that a change occurred.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/johncrim/ng18-tests/blob/main/projects/output-emit/src/app/model-emit.spec.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nNo exception;

Then `ngOnDestroy()` hooks of singleton services are not called at the end of the SSR, which can lead to possible memory leaks in SSR. \n\n### Reason\nThe [logic for destroying the PlatformRef](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a36744e4bb946cb10c10542e6b3700cd70633666/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts#L219) is lying only at the end of the `_redner()` function body. So if an error happens earlier during the `bootstrap()` phase, the rest of the `_render()` function (including its ending which destroys the `PlatformRef`) is skipped.\n\nSince the `PlatformRef` is not destroyed, the `EnvironmentInjector` (or the `ModuleRef.injector`) is not destroyed in cascade. Therefore the `ngOnDestroy()` hooks of singleton services provided in such an injector are not invoked. This can can lead to memory leaks in custom apps which have important teardown logics (e.g. unsubscribing from RxJs observables) in their singleton services' `ngOnDestroy` hooks).\n\n### Additional flaw in case of `renderModule()`\n- in case of `renderApplication()`, the `EnvironmentInjector` is destroyed when the `PlatformRef` is destroyed thanks to [setting up a PLATFORM_DESTROY_LISTENER](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a36744e4bb946cb10c10542e6b3700cd70633666/packages/core/src/platform/bootstrap.ts#L97-L99).\n- but in case of `renderModule()`, the the main `ModuleRef` (and its injector) is not destroyed, even if the `PlatformRef` is destroyed, because in the source code of Angular we currently [we don't setup the PLATFORM_DESTROY_LISTENER](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a36744e4bb946cb10c10542e6b3700cd70633666/packages/core/src/platform/bootstrap.ts#L105-L109) in the case of `moduleRender()` flow. Moreover, we can't count on [the  `PlatformRef.destroy()` inner logic](https://github.com/Platonn/angular/blob/1b84662677cff3f913b62a573434c7778250bff1/packages/core/src/platform/platform_ref.ts#L143) which invokes `this._modules.forEach(module=>module.destroy())`, because the `this._modules` array is empty until it's populated with the main `moduleRef` [inside the `moduleDoBootstrap()` function](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a36744e4bb946cb10c10542e6b3700cd70633666/packages/core/src/platform/bootstrap.ts#L158). Unfortunately, if the [error happens early enough, e.g. during resolving the the APP_INITIALIZERs phase](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a36744e4bb946cb10c10542e6b3700cd70633666/packages/core/src/platform/bootstrap.ts#L116), the error is thrown early and the control doesn't manage to reach [the invocation of `moduleDoBootstrap()`](https://github.com/Platonn/angular/blob/1b84662677cff3f913b62a573434c7778250bff1/packages/core/src/platform/bootstrap.ts#L138) in the end of the `bootstrap()` function body. Therefore the `this._modules` array remain empty and the logic `this._modules.forEach(module=>module.destroy())` does no help - the main `ModuleRef` is never destroyed.\n\nIn other words, to fix the bug:\n- in case of `renderApplication`, it suffices to destroy `PlatformRef` even on failed `bootstrap()` function, e.g. wrap it with a `try{}` block and call the `PlatformRef.destroy()` in the `finally{}` block:\n   ```ts\n   export async function renderApplication<T>(/*...*/) {\n     /* ... */\n      const platformRef = createServerPlatform(options);\n      try {\n        const applicationRef = await bootstrap();\n        return await _render(platformRef, applicationRef);\n      } finally {\n        platformRef.destroy();\n      }\n   ```\n\n- in case of `renderModule`, we need to do the analogical fix as above (i.e. destroy `PlatformRef` in the try-finally block ) AND moreover _I believe (but please correct me if I'm wrong!)_ we should setup the `PLATFORM_DESTROY_LISTENER` [there](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a36744e4bb946cb10c10542e6b3700cd70633666/packages/core/src/platform/bootstrap.ts#L105-L109), similarly to [how we already do it for the `renderApplication` flow](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a36744e4bb946cb10c10542e6b3700cd70633666/packages/core/src/platform/bootstrap.ts#L97-L99).\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/Platonn/ng-ssr-memory-leak-bug\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.5\nNode: 20.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.5\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.5\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.5\n@schematics/angular             18.2.5\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI've provided PR with a proposed fix https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58112","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58111","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`PlatformRef` is not destroyed in SSR if error happens during the `bootstrap()` phase (e.g. when an `APP_INITIALIZER` rejects)\" (#58111)"},{"Id":"2571421015","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-07T20:36:00","Actor":"twittwer","Number":"58110","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng-content doesn't project deferrable views","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nIt is not possible to use content projection based on CSS selectors when the projected content is in a deferrable view.  \nBut it works when using `contentChildren` with structural directives and `ngTemplateOutlet`.\nI was expecting that both approaches work the same regarding deferrable views, and it would be really nice to use `@defer` in simple CSS selector based content projection as well.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ty28hm?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular v18\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58110","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng-content doesn't project deferrable views\" (#58110)"},{"Id":"2571344448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-07T20:27:54","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"58109","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update renovate configuration to automatically run generated file updates","State":"closed","Body":"Automatically update generated files when changes are made in renovate\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58109","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update renovate configuration to automatically run generated file updates\" (#58109)"},{"Id":"2571115265","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-07T20:26:55","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"58108","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update actions/checkout digest to eef6144","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/checkout](https://redirect.github.com/actions/checkout) | action | digest | `692973e` -> `eef6144` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

With ESBuild, template loading logic to be managed internally by the `AdapterResourceLoader`.\nIt looks, like currently there appears to be no way to inject custom logic into the template loading process. This limits the ability for third-party libraries to provide support for alternative template formats or to apply custom modifications during the build.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be beneficial for Angular to expose a mechanism for developers to hook into or modify the HTML loading logic. This would enable third-party libraries to support template engines like Pug or apply other transformations.\n\nWhile Angular CLI may not want to handle all possible template engines directly, allowing developers to customize the HTML loading process would open the door for greater flexibility and extensibility within the ecosystem.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28600","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Injecting Custom Template Loading Logic\" (#28600)"},{"Id":"2572093827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-08T17:11:46","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28593","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update scorecard action dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/checkout](https://redirect.github.com/actions/checkout) | action | patch | `v4.2.0` -> `v4.2.1` |\n| [actions/upload-artifact](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact) | action | patch | `v4.4.0` -> `v4.4.1` |\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.26.11` -> `v3.26.12` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/checkout (actions/checkout)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.2.1`](https://redirect.github.com/actions/checkout/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v421)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/actions/checkout/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1)\n\n-   Check out other refs/\\* by commit if provided, fall back to ref by [@&#8203;orhantoy](https://redirect.github.com/orhantoy) in [https://github.com/actions/checkout/pull/1924](https://redirect.github.com/actions/checkout/pull/1924)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/upload-artifact (actions/upload-artifact)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.4.1`](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/releases/tag/v4.4.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/compare/v4.4.0...v4.4.1)\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Add a section about hidden files by [@&#8203;joshmgross](https://redirect.github.com/joshmgross) in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/607](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/607)\n-   Add workflow file for publishing releases to immutable action package by [@&#8203;Jcambass](https://redirect.github.com/Jcambass) in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/621](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/621)\n-   Update [@&#8203;actions/artifact](https://redirect.github.com/actions/artifact) to latest version, includes symlink and timeout fixes by [@&#8203;robherley](https://redirect.github.com/robherley) in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/625](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/625)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;Jcambass](https://redirect.github.com/Jcambass) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/621](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/pull/621)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/compare/v4.4.0...v4.4.1\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.26.12`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.26.11...v3.26.12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.26.11...v3.26.12)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Then, by using \"npm link\" inside the dist folder of each lib we are able to add them to our machine's NPM registry. This allow us to go to inside each applications and run \"npm link my-lib\", creating a seamless connection between local apps and local libs . This setup helps speed up the development process, since changes to the libs will trigger it to be recompiled, which then triggers the applications to be recompiled, leading to a quick browser update. This work setup is efficient, clean, and has worked for years. However, once I updated my whole infrastructure to Angular 18, that workflow stopped working. It turns out, it seems that Angular 18 stopped supporting the symbolic links generated by \"npm link my-lib.\" That is is a big issue, because I cannot bring all apps and libs inside the same project or repo (mono repo). They belong to different organizations and must be kept separated. Also, deploying my libs to a remote npm registry every time I need to test a code change to the libs would make it very impractical.\n\nWould it be possible for the Angular team (or Angular CLI team) to bring back the ability to use \"npm link\" on Angular projects?\n\nI am sure you had reasons to drop that feature, but it is quite important for many people I know.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your help on this! =)\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nTerminal 1)\n$: cd my-lib\n$: ng build my-lib\n$: cd dist/my-lib\n$: npm link\n$: cd -\n$: ng serve\n\nTerminal 2)\n$: ng new myApp\n$: cd myApp\n$: npm link my-lib-name\n$: ng serve\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.6\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.6\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, google-maps, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.6\n@schematics/angular             18.2.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThis is a Critical issue, as it is significantly impacting the work of many teams.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28575","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Using \"npm link\" with Angular 18\" (#28575)"},{"Id":"2568123003","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-05T14:29:54","Actor":"aeslinger0","Number":"28580","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prerendered home page overwrites app-shell, causing flash of home page on non-prerendered routes","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThis is a follow-up to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28344\n\nI have an Angular 18 site in which I implemented [app-shell](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/app-shell). In my angular.json I have \"prerender\": true and \"ssr\": false and when I run ng build, I can see the shell contents in the main index.html as expected.\n\nHowever, if I add a route for the homepage such as `{ path: '', loadComponent: () => import('src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component').then(x => x.DashboardComponent) }`, then I see the prerendered content of dashboard instead of shell in the index.html. I believe this is why the dashboard content flashes for a moment when navigating to deep links for non-prerendered routes.\n\nThe workaround is to have your homepage route be something like `/home` instead of `/` and then include `{ path: '', pathMatch: 'full', redirectTo: 'home' }` in your routes, however, this redirect costs me ~300ms according to Chrome Lighthouse and I would like the canonical url of my root page to actually be my root page.\n\n How can I prerender the site including the homepage which has a route of `/`, but still have the shell display while loading deep links to non-prerendered routes?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- Create a new app by following the [app-shell](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/app-shell) pattern.\n- Modify `angular.json` to have \"prerender\": true and \"ssr\": false.\n- Add one route without parameters (which will prerender) and one route with parameters (which will not prerender)\n- Run `ng build`.\n- Notice app-shell is in the index.html.\n- Run `http-server` on the dist folder.\n- Notice that reloading on the prerendered route flashes the prerendered content of that route as expected.\n- Notice that reloading on the non-prerendered route flashes the app-shell as expected.\n- Add a component for the home page such as `ng g c dashboard`.\n- Add a route for the home page using `{ path: '', loadComponent: () => import('src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component').then(x => x.DashboardComponent) }`.\n- Run `ng build` again.\n- Notice app-shell has been replaced by dashboard content.\n- Run `http-server` on the dist folder.\n- Notice that reloading on the non-prerendered route now flashes the **dashboard content** instead of the app-shell.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.3\nNode: 22.3.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.17\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.0.4\n... animations, cdk, cdk-experimental, common, compiler, core\n... elements, forms, material, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.1\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.3\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.3\n@angular/cli                    18.2.3\n@angular/compiler-cli           18.2.3\n@angular/ssr                    18.2.0\n@schematics/angular             18.2.3\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.4.5\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28580","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Prerendered home page overwrites app-shell, causing flash of home page on non-prerendered routes\" (#28580)"},{"Id":"2567320913","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-04T20:42:07","Actor":"aparzi","Number":"28579","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: feat(@schematics/angular): add option to setup new workspace or appliâ€¦","State":"open","Body":"Introduces option `--experimental-zoneless` to setup workspace or application as zoneless mode.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

That element and it's children will not be able to be dragged/not cause the cdkDrag'ed item to be dragged. \n\n\nAs an alternative to a new directive, It should be possible to accomplish the same goal without adding a new directive by making it so that a cdkDragHandle that's disabled, inside another cdkDragHandle, (or a cdkDrag that's disabled inside another cdkDrag), will result in that element being un-dragable. As it stands, a cdkDrag in a cdkDrag will result in the parent one being moved, and a cdkDragHandle in a cdkDragHandle has no impact. I'm not sure how changing the interactions like that needs to be considered from an API stability point, and I'm also unsure if that's an acceptable option as it is not very intuitive. \n\n### Use Case\n\nThis is specifically targeted at parts of a component/component tree that have interactive elements of their own. (or where one might wish there to be interactivity)\n\n- Text inputs: Unable to highlight the text on an input with a mouse.\n- Text Area: Unable to change the size of a text area input as dragging the anchor in the bottom right corner results in the node moving instead\n- Sliders: Sliders become difficult/nearly impossible to use\n- Simply Highlighting text: Highlighting text in an element becomes difficult as the node itself will move instead of allowing the text to be selected.\n\nThis was discussed previously in #12929 and there was a response of \"You can use the cdkDragHandle directive to configure which element should be draggable\". The complexity of certain draggable components makes this nearly untenable under some circumstances unfortunately. \n\nIf I need to disable dragging on a single sibling element, I have to add cdkDragHandle to all other siblings of that element, all siblings of the element's parent, the parents parent, and so on until I reach the root dragable element itself. That process alone does not account for any margin on the element, which would have to be replaced with margin elements that also have cdkDragHandle, or other such hacks.\n\nThis only gets more complicated and unweildly the more elements you have that require disabling of the dragging.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(cdkDrag): cdkDragExclude to mark a part of the tree as should not be\" (#29827)"},{"Id":"2563706927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-04T07:15:58","Actor":"tanviriitju","Number":"29818","RawContent":null,"Title":"Getting HierarchyRequestError when opening google map in full screen view within a dailog.","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am using @angular/google-maps package in my angular app within a dialog(see the image below).

People who used Angular Material will know the whole \"Bar\" field will be pushed down a little by the button to invoke the datepacker this way, hence make these two fields look unbalanced when be put together side-by-side.\r\n\r\nSo I added the following CSS rules try to fix it:\r\n```\r\nmat-form-field.foo input { height: 3em; }\r\nmat-form-field.foo span.mat-form-field-label-wrapper { top: 0.3em; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever in the rendered CSS, I saw this for the second rule:\r\n`mat-form-field.foo[_ngcontent-cgh-c299] span.mat-form-field-label-wrapper[_ngcontent-cgh-c299] { top: 0.3em; }`\r\n\r\nThis don't work as the DOM element for .mat-form-field-label-wrapper is rendered by Angular material component, and therefore carries no _ngcontent-cgh-c299 attribute, only with class \"ng-tns-c60-3\".\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIMO, adding the [_ngcontent-cgh-c299] to the first part of CSS selector should be enough for view encapsulation. There's no need to append it to each-and-every segments of CSS selector.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nChange default behaviour may break (say if the last part is just div or span, it may apply to other components inside the scope but not previously affected), so it would be helpful to see some ViewEncapsulation options be added, or some directive like ::ng-deep that will modify the parsing rule to what I described here.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39259","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Current way of view encapsulation does not look correct to me\" (#39259)"},{"Id":"720909894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-13T22:12:56","Actor":"michaelsimsoe","Number":"39258","RawContent":null,"Title":"Service not treated as singleton when .js extension is added to service","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nnil\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nnil\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI've got a service with `{provideIn: root}`.

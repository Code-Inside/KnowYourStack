Description\n\nim on angular 20 and i am trying to play around with getting content projection to work the way i want. My component exposing a content slot looks like this:\n\n```\nimport { AfterContentInit, Component, ElementRef, inject, signal } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'projection',\n  template: `\n    <div>{{ isSlotProvided() }}</div>\n    <ng-content select=\"[slot]\">\n      <div>this is my default</div>\n    </ng-content>\n    `\n})\nexport class ProjectionComponent implements AfterContentInit {\n  private readonly elementRef = inject(ElementRef);\n\n  protected readonly isSlotProvided = signal(false);\n\n  ngAfterContentInit(): void {\n    const slotElement = this.elementRef.nativeElement.querySelector('[slot]');\n    this.isSlotProvided.set(!!slotElement);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nit has one ng-content element looking for a `slot` attribute to fill the content, otherwise its showing a div with some text. It uses ngAfterContentInit to set a boolean to whether or not it thinks the slot has been filled\n\nmy consuming component is using SlotComponent like this:\n\n```\n<projection>\n  @if (false) {\n    <div slot><span>hi there</span></div>\n  }\n</projection>\n```\n\nI would expect the projection component to be showing the default content and for isSlotProvided to be false but weirdly enough isSlotProvided is false _but the default content is not showing either_. This kind of ruins my plans to only fill the slot with content instead of showing the default under certain conditions. \n\nI can get it to work how i want but it gets pretty ugly and could easily get out of hand if there are many conditionals/ways i want to use the projection component. If you use multiple instances of the component being rendered conditionally its working how id expect:\n\n```\n@if (true) {\n  <projection>\n    <div slot>hi there</div>\n  </projection>\n} @else {\n  <projection></projection>\n}\n```\n\nwhen true is set in the if it shows the component with the slot being filled correctly, when its false it correctly shows the default behavior but as mentioned, this could very easily get out of hand. \n\nIs this a bug or a feature of the content projection system, and if its a feature is there a better way to handle this? Thanks, angular has gotten really amazing over the last few upgrades!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nI would but stackblitz sucks now and i cant even figure out

elements are not being garbage collected in an SSR application if: \n* A child component contains an  `output()` which it's parent is using\n* A component is using a `@HostListener`\n\n### How to reproduce in provided minimal sample\n* Either start the dev server or run a production build (both have the same result)\n* Open the app\n* Open dev tools\n* Click the toggle button multiple times\n* Take a snapshot of the heap\n* You now see multiple detached instances of both components which are still held in memory even though not used anymore\n\n<img width=\"2263\" height=\"633\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92076692-b35a-4db6-9eec-9bc789ef40fe\" />\n\n#### Validation\n* Remove `@HostListener` from `WithHostListener` component\n  ```ts\n  // Change this\n  @HostListener('click', ['$event'])\n  public onClick(event: MouseEvent): void {}\n\n  // to this\n  public onClick(event: MouseEvent): void {}\n\n  ```\n* Remove `WithOutput`

Create project: `npx @angular/cli@21.0.5 new coverage-v8`\n2. Add coverage provider: `npm i -D @vitest/coverage-v8`\n3. Update angular.json test options:\n```\n\"options\": {\n  \"coverage\": true\n}\n```\n4. Run tests: `npm run test`\nCoverage summary shows **91.66%** in app.ts **instead of 100%**. It reports **11/12 branches covered**; the uncovered branch is on the line where the signal is defined.\n\n_Note: On Node 22 (V8 12.x), this works flawlessly.

For a better Developer eXperience, I recompiled the docs with this custom theme.\n\nMy understanding is as follows:\n* For a custom theme, there isn't necessarily a direct, systematic relationship between `primary` and `primary-container` colors.\n* `background` properties should ideally use `--mat-sys-*` or `--mat-sys-*-container` color tokens, while the corresponding color properties should use the \"on\" variants (e.g., `--mat-sys-on-primary`) of these tokens to ensure sufficient contrast and semantic consistency.\n\n## Docs Rendering (Custom Theme)\n\nIn the live documentation at https://material.angular.dev/, you can observe an issue by modifying the CSS in the Developer Tools. Setting the following variables:\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  --mat-sys-primary: #005cbb;\n  --mat-sys-primary-container: #096bd0; /* Close to #005cbb, or even equal to it */\n  --mat-sys-on-primary: #fff;\n  --mat-sys-on-primary-container: #fff;\n}\n```\n\ncauses the navbar items to become nearly invisible, especially when `--mat-sys-primary-container` is identical to `--mat-sys-primary`.\n\n<img width=\"734\" height=\"492\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6f0115e-5e80-4683-b33a-199fc876dc9c\" />\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe `app-navbar` component applies the following style:\n\n```css\n[_nghost-ng-c3920750817] {\n  color:var(--mat-sys-primary);\n  background:var(--mat-sys-primary-container);\n}\n```\n\nChanging the `color` to `var(--mat-sys-on-primary-container)` only affects the theme selector:\n\n<img width=\"750\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56b35260-b032-4b9d-a285-6c10ae566ffb\" />\n\nThe other navbar items are affected by this rule, which defaults to the primary color:\n\n```css\n.mat-mdc-button:not(:disabled) {\n  color:var(--mat-button-text-label-text-color, var(--mat-sys-primary))\n}\n```\n\nFrom my current understanding, the theme selector and the buttons should rather use a \"--mat-sys-on-*\" value, as they are used for a text/foreground color.\n\n## Possible fixes\n\nBased on this analysis, several approaches could address the button color issue:\n\n- Use tonal buttons instead of basic buttons in the navbar.\n- Override the `.mat-mdc-button:not(:disabled)` rule specifically within the navbar to use a different color, such as a \"--mat-sys-on-*\" value.\n- Modify the overall background color of the navbar.\n\nIf any of the button solutions are applied, the theme selector's styling should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Next steps\n\nPlease feel free to close this issue if this behavior is intentional or already known, considered a minor issue, or if my understanding of the primary and primary container color usage is incorrect.\n\nIf this issue worth to be fixed, I am willing to create a PR. Please indicate which of the proposed approaches (or any others) would be the most suitable solution.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32619","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(navbar): navbar color usage (primary and primary-container tokens)\" (#32619)"},{"Id":"3795939499","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T08:20:26","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32626","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(cdk/overlay): revert internal workaround again","State":"closed","Body":"Once again reverts the internal workaround, now that the internal codebase has had a chance to settle.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32626","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(cdk/overlay): revert internal workaround again\" (#32626)"},{"Id":"3798721049","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-09T23:55:01","Actor":"shanti-razr","Number":"32628","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): Talkback cannot navigate long dropdowns","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen navigating through a mat-select element using Talkback on an Android mobile device, dropdowns with many options cause the page to not maintain focus and result in major jittering and page UI issues.

The element that is being focused should be indicated to the user.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSwipping left and right with standard mobile screen reader navigation on long dropdowns results in UI reloading errors and focus issues. Occasionally, the first or last few elements will function normally but issues occur at the midpoints of these lists.\n\nLooking at other UIs that have a similar element the Multiple Search Selection \"state\" field [here](https://semantic-ui.com/modules/dropdown.html) seems very good, UI focus is maintained and there are no large reloading jumps when navigating. Though this is an arbatray dropdown example, and I am sure there are other ones that could be identified.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.0.6\n- CDK/Material: 20.2.9\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): Talkback cannot navigate long dropdowns\" (#32628)"},{"Id":"3794553682","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-08T22:56:21","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32625","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v21.1.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32625","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v21.1.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#32625)"},{"Id":"3794541094","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-08T21:37:46","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32624","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v21.0.6 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"21.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32624","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v21.0.6 release\" (#32624)"},{"Id":"3794538911","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-08T21:36:56","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"32623","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v21.0.6\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32623","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v21.0.6\" with changelog.\" (#32623)"},{"Id":"3792809072","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-08T17:19:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32622","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(multiple): remove checks for popover from test","State":"closed","Body":"After #32422 all our test environments should support popovers.

That class changes `box-sizing` and horizontal padding, which can change the effective wrapping width.

This issue occurs at certain browser zoom levels (e.g., 110%) where fractional pixel values get truncated by the browser.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is in the `_measureScrollHeight()` method, which subtracts `4` from the measured `scrollHeight` to account for the 2px top and bottom padding added by the measuring class. However, when the browser truncates fractional pixels (e.g., `20.4px` becomes `20px`), subtracting `4` can result in a height that's slightly less than what's actually needed, causing a scrollbar to appear.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nChanged the subtraction value from `4` to `3.5` in `_measureScrollHeight()`. This provides a small margin that accounts for fractional pixel truncation, preventing scrollbars from appearing when using decimal line-height values.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- **`src/cdk/text-field/autosize.ts`**: Changed subtraction value from `4` to `3.5` in `_measureScrollHeight()` method\r\n- **`src/cdk/text-field/autosize.spec.ts`**: Added test `'should not show scrollbar with decimal line-height values at 110% zoom'` that verifies the fix and would fail if the value was `4`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Added a unit test that simulates the fractional pixel truncation scenario\r\n- Test verifies that no scrollbar appears when using decimal line-height values\r\n- Test would fail if the subtraction value was `4`, ensuring the fix is properly validated\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- **Breaking changes**: None\r\n- **Behavior change**: Textareas with decimal line-height values will no longer show unnecessary scrollbars\r\n- **Browser compatibility**: Fixes the issue in Chrome and Edge (and potentially other browsers) at certain zoom levels","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32611","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/text-field): fixed auto-size line-height bug at 110% zoom\" (#32611)"},{"Id":"3774439243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-02T13:32:21","Actor":"g-cheishvili","Number":"32609","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(aria/accordion): make `AccordionGroup` and `AccordionTrigger` members protected for extensibility","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request refactors the `AccordionGroup` and `AccordionTrigger` classes to improve extensibility and internal access for derived classes.

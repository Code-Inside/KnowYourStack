This avoids accidentally using the index signature type when a more explict type was intended, catching many typos. For example, it would catch:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface Foo {\r\n  bar: string;\r\n  [prop: string]: any;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst foo: Foo = /* ... */;\r\nfoo.bar; // string\r\nfoo.abr; // Error...\r\nfoo['abr']; // any\r\n```\r\n\r\nMotivation for this is an upcoming `CompilerOptions` change for extended template diagnostics which will require adding `{[prop: string]: any}` to remain compatible with TypeScript's existing types while having a more flexible `tsconfig.json` structure.\r\n\r\nIt's only really needed in the `compiler-cli` package, but I put this in `packages/tsconfig.json` to be consistent across the whole repository. If that's too broad, I can narrow it down to `packages/compiler-cli/tsconfig.json`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Build related changes","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44374","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: enable `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`\" (#44374)"},{"Id":"1071051653","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-03T23:57:15","Actor":"henrikdahl8240","Number":"44373","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 13.0.3 Type guards do not work","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nIn Angular 13, as you use a type guard in a template like *ngIf=\"myMammal.IsDog()\", the compiler does not take the type the type guard resolves into consideration.

The closest things that exists are probably NPM and GitHub, which tend to be tagged \"schematics\" by convention, which is not intuitive to look for. The lack of discoverability makes it harder for user schematics to find their users beyond simple word of mouth.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe should consider some kind of search functionality (either within the Angular CLI `ng add --search` or something in `schematics` directly) which looks for compatible packages on NPM. \"Compatible\" packages could be identified by inspecting the contents for the relevant JSON files or just looking for a \"schematics\" tag. Using a specific tag in the CLI could also help the community standardize on a particular convention to improve consistency. This could help improve discoverability of schematics.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe most obvious workaround is to search for schematics via your favorite search engine or directly on NPM. These are reasonable approaches, but will vary wildly in quality and may not be obvious to many devs who may not know what tags to search for.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22287","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Search schematics\" (#22287)"},{"Id":"1069548004","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-02T18:04:31","Actor":"alessandro-tucci-visiontech","Number":"22280","RawContent":null,"Title":"The dependence on @ampproject/remapping@1.0.1 should be updated to 1.0.2 due to a blocking issue during `ng build`","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [X] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular@12.2.13`  depends on `@ampproject/remapping@1.0.1`, which is affected by this blocking issue: https://github.com/ampproject/remapping/issues/153\r\n\r\nThe issue was quickly fixed and a new version `@ampproject/remapping@1.0.2` was released just yesterday.\r\nLike reported in the linked page, the issue affects all the projects having at least one library containing at least one .js file made up of just a source map and no additional content.

Works great, but removes the transition animation between the tabs (sliding left / right). \r\n\r\nThere are some other related issues about it: #15570, #18169\r\n\r\nI cannot accept the answer that I should use `mat-tab-group` instead. The reason using `mat-tab-nav-bar` is the tab navigation over URL, etc. Or do you generally not recommend this? If yes why?\r\n\r\nThe workaround in the other solution works. But I wonder, why not just implement this this framework? Since the `mat-tab-group` already has this animation. What is the reason for refusing such a legitimate request?\r\n\r\nI don't like to write code / workaround for stuff that should actually be part of the framework. Custom data with index for the animation, etc. \r\n\r\nNo offense, I was just wondering what the problem is. Together we could think about an elegant solution. Maybe a directive for the `router-outlet` container? But how to detect left and right sliding? (See workaround #18169)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nJust be consistent to `mat-tab-group`. Why not? Why should we regret implementing tab navigation using `mat-tab-nav-bar`. Which is an awesome feature?

That is, they may or may not exist, base on a condition.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the following should work:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"myCondition ? subMenu : null\">{{ name }}</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current Workaround\r\nHowever, since matMenuTriggerFor cannot be null, the above code does not compile. The current solution is duplicating code with `*ngIf`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item *ngIf=\"myCondition\" [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">{{ name }}</button>\r\n<button mat-menu-item *ngIf=\"!myCondition\">{{ name }}</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why This is Needed\r\nAt first sight, it doesn't look that terrible, but as we start to add other attributes (classes, i18n suff, and other directives), and as the button content also becomes richer (with icons and internationalized text). The code duplication is hard to maintain and can easily introduce bugs in our app.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following code:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nwith the current workaround, the code grows to:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  *ngIf=\"myCondition\" class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n<button mat-menu-item  *ngIf=\"!myCondition\" class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething()>\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nwith this proposal, the code would only need to be modified slightly:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"myCondition ? subMenu : null\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Note**: Creating a bogus empty submenu does not work as a workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nVery often I find the need to have a menu, where their submenus are conditional.

I added Angular Material with the official `ng` command and imported  the Angular Modules. I moved the Material Theme import from `angular.json` into the SCSS file of the component and added `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDOM`.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Clone the repo: git@github.com:rothsandro/ng-ripple-issue.git\r\n2. Move into the directory and install all deps: `cd ng-ripple-issue && npm i`\r\n3. Start the project: `npm start`\r\n4. Open `localhost:4200/` in Safari\r\n5. Click on the list selection items and the button\r\n\r\nThe problem does not occur without Shadow DOM. When I change the encapsulation to `None` the issue is gone. The problem cannot be reproduced in Brave.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe ripple effect should only be visible inside the selection item and inside the button.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe effect is visible over the whole page sometimes.

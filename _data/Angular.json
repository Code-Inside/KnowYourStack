There is one change detection triggered by `readystatechange` event and another one triggered by `load` (also see the call trees in the screenshot below).

Now it works fine in Chrome and Edge.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nThe problem is that all content inside heading cell with sorting is wrapped into button\r\n`src/lib/sort/sort-header.html`\r\n```  \r\n  <button class=\"mat-sort-header-button\" type=\"button\"\r\n          [attr.disabled]=\"_isDisabled() || null\"\r\n          [attr.aria-label]=\"_intl.sortButtonLabel(id)\"\r\n          (focus)=\"_setIndicatorHintVisible(true)\"\r\n          (blur)=\"_setIndicatorHintVisible(false)\">\r\n    <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n  </button>\r\n```\r\nBut in Firefox clicking any children elements won't work because it is nested inside a button.

Then behaviour would be the same in every browser. Using of `a` tag is not such nice as `div`, but it allows to keep tab-navigation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14456","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Additional interactive elements in matSort header cell in Mozilla Firefox\" (#14456)"},{"Id":"389491005","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-10T21:19:50","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"14455","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(autocomplete): adding aria-activedescendant while closed if autoActiveFirstOption is enabled","State":"open","Body":"Fixes the autocomplete trigger setting its `aria-activedescendant` attribute while the panel is closed and the options aren't in the DOM, if the `autoActiveFirstOption` is enabled.\r\n\r\nFixes #14453.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/14455","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(autocomplete): adding aria-activedescendant while closed if autoActiveFirstOption is enabled\" (#14455)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2018-12-12T05:30:09.3328937Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":7835}

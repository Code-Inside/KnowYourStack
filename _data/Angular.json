I apologize if this has already been reported or if this is not the correct repo.\n\nWhen I add `\"typeCheckHostBindings\": true` to my tsconfig.json, I get some errors trying to compile my application.\n\nIf I bind to just `keydown`, this code appears to be perfectly-typed:\n\n```\n@Directive({\n  host: {\n    '(keydown)': 'onKeydown($event)'\n  },\n})\nexport class ValidDirective {\n  protected onKeydown(_: KeyboardEvent): void {}\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if I bind to a specific key, I get error TS2345 and this code no longer compiles:\n\n```\n@Directive({\n  host: {\n    '(keydown.enter)': 'onKeydown($event)'\n  },\n})\nexport class InvalidDirective {\n  protected onKeydown(_: KeyboardEvent): void {}\n}\n```\n\nI am able to change some of my callback functions to the more generic `Event` type to appease the compiler, but it feels wrong because if I log the event, the browser reveals that it is actually in fact of type `KeyboardEvent`.\n\n<img width=\"849\" height=\"44\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36891514-c7ba-4fd4-bf31-911f7b6de3a6\" />\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-gceqw6kx\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nTS2345: Argument of type 'Event' is not assignable to parameter of type 'KeyboardEvent'.\n  Type 'Event' is missing the following properties from type 'KeyboardEvent': altKey, charCode, code, ctrlKey, and 17 more.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.1.6\nNode: 22.17.1\nPackage Manager: npm 11.4.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 20.1.7\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.6\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.6\n@angular/build               20.1.6\n@angular/cli                 20.1.6\n@schematics/angular          20.1.6\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63170","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Cannot enable typeCheckHostBindings with specific keydown bindings\" (#63170)"},{"Id":"3323422365","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-14T22:15:55","Actor":"akib1997","Number":"63165","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): add next step guides reference","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This means I have to pass a variable through the entire component tree and manually apply it to every animated element:\n\n```\n<div class=\"parent\">\n  \n  @if (show()) {\n\n    <!--Here we can disable all children animations when switching show() signal-->\n    <app-child-component>\n\n      <!--Assume this is template of app-child-component:-->\n      \n        @for (product of products(); track product.id) {\n          \n          <div [animate.enter]=\"animationsDisabled() ? null : 'expand'\"\n               [animate.leave]=\"animationsDisabled() ? null : 'collapse'\">\n                  ...\n          </div>\n          \n        }\n    \n    </app-child-component>\n    \n  }\n  \n</div>\n```\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a mechanism to disable leave, enter, or both animations for a specific DOM subtree:\n\n```\n<!--Example 1: disable all animations for the whole DOM subtree by default-->\n<div [animate.disabled]=\"condition()\">\n</div>\n\n<!--Example 2: disable only enter or leave animations-->\n<div [animate.enter.disabled]=\"condition()\">\n</div>\n\n<div [animate.leave.disabled]=\"condition()\">\n</div>\n```\n\nIdeally, these attributes should be host-bindable or even changeable programmatically.\nThere is one limitation I haven’t been able to solve with the current `[@.disabled]` syntax: it is not possible to disable animations exactly before a component is destroyed, because the `OnDestroy` hook is invoked too late. So it will be great to address it as well.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nManual `condition()` for every animated element.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63161","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide alternative to [@.disabled] for new animate syntax.\" (#63161)"},{"Id":"3321822377","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-14T11:14:33","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"63159","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency patch-package to v8 (20.2.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [patch-package](https://redirect.github.com/ds300/patch-package) | devDependencies | major | [`^7.0.0` -> `^8.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/patch-package/7.0.2/8.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>ds300/patch-package (patch-package)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/ds300/patch-package/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#800)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/ds300/patch-package/compare/3d407bd94e0437eade23bb5f7482d6c0a1460459...v8.0.0)\n\n- Add support for multiple patch files for a single package.

Regular validation errors didn't carry their field because it was assumed it could be trivially inferred from context.\r\n\r\nError summaries (which are forthcoming) break this assumption, as they combine both regular and tree validation errors from an entire form into a single list. Without explicitly carrying their associated field, there's no way of knowing to which field a regular validation error is associated when obtained through an error summary.\r\n\r\nNote that while all validation errors now have a field, it's not explicitly required to define one when returning an error from a logic function callback in `validate()` or `validateTree()`. These functions will automatically add the current field by default to any errors missing a field definition. This ensures that all validation errors returned from fields (e.g. `field.path.errors()`) _do_ have a defined field.\r\n\r\nThis change makes testing errors by equality more tedious; however, we only do so in our own tests to be comprehensive. In reality, it's expected that developers would simply check for an expected `error.kind` or similar property of a custom error.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63148","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): add associated field to all validation errors\" (#63148)"},{"Id":"3319785285","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T20:28:46","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63147","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.2.0-rc.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63147","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.2.0-rc.1 release\" (#63147)"},{"Id":"3319781155","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T20:27:08","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.2.0-rc.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63146","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.2.0-rc.1\" with changelog.\" (#63146)"},{"Id":"3319738218","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T20:18:56","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63145","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v20.1.7 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"20.1.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63145","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v20.1.7 release\" (#63145)"},{"Id":"3319730212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T20:11:39","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63144","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.1.7\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63144","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.1.7\" with changelog.\" (#63144)"},{"Id":"3319290250","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-13T18:13:01","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"feat(platform-browser): Add IsolatedShadowDom encapsulation m…","State":"closed","Body":"…ethod (#62723)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit d24d5742db694604b09d57a3503e8c32751c4836.

This broke basic type inference in all RxJS Observables. The only reasonable solution I found was to upgrade to the unsupported version `\"rxjs\": \"~7.5.0\",`. Perhaps Angular should recommend that in the [documentation](https://angular.dev/reference/versions)?\n\nOddly I didn't find anything related to this anywhere. I can reproduce this systematically just by changing rxjs' version. Perhaps it could be also due to some other setting in tsconfig, so I'm adding it too.\nThanks\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.2.15\nNode: 22.15.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 4.6.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.14\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... router, service-worker\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1802.20\n@angular-devkit/core         18.2.20\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.15\n@angular/build               19.2.15\n@angular/cdk                 18.2.14\n@angular/cli                 19.2.15\n@schematics/angular          19.2.15\nrxjs                         7.4.0\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compileOnSave\": false,\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noImplicitReturns\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"noImplicitAny\": false,\n    \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": false,\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"inlineSources\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"importHelpers\": true,\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"lib\": [\n      \"ES2022\",\n      \"dom\"\n    ],\n    \"paths\": {},\n    \"useDefineForClassFields\": false\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"**/*.spec.ts\",\n    \"src/**/*.e2e.ts\"\n  ],\n  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\n    \"strictInjectionParameters\": true,\n    \"strictInputAccessModifiers\": true,\n    \"strictTemplates\": true,\n    \"trace\": false\n  }\n}\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30893","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"moduleResolution \"bundler\" breaks type inference in RxJS 7.4.0\" (#30893)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3323528979","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-14T20:33:08","Actor":"danielschmitz","Number":"31703","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MAT TAB): Mat-tab-group dont change properly in Lazy Loading Mode & selectedIndex","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was \n\nmaterial 19.1.5\n\n### Description\n\nim using a Mat-Tab-Group with  `<ng-template matTabContent>`  to create a wizard (lazy), but the MatTab.selectedIndex don't work properly.\n\nExample: \nhttps://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/danielschmitz/tabs-as-wizard\ndemo: https://danielschmitz.github.io/tabs-as-wizard/\ncode: https://github.com/danielschmitz/tabs-as-wizard\n\nClick \"Next\" Then \"Back\" ... dont works... but if click at radio.. the page back to 0 :-(\n\nSee\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56cfb6d0-1972-49b8-a73d-4c2d86c0dd82)\n\nMy simple code:\n\na mat-tab with selectedIndex\n\n```html\n<mat-tab-group [(selectedIndex)]=\"selectedIndex\">\n  <mat-tab label=\"Step 1\">\n    <ng-template matTabContent>\n    <mat-card>\n      <mat-card-title>Step 1 - Basic Info</mat-card-title>\n      <mat-card-content>\n            ..... form........\n      </mat-card-content>\n      <mat-card-actions>\n        <button mat-stroked-button color=\"primary\" (click)=\"prevTab()\" [disabled]=\"isFirst\">Back</button>\n        <span class=\"spacer\"></span>\n        <button mat-raised-button color=\"primary\" (click)=\"nextTab()\" [disabled]=\"isLast\">Next</button>\n      </mat-card-actions>\n```\n\nThe `prevTab` code:\n\n```ts\nnextTab(): void {\n    if (!this.isLast) this.selectedIndex++;\n  }\n\n  prevTab(): void {\n    if (!this.isFirst) this.selectedIndex--;\n  }\n```\n\nAngular 19 & 20\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/danielschmitz/tabs-as-wizard\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

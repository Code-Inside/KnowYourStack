Each of them uses a router outlet to display content. The maximum number of openable windows is limited by the number of different outlets in the router config.\r\nUnfortunately, we found out, that increasing the number of sibling outlets with (the same) children routes leads to an exponential slowdown.\r\nThe debugger shows that the Recognizer.processSegmentAgainstRoute function is causing the bad performance.\r\n\r\nIn the provided stackblitz example this function takes the following times on my machine:\r\n20 outlets - 10ms\r\n200 outlets - 954ms\r\n2000 outlets - 187000ms\r\n\r\nIn our real project, these times are somewhat higher. So using a not unrealistic (20-30) number of windows already leads to long tasks.\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ldbunw?file=src/app/app.module.ts\r\n\r\nNavigation will be slow when clicking the links.

Complete the first two milestones.\r\n2. Follow the instructions in [Add heroes functionality](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#add-heroes-functionality).\r\n3. The [Route Parameters](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#route-parameters) section is where things start to get confusing. The text refers to this code\r\n```html\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"['/hero', hero.id]\">\r\n```\r\nbut it doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the original Tour of Heroes tutorial; neither in [Part 4 (Services)](https://stackblitz.com/angular/dkjekblappg?file=src%2Fapp%2Fheroes%2Fheroes.component.html) nor in [Part 5 (In-App Navigation)](https://stackblitz.com/angular/lkeoljvavbl?file=src%2Fapp%2Fheroes%2Fheroes.component.html).\r\n\r\n4. In the following section, [`ActivatedRoute` in action](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#activated-route-in-action), we're told to paste the following code in `ngOnInit()`\r\n```typescript\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.hero$ = this.route.paramMap.pipe(\r\n    switchMap((params: ParamMap) =>\r\n      this.service.getHero(params.get('id')))\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut this yields several compilation errors because neither the `hero$` property in `HeroDetailComponent` nor the `getHero` method in `HeroService` have been declared yet. (`getHero` is defined in Part 5 of the TOH Tutorial, but the page refers to Part 4.)\r\n\r\nThe same section also contains this paragraph:\r\n\r\n> AsyncPipe handles the observable subscription and the component's hero property will be (re)set with the retrieved hero.\r\n\r\nHowever, `hero-detail.component.html` doesn't contain any references to `hero$`, nor does it contain the `async` pipe. It _does_ refer several times to the `hero` property, so I tried to replace these references with `(hero$ | async)` but this turns out to be illegal in the context of a two-way binding using `[(ngModel)]`.\r\n\r\n5.

That library is linked via package.json (local file reference as it is in a mono-repo style git repository). This library is quite large and it takes time for webpack to re-pack it. The contents get put into `vendor.js` as we have `vendorChunk` set to true. It would be nice to be able to have our library be able to be put in its own chunk file so that the vendor chunk rarely ever changes during a release (it is uncommon for us to change other packages during a release).\r\n\r\nWhile this may be possibly using tools like `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser` it would be nice to have greater customization of the chunks that are created via the core builder and angular.json.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nNew `additionalChunks` section of angular.json configuration for the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` builder.\r\nIt would allow glob matching to customize the chunks.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"additionalChunks\": {\r\n    \"myLib\": [ \"node_modules/myLib/**\" ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would package the \"myLib\" Angular library as \"myLib.[hash].js\" in the output of ng build (and a separate file for serve)\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n`@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19721","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support custom chunks for webpack / separate

The reason is when using Angular CLI there is no way of including `ng-annotate` as part of the pipeline for the AngularJs bits.\r\n\r\nWhat is the 2021 way of using ng-annotate for hybrid applications?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI would like a \"plugins\" section where I could specify \"ng-annotate\" and only for files that match a regex (the AngularJs files).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI've considered:\r\n1. **Ejecting the configuration and not using ng-cli.** I don't like this solution as I want to use Angular CLI and reduce customizations (so upcoming upgrades are smoother).\r\n1. **Running ng-annotate on each of the Angular files by hand, and permanently replacing the original files.** But it's rather involved, I'd need to write a script that:\r\n    - Removes the imports from the top of my files (because ng-annotate doesn't like \"imports/exports\" in non-module files).\r\n    - Runs ng-annotate in each one, redirecting the output to a file, then swapping the files.\r\n1. **Continuing to use the non-optimized version of my product in production**. My company's product is quite large, and it is taking several seconds to download and bootstrap, so this is exactly what I want to avoid.\r\n1. **Using a custom webpack config prepended to ng-cli's one.** I found it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59302237/how-to-use-ng-annotate-with-hybrid-app-based-on-angular-cli).\r\n\r\nSo far it looks like number 4 is what I'm going to try, otherwise doing number 2.

Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to work if the `FocusMonitor` is on a parent element and set up with `checkChildren = true`. This is because the check here (https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20966/files#diff-02e96e7ea6a7d8f1caecdfdbb7cb38bdcdc5c43db34e4392723cc48765e330b7R316) fails, as `nativeElement` doesn't have a registered `FocusMonitor`. The `FocusMonitor` is instead registered on the parent.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-un8eee?file=src/app/hello.component.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open DevTools and watch the classes on `document.body`. There is a `FocusMonitor` attached to the `document.body`.\r\n1. Click on the button \"Focus test button with origin\". Note that the class `.cdk-mouse-focused` is first added, and then 5 seconds later, is replaced by the class `.cdk-keyboard-focused`. This is expected behavior. When this button is clicked, it calls `focusVia` wth `keyboard` origin on the \"Test\" button after 5 seconds.\r\n1. Now, again click on the button \"Focus test button with origin\". After clicking, and within 5 seconds, click on the button \"Test\". Now observe that the class `.cdk-mouse-focused` is present, and never changes to `.cdk-keyboard-focused`. **This is not expected behavior.** I'd expect the class to change to `.cdk-keyboard-focused` due to the fix https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20966. Unfortunately it doesn't, because the check `this._elementInfo.has(nativeElement)` fails within `focus-monitor.ts`.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: Latest\r\n- CDK/Material: Latest\r\n- Browser(s): All\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): All\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21500","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(FocusMonitor): Focus origin of already focused element doesn't change if FocusMonitor is on parent with checkChildren set to true.\" (#21500)"},{"Id":"779637418","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T22:02:23","Actor":"MichaelJamesParsons","Number":"21499","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/datepicker): expose year view change detector ref","State":"open","Body":"Open up the mat year view's `ChangeDetectorRef`  so it can be accessed by other components.

Now VoiceOver started reading out both \"not selected\" and \"selected\" for each option, e.g. \"Coffee not selected, selected (5 of 10)\".

I decided to add some logic to convert them automatically, because creating `LatLng` requires the Maps API to have been loaded which can lead to race conditions if it's being loaded lazily.\r\n\r\n![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4450522/103477692-e45d0a00-4dc9-11eb-9f92-6a8f7b2c4614.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21489","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(google-maps): add heatmap support\" (#21489)"},{"Id":"777446542","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-02T11:36:07","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"21488","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix compilation errors in utility scripts","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a few compilation errors in some utility scripts that haven't been caught by the CI.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21488","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: fix compilation errors in utility scripts\" (#21488)"},{"Id":"777436148","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-02T10:04:00","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"21487","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/datepicker): add support for cancel/apply buttons","State":"open","Body":"Adds support for projecting in \"Cancel\" and \"Apply\" buttons in `mat-datepicker` and `mat-date-range-picker`.

It can recognize if the prop is misspelled, but it would not give any error if I passed a string into propName1 or anything else like that.\r\n\r\nAccording to typescript rules, the interface's typings should get merged with the class's typings.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.2.6\r\nNode: 16.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.6\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.5\r\n@angular/cli                    14.2.6\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.6\r\nrxjs                            6.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48056","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Types from split classes/interfaces do not get checked in templates\" (#48056)"},{"Id":"1448668649","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-14T20:09:20","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"48055","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v15.0.0-rc.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"15.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48055","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v15.0.0-rc.4 release\" (#48055)"},{"Id":"1448660504","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-14T20:05:46","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"48054","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v15.0.0-rc.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48054","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v15.0.0-rc.4\" with changelog.\" (#48054)"},{"Id":"1447619320","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-14T19:28:18","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"48041","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove version 12 from actively supported versions","State":"closed","Body":"Version 12 is no longer in LTS.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48041","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: remove version 12 from actively supported versions\" (#48041)"},{"Id":"1448520154","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-14T19:27:23","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"48051","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(common): export the IMAGE_CONFIG token","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In addition I am attaching files from my application \r\n   - package.json\r\n   - angular.json\r\n   - tsconfig.json\r\n   - extra-webpack.config.js\r\n   \r\nSo my application and the other library from the company are using same angular version.\r\nWhen they build the project and upload they don't get this JIT compilation time error.\r\nBut when I use their library I am getting this error after I build my application and I upload on production.\r\nLocally the ng build is passing and don't give me any errors, so it happens only when I upload the build.\r\n\r\n[files.zip](https://github.com/angular/angular/files/9989687/files.zip)\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nJIT compilation failed for directive class t{constructor(t,e){this.elementRef=t,this.renderer=e,this.element=this.elementRef.nativeElement}ngOnChanges(){this._canHighlight&&this._highlightLabel()}ngAfterViewInit(){this.label=this.element.inne…\r\n\r\nUncaught Error: The directive 't' needs to be compiled using the JIT compiler, but '@angular/compiler' is not available.\r\n\r\nThe directive is part of a library that has been partially compiled.\r\nHowever, the Angular Linker has not processed the library such that JIT compilation is used as fallback.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the library is processed using the Angular Linker to become fully AOT compiled.\r\nAlternatively, the JIT compiler should be loaded by bootstrapping using '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic' or '@angular/platform-server',\r\nor manually provide the compiler with 'import \"@angular/compiler\";' before bootstrapping.\r\n    at yi (core.umd.js:4382:19)\r\n    at t.ɵɵngDeclareFactory (core.umd.js:33949:24)\r\n    at ng-select-ng-option-highlight.mjs:44:35\r\n    at 0mKc (ng-select-ng-option-highlight.mjs:45:249)\r\n    at l (bootstrap:79:22)\r\n    at 3jgy (ngx-virtual-scroller.js:1242:15)\r\n    at l (bootstrap:79:22)\r\n    at Object.RiVO (portal.service.ts:6:27)\r\n    at l (bootstrap:79:22)\r\n    at Module.zUnb (app-routing.module.ts:59:15)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 10.2.1\r\nNode: 14.15.5\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\nIvy Workspace:\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1002.1 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         10.2.1 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   10.2.1 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          10.2.1 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/update           0.1002.1 (cli-only)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48031","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular linker is not working\" (#48031)"},{"Id":"1445350915","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T11:38:13","Actor":"vbraun","Number":"48032","RawContent":null,"Title":"rxjs subscription leak in DowngradeComponentAdapter.subscribeToOutput","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nDestroying a downgraded component with `@Output` leaks a rxjs subscription\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n* You need an Angular component with an `@Output`\r\n* Downgrade to use it in an AngularJS component\r\n* Create & destroy the downgraded component, e.g. by routing to a page that contains it and then routing away\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/upgrade/src/common/src/downgrade_component_adapter.ts:\r\n```ts\r\n  private subscribeToOutput(output: PropertyBinding, expr: string, isAssignment: boolean = false) {\r\n    const getter = this.$parse(expr);\r\n    const setter = getter.assign;\r\n    if (isAssignment && !setter) {\r\n      throw new Error(`Expression '${expr}' is not assignable!`);\r\n    }\r\n    const emitter = this.component[output.prop] as EventEmitter<any>;\r\n    if (emitter) {\r\n      emitter.subscribe({                            <------------- this subscription is never unsubscribed from \r\n        next: isAssignment ?

change is scoped only to the plugin\n`zone.js/plugins/task-tracking`. If you used `TaskTrackingZoneSpec` and\nchecked the pending macroTasks e.g. using `(this.ngZone as any)._inner ._parent._properties.TaskTrackingZone.getTasksFor('macroTask')`, then\nits behavior slightly changed for periodic macrotasks. For example,\npreviously the `setInterval` macrotask was no longer tracked after its\ncallback was executed for the first time. Now it's tracked until\nthe task is explicitly cancelled, e.g with `clearInterval(id)`.\n\n#### [0.11.5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.4...zone.js-0.11.5) (2022-03-03)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** async-test should only call done once ([#&#8203;45025](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45025)) ([dea7234](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/dea7234a76f652c8e9d9b79719e2b170a5a50777))\n-   **zone.js:** defineProperties should also set symbol props ([#&#8203;45098](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45098)) ([b437d12](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/b437d1238d9006baa0cf749adbd7cc3270de3040)), closes [#&#8203;44095](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/44095)\n-   **zone.js:** fix several test cases which trigger `done()` multiple times ([#&#8203;45025](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45025)) ([d5565cc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d5565ccdb4573a47eb329b09c6852c1ae39672a6))\n-   **zone.js:** only one listener should also re-throw an error correctly ([#&#8203;41868](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41868)) ([299f92c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/299f92c3b62a43c94cff4a204f9e41c46a159efc)), closes [#&#8203;41867](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41867) [/github.com/angular/angular/pull/41562#issuecomment-822696973](https://togithub.com//github.com/angular/angular/pull/41562/issues/issuecomment-822696973)\n-   **zone.js:** patch global instead of Mocha object ([#&#8203;45047](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45047)) ([8efbdb5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8efbdb57c11a6c632f69d7e142a632b6a853fa46)), closes [#&#8203;42834](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/42834)\n-   **zone.js:** should continue to executue listeners when throw error ([#&#8203;41562](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41562)) ([008eaf3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/008eaf3b7df90b2cdd9c83e229d23d4014d6dbc9)), closes [#&#8203;41522](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41522)\n-   **zone.js:** update several flaky cases ([#&#8203;41526](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41526)) ([25a83eb](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/25a83eb264aa19fc4616cea45e04d790b9bcd777)), closes [#&#8203;41434](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/41434)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **zone.js:** add Promise.any() implementation ([#&#8203;45064](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45064)) ([4d494d2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4d494d24ccb69b40a477b0bccd97baf6af66accf)), closes [#&#8203;44393](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/44393)\n-   **zone.js:** update electron patch to support electron/remote 14 ([#&#8203;45073](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/45073)) ([d65706a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d65706a3b225ccb88d719478c19a379aef1b6047)), closes [#&#8203;43346](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/43346)\n\n#### [0.11.4](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.3...zone.js-0.11.4) (2021-02-10)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** fesm2015 bundle should also be strict module.

This behavior used to hide real errors,\nso the logic is now updated to trigger original errors (if any). One exception\nwhere the patch remains in place is `document.registerElement`\n(to allow smooth transition for code/polyfills that rely on old behavior in legacy browsers).\nIf your code relies on the old behavior (where errors were not thrown before),\nyou may need to update the logic to handle the errors that are no longer masked by ZoneJS patch.\n\n#### [0.11.1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.0...zone.js-0.11.1) (2020-08-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **zone.js:** zone.js package.json should not include files/directories field ([#&#8203;38528](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38528)) ([6b662d1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6b662d1)), closes [#&#8203;38526](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38526) [#&#8203;38516](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38516) [#&#8203;38513](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38513)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This was added in v17 to support SSR without relying on an infinite `setTimeout` with ZoneJS like it did pre-v17. Prior to version 17, this was also only done on the server and did not affect clients or unit tests.\r\n\r\nToday, `PendingTasks` contribute to `ApplicationRef.isStable` but do not contribute to the stability of `ComponentFixture`. This divergence in stability behavior was not intended and we plan to make these two stability indicators the same again, like they were when it was solely based on the state of the Zone.\r\n\r\nBy aligning the two behaviors again, this would include all pending tasks in the stability of fixtures. After investigation, this seems likely to be a pretty large breaking change. Tests appear to quite often use `await fixture.whenStable` when there are unfinished requests that have not been mocked or flushed.\r\n\r\nThis change prevents request in `HttpClient` from contributing to stability through the `PendingTasks` automatically but only when using `HttpClientTesting`. In this scenario, requests need to be expected and flushed manually for them to resolve.

It's a very long time for me to find what's wrong. I thought it was likely due to the fact that the cartService is being accessed before it's initialized in CartComponent. The constructor is called before the instance variables are initialized. Therefore, when trying to access this.cartService.getItems() in the initialization of items, cartService is still undefined.\r\nSo, I changed the code to:\r\nexport class CartComponent {\r\n  items: Product[];\r\n\r\n  constructor(private cartService: CartService) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.items = this.cartService.getItems();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt finally works.\r\n\r\nSo, I hope you can check the tutorial again to avoid similar problems for fresh learner like me.

been removed.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   deprecated `platformDynamicServer` has been removed. Add an `import @&#8203;angular/compiler` and replace the usage with `platformServer`\n-   deprecated `ServerTransferStateModule` has been removed. `TransferState` can be use without providing this module.\n-   deprecated `useAbsoluteUrl` and `baseUrl` been removed from `PlatformConfig`. Provide and absolute `url` instead.\n-   Legacy handling or Node.js URL parsing has been removed from `ServerPlatformLocation`.\n\n    The main differences are;\n\n    -   `pathname` is always suffixed with a `/`.\n    -   `port` is empty when `http:` protocol and port in url is `80`\n    -   `port` is empty when `https:` protocol and port in url is `443`\n\n##### router\n\n-   This change allows `Route.redirectTo` to be a function\n    in addition to the previous string. Code which expects `redirectTo` to\n    only be a string on `Route` objects will need to be adjusted.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [879bd80b57](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/879bd80b571368bdc6e65c5415d98ad0f546267a) | fix | capture data bindings for content projection purposes in blocks ([#&#8203;54876](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54876)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [6aff144232](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6aff14423238f8995da8104e60c0baca26df2020) | fix | symbol feature detection for the compiler ([#&#8203;54711](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54711)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [314112de99](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/314112de99bb97475a0d8bdbddf84a3b3ce4a8fb) | fix | Prevent `markForCheck` during change detection from causing infinite loops ([#&#8203;54900](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54900)) |\n\n##### platform-browser-dynamic\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [eb20c1a8b1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/eb20c1a8b18e2e080c856e3e1bf7bcd02f3bfd28) | refactor | unused `RESOURCE_CACHE_PROVIDER` API has been removed ([#&#8203;54875](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54875)) |\n\n##### platform-server\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [07ac017731](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/07ac017731f0e08ea3736f1f212093a28648a304) | refactor | remove deprecated `platformDynamicServer` API ([#&#8203;54874](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54874)) |\n| [e8b588d8b7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/e8b588d8b7fc014aaef99d4b0c1e4567b4aa195d) | refactor | remove deprecated `ServerTransferStateModule` API ([#&#8203;54874](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54874)) |\n| [3b1967ca64](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3b1967ca64479df9137b3ad7a0d04dbaff6496f4) | refactor | remove deprecated `useAbsoluteUrl` and `baseUrl` from `PlatformConfig` ([#&#8203;54874](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54874)) |\n| [2357d3566c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2357d3566c4d18dc40cbda6644ed459ef7703893) | refactor | remove legacy URL handling logic ([#&#8203;54874](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54874)) |\n\n##### router\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [2b802587f2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2b802587f27186baa493c1dd01f42d568b652f38) | feat | Allow Route.redirectTo to be a function which returns a string or UrlTree ([#&#8203;52606](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52606)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components (@&#8203;angular/cdk)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.0-next.1`](https://togithub.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1800-next1-basalt-solitude-2024-03-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/components/compare/18.0.0-next.0...18.0.0-next.1)\n\n##### cdk\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [9343131450](https://togithub.com/angular/components/commit/93431314507b11ce8191a632547eee9f2a288775) | fix | **drag-drop:** optionally inject parent drag in preview and placeholder ([#&#8203;28750](https://togithub.com/angular/components/pull/28750)) |\n| [108cce33bf](https://togithub.com/angular/components/commit/108cce33bfb331fcdce18527480b3a89f5f81a28) | fix | **overlay:** Remove use of zone onStable to detach content ([#&#8203;28740](https://togithub.com/angular/components/pull/28740)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

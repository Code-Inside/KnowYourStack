The temporary variable needs to be declared in a separate\r\nstatement and this would also cause the full expression itself to be pulled out\r\ninto a separate statement. This would compile into the following\r\npseudo-code instructions:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar temp = null;\r\nvar firstName = (temp = pipe('async', ctx.person$)) == null ? null : temp.name;\r\nproperty('enabled', ctx.enabled)('firstName', firstName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the pipe evaluation happens before evaluating the `enabled` binding,\r\nsuch that the runtime's internal binding index would correspond with `enabled`,\r\nnot `firstName`. This introduces a problem when the pipe uses `WrappedValue` to\r\nforce a change to be detected, as the runtime would then mark the binding slot\r\ncorresponding with `enabled` as dirty, instead of `firstName`. This results\r\nin the `enabled` binding to be updated, triggering setters and affecting how\r\n`OnChanges` is called.\r\n\r\nIn the pseudo-code above, the intermediate `firstName` variable is not strictly\r\nnecessary---it only improved readability a bit---and emitting it inline with\r\nthe binding itself avoids the out-of-order execution of the pipe:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar temp = null;\r\nproperty('enabled', ctx.enabled)\r\n  ('firstName', (temp = pipe('async', ctx.person$)) == null ? null : temp.name);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a new `BindingForm` that results in the above code to be\r\ngenerated and adds compiler and acceptance tests to verify the proper behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #37194","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37911","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): evaluate safe navigation expressions in correct bindin‚Ä¶\" (#37911)"},{"Id":"650680836","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-03T16:11:36","Actor":"Mani2693","Number":"37910","RawContent":null,"Title":"Please provide meaningful error message \" ERROR in Cannot read property 'isSkipSelf' of null \"","State":"open","Body":"How to trace \" ERROR in Cannot read property 'isSkipSelf' of null \" ? \r\n\r\nThere is lot of possible fix for above error , Our project is huge we are getting this error and it is nearly impossible to trace back all the potential cause for this issue. \r\n\r\nError occurs only in production mode ( with --aot and --prod ) \r\n\r\nWe tried \"--verbose\" which still not giving us any stack trace \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11607412/86485168-a37e2d00-bd75-11ea-98c3-8e7203539cc1.png)\r\n\r\nAngular version: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11607412/86485204-babd1a80-bd75-11ea-9ba2-93c02779e905.png)\r\n\r\ntsconfig: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11607412/86485264-f48e2100-bd75-11ea-8f7c-583e45050f56.png)\r\n\r\nPlease help us to trace the root cause of this error \r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37910","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Please provide meaningful error message \" ERROR in Cannot read property 'isSkipSelf' of null \"\" (#37910)"},{"Id":"650640889","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-03T14:46:42","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"37909","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(localize): expose `canParse()` diagnostics","State":"open","Body":"When loading a translation file we ask each `TranslationParser`\r\nwhether it can parse the file.

Bundle size - if I'm creating a library or installing a library containing a module with 10 components, I want to use one of those components in my app, but I only want to use one of them, I add the module to my imports array and my bundle will contain 9 components I'm not even using.\r\n2. Maybe this is why angular material wraps almost every component in the library in it's own module, a bit ugly in my opinion but necessary because of the NgModule system, still it requires me adding tons of stuff to my imports library. \r\n3. I know how to solve 2 I will just create CommonModule with the imports in one module and then every module that use them will add that module to the imports, but isn't that pattern messing my bundle size as well? \r\nFor example let's say I have common stuff that every module is using and than a bunch of lazy loaded module that each we can divide to a group that use the common ones and another group of other common modules, I don't want to add everything to to CommonModule so I would have do to Common1Module, Common2Module, etc. for every group cause if I throw everything on the CommonModule it will effect the bundle size of every lazy loaded part of my app won't it? \r\n4. It's not a reason but it's a big clue that the NgModule system is not needed, there is no module system in any other frontend framework or library that i'm aware of, including React and Vue, they simply use the module system in JS. \r\n5. Learning curve - While it's pretty easy for people to learn that they need modules, separation of concerns is a pretty well understood concept for people and they know they should split their code to \"libraries\", so the angular module system is pretty simple to understand, but usually when I teach and talk to angular developers they get lost how the DI works cause the module system heavily intertwined in how the DI is searching for providers.\r\n6. HttpClientModule is a good example here, let's say I'm creating a library which contain an NgModule. Obviously that module can be added to the imports of a lazy loaded module, I cannot add HttpClientModule to my library cause it can create another instance of HttpClient if it is used, and then I can mess up my interceptor. So now I have to worry about peerDependencies as well. Example ngrx libraries require us to add HttpClientModule. We already have a peerDependency mechanism inside javascript modules, now we have to do the same with angular\r\n\r\nCurrently I see the Ivy renderer allows us to create components without modules, but it is still heavily limited in what the component can use in terms of other directives and providers, without a module that is wrapped and supplies them. \r\n\r\nIt somewhat seemed to me that the NgModules system is something that was taken from the Angular.js ecosystem and just moved along to the current Angular and I don't think it's needed at all, and not only that it creates more harm than good.\r\n\r\nI think the NgModule requires a drastic change which will have to cause a drastic change in the DI, and we will not achieve the bundle size of the competitors React and Vue unless a major change here is achieved . \r\nI think NgModule has more cons than pros and would love to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nMaking a really general proposal from this post these are the changes I think should be made:\r\n1. The DI system should not automatically create different trees for modules and for the view, rather it should be a simple solution that should be inspired from the library TypeDI. \r\nYou import the DI and you register services to it, and if you want to create a tree structure in your DI you do it manually, you import the DI system and fork it so a certain component can have it's own dependencies. \r\nOr at least to support backward compatibility allow the DI to work in manual mode, just like we did with the change detection strategy. The manual mode of the DI will enable the developer to control the forking of the di to trees and thus he can choose to work in a non NgModule mode.\r\n2. After that remove the modules entirely, every component that use a certain directive component should use the js module system and use a certain import.\r\nMaybe this step can also somehow be integrated in the compiler in some way so based on the selector angular will know which component to integrate without using the js module system. I'm not entirely strong on the compilation process so I don't think I'm qualified to make a suggestion here.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37904","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The entire use of NgModule should be deprecated\" (#37904)"},{"Id":"650421523","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-03T09:19:08","Actor":"JonWallsten","Number":"37903","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dependency compiled to ES5 during build process even though target is ES2015 and ngcc is run on postinstall","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] build\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nNot that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nOur CI (Jenkins) gets stuck in the build process after upgrading to Angular 10.

A warning about parallel builds is shown for all apps but the one, and those apps never exists the process even though the build is complete. \r\nSo the ngcc part is somehow causing the process to never finish. The main issue causing this I just discovered in the logs.

It is also not being imported anywhere else in the project. As the `console.log` message in the `foo.ts` file states, I do not expect that line to print at run time. I do not expect that line to print because TypeScript says that type-only imports \"always gets fully erased, so there‚Äôs no remnant of it at runtime\". The actual behavior does not match my expected behavior because the `console.log` message is being printed at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-54e8de)\r\nor\r\n[GitHub repo](https://github.com/samherrmann/angular-sandbox/commit/9c77f6a57b2c7d2bc036700d0df278232ef0a314)\r\n\r\nObserve the console.\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.0\r\nNode: 12.15.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.0\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.5\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37900","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Injector does not respect TypeScript type-only imports\" (#37900)"},{"Id":"650258955","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-02T23:50:30","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"37899","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): upgrade lighthouse to 6.1.0","State":"open","Body":"To take advantage of lazy loaded images `img[loading=lazy]`, this commit\r\nupgrades lighthouse to version 6.1.0.\r\n\r\nCloses #35965\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In reality, `ViewRef`\r\nshould not be injectable, as explicitly noted in https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/c00f4ab2ae703e8a3ee4a3850170c9bbf0f9bc42.\r\n\r\nThere seems no way to simulate the proper prototype chain in such browsers\r\nthat do not natively support `__proto__`, so TypeScript and `core-js` polyfills\r\nsimply break the prototype chain and assign inherited properties directly\r\non `ViewRef`. i.e. so that `ViewRef.__NG_ELEMENT_ID__` exists and DI picks it up.\r\n\r\nThere is a way for TypeScript to theoretically generate proper prototype chain in\r\nES5 output, but they intend to only bother about the proper prototype chain in ES6\r\nwhere `setPrototypeOf` etc. are officially standardized.

Afer upgrading to >=NG9.0.7 the compiler gets stripped away in production mode by optimization. This is an issue since it breaks any app depending on runtime compilation.\r\n\r\nThe possible solutions presented in the error are pretty \"weird\":\r\n\r\n1. \"JIT compilation is discouraged for production use-cases!

These docs are available in the [`new-docs`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/new-docs/puppeteer.md) directory on GitHub. These aren't ready for use just yet but we're making great progress. You can track this work in [#&#8203;6118](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6118). \n\n-   We've continued improving our TypeScript definitions. Our tests are now migrated to TypeScript ([#&#8203;5830](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5830)) so that we're consuming our own API. Work continues to ship built-in type definitions in a future version. You can track this work in [#&#8203;6124](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6124).\n\n-   We've started restructuring Puppeteer to work towards being able to better support an environment agnostic Puppeteer module. You can track this work in [#&#8203;6125](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6125).  \n\n#### Raw notes\n\n[`85d8dbf`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/85d8dbf) - chore: mark v5.0.0\n[`29f7e16`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/29f7e16) - chore(docs): reduce warnings when generating docs ([#&#8203;6138](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6138))\n[`221d172`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/221d172) - chore: add typecheck command ([#&#8203;6140](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6140))\n[`6474edb`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/6474edb) - feat(types): add types for `$eval` ([#&#8203;6135](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6135))\n[`8370ec8`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/8370ec8) - feat(types): add (and fix) `evaluateHandle` types ([#&#8203;6130](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6130))\n[`3c0dc45`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/3c0dc45) - chore: update Windows skipped tests.

(I am using **ng update**)\r\n\r\nThe first project was upgraded successfully by upgrading to the latest Angular 8 version first, then upgrading to Angular 9 and then to Angular 10.\r\nThe upgrade of the second project however seemed incomplete, because not all of the same migrations were executed as for the first one.\r\n\r\nI am aware of this https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18027, however I have not received any errors and I updated the project step by step without skipping major versions.\r\n\r\n### Update log\r\n\r\nAfter executing ng update @angular/core @angular/cli, the following output was present:\r\n```\r\nThe installed local Angular CLI version is older than the latest stable version.\r\nInstalling a temporary version to perform the update.\r\nInstalling packages for tooling via npm.\r\nInstalled packages for tooling via npm.\r\nUsing package manager: 'npm'\r\nCollecting installed dependencies...\r\nFound 44 dependencies.\r\nFetching dependency metadata from registry...\r\n                      Package \"@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"tsickle\" (requires \"~0.38.0\", would install \"0.39.0\")\r\n                       Package \"@angular/cdk\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"tslib\" (requires \"^1.9.0\", would install \"2.0.0\").\r\n                       Package \"tsickle\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"typescript\" (requires \"~3.8.2\", would install \"3.9.6\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince tsickle does not have typescript 3.9.x as a peer dependency yet (should be resolved by this issue I guess: https://github.com/angular/tsickle/pull/1161 ), I ignored that warning. I ignored the angular/cdk warning as well, because upgrading the angular/material package (after the core and cli packages) should update the cdk to version 10 as well. Eventually I executed the ng update with the **--force** flag.\r\n\r\nThis is the final output, in which you will notice that only the package.json file is updated and the additional migrations to the tsconfig.json, tsconfig.lib.prod.json and the creation of the tsconfig.base.json are missing, but no error is thrown.\r\n\r\n```\r\nng update @angular/core @angular/cli --force\r\nThe installed local Angular CLI version is older than the latest stable version.\r\nInstalling a temporary version to perform the update.\r\nInstalling packages for tooling via npm.\r\nInstalled packages for tooling via npm.\r\nUsing package manager: 'npm'\r\nCollecting installed dependencies...\r\nFound 44 dependencies.\r\nFetching dependency metadata from registry...\r\n                      Package \"@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"tsickle\" (requires \"~0.38.0\", would install \"0.39.0\")\r\n                       Package \"@angular/cdk\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"tslib\" (requires \"^1.9.0\", would install \"2.0.0\").\r\n                       Package \"tsickle\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"typescript\" (requires \"~3.8.2\", would install \"3.9.6\")\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/cli @ \"10.0.1\" (was \"9.1.10\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/core @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr @ \"0.1000.1\" (was \"0.901.10\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency ng-packagr @ \"10.0.0\" (was \"9.1.5\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/language-service @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/compiler-cli @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/common @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/animations @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/elements @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/platform-browser @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/platform-browser-dynamic @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/compiler @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/forms @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency tslib @ \"2.0.0\" (was \"1.10.0\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/router @ \"10.0.2\" (was \"9.1.11\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular-devkit/build-angular @ \"0.1000.1\" (was \"0.901.10\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency typescript @ \"3.9.6\" (was \"3.8.3\")...\r\nUPDATE package.json (2870 bytes)\r\n‚úî Packages installed successfully.\r\n** Executing migrations of package '@angular/core' **\r\n\r\n‚ùØ Missing @Injectable and incomplete provider definition migration.\r\n  As of Angular 9, enforcement of @Injectable decorators for DI is a bit stricter and incomplete provider definitions behave differently.\r\n  Read more about this here: https://v9.angular.io/guide/migration-injectable\r\n  Migration completed.\r\n\r\n‚ùØ ModuleWithProviders migration.\r\n  As of Angular 10, the ModuleWithProviders type requires a generic.\r\n  This migration adds the generic where it is missing.\r\n  Read more about this here: https://v10.angular.io/guide/migration-module-with-providers\r\n  Migration completed.\r\n\r\n‚ùØ Undecorated classes with Angular features migration.\r\n  In version 10, classes that use Angular features and do not have an Angular decorator are no longer supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\nThe end result is a very short upgrade log and it seems not everything was migrated, which includes the missing tsconfig.base.json. What could be the reason for that and is it essential for all Angular 10+ projects to have the new structure, that these tsconfig migrations provide? **The project builds and runs successfully though.**","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"tsconfig.base.json does not exist after upgrade to Angular 10 (no error)\" (#18130)"},{"Id":"650342604","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-03T04:55:53","Actor":"SathishKumarRajendran","Number":"18125","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot call a class as a function","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWhile serving the sample getting console error in angular 10\r\n\r\n### Error Screen shot\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53341125/86424762-008bcb80-bd01-11ea-93d2-86cb4a48463b.png)\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nIts working fine in angular 9\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps\r\n\r\n**Sample:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SathishKumarRajendran/AngularSampleIssue\r\n\r\n- npm i\r\n- npm run start\r\n\r\n**note:** If you get error like below image error while serving, Please install latest typescript and replace in the node_modules to resolve that issue.

Of course it will be enabled only for dark themes.\r\n\r\nWhy this feature request ? Because some components like `mat-expansion-panel` are very hard to distinct inside a `mat-card` because they have the same background color.

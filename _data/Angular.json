Upgrade to unstable versions only if the existing version is unstable\n  - Raise PRs immediately (after branch is created)\n  - If semantic commits detected, use semantic commit type <code>fix</code> for dependencies and <code>chore</code> for all others\n  - Keep existing branches updated even when not scheduled\n  - Disable automerging feature - wait for humans to merge all PRs\n  - Ignore `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `vendor` and various test/tests directories\n  - Update existing lock files only when <code>package.json</code> is modified\n  - Autodetect whether to pin dependencies or maintain ranges\n  - Rate limit PR creation to a maximum of two per hour\n  - Limit to maximum 20 open PRs at any time\n  - Group known monorepo packages together\n  - Use curated list of recommended non-monorepo package groupings\n\n:abcd: Would you like to change the way Renovate is upgrading your dependencies?

The use case is: we have micro-frontend apps which are destroyed via `NgModuleRef.destroy()`.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1) `git clone git@github.com:arturovt/ngmoduleref-destroy-issue.git`\r\n2) `cd ngmoduleref-destroy-issue`\r\n3) `yarn`\r\n4) Start dev server `yarn ng s`\r\n5) Go to `http://localhost:4200`, open dev tools, click the \"Destroy\" button. Notice logs in the console and that component is removed from DOM\r\n6) Stop dev server, go to `tsconfig.json` and set `enableIvy` to `true`\r\n7) Start dev server again, click the \"Destroy\" button. Notice logs in the console and that component is NOT removed from DOM\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.0\r\nNode: 10.18.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

First one is the webpack compilation and second is the post processing. Because of that after first phase output files land in `/tmp` directory instead of target destination. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, that I've been using a `sentry` plugin that relies on webpack hook - `afterEmit`. Previously that hook allowed the plugin to read target (ex. `dist`) directory and access emitted files. Right now at the time when hook is executed `dist` directory remains empty until post-processing is completed.  \r\n\r\nOf course I could (and I will) write custom node script that will be executed manually (or as a combined npm script) just after `ng build`. \r\n\r\nAre there plans to put that post processing back to webpack compilation process, or it's going to stay this way? \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need a reproduction.

(There's also some unwanted\r\nwhitespace in the textContent).\r\n\r\nReplace undefined with an empty array, and the textContent with just\r\nthe actual chip text, which in the case of row chips corresponds to the\r\ntext that the user entered.\r\n\r\nThese unintuitive values are the same as the old non-mdc\r\nmat-chip-listbox. But due to the way the old listbox implemented\r\nControlValueAccessor, chips being used as a chip grid didn't actually\r\never call the onChange handler to update the FormControl value, so their\r\nvalues were basically ignored.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/19006","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material-experimental/mdc-chips) Replace default values\" (#19006)"},{"Id":"593649760","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T22:50:24","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"18985","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add try/catch to @angular/bazel ng_module patch","State":"closed","Body":"Navigating the angular/angular & angular/components dependency sandwich.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18985","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add try/catch to @angular/bazel ng_module patch\" (#18985)"},{"Id":"594301101","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T22:50:03","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"18994","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(deps-dev): bump minimist from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps [minimist](https://github.com/substack/minimist) from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/substack/minimist/commit/6457d7440a47f329c12c4a5abfbce211c4235b93\"><code>6457d74</code></a> 1.2.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/substack/minimist/commit/38a4d1caead72ef99e824bb420a2528eec03d9ab\"><code>38a4d1c</code></a> even more aggressive checks for protocol pollution</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/substack/minimist/commit/13c01a5327736903704984b7f65616b8476850cc\"><code>13c01a5</code></a> more failing proto pollution tests</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/substack/minimist/compare/1.2.2...1.2.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=minimist&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=1.2.2&new-version=1.2.3)](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-automated-security-fixes)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

[Here's the stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ixqfux) that demonstrates the problem. I've painted the placeholder element into green. \r\n\r\n**I've done a lot of debugging to figure out the cause of the problem and I'll describe my findings below.**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Configure component view to use both drag-and-drop and virtual scrolling\r\n\r\n```\r\n<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport class=\"virtual-scroll-container\" itemSize=\"30\" minBufferPx=\"60\" maxBufferPx=\"90\">\r\n  <div cdkDropList>\r\n    <div class=\"list-item\" *cdkVirtualFor=\"let item of dataSource\" cdkDrag [attr.id]=\"item.id\">{{item.id}}</div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.  Star dragging an element down.\r\n \r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nA draggable item is always rendered where I keep a mouse pointer.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAs new elements are being rendered to the DOM, the draggable item loses its position and either disappears or starts jumping in the list.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 9.0.5\r\n- CDK/Material: 9.2.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n\r\n### Demo of the problem:\r\n\r\n![2020-04-06_14-50-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6124091/78556550-d6b52c80-7817-11ea-82da-50c0caa4f7b9.gif)\r\n\r\n### My investigation\r\n\r\nThe cause of the problem seems to be the new items that are being rendered. Once an item is added to the DOM, the `CdkDrag` directive attached to it [registers itself within a drop list container](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/d1a6ea74db0881001bf02ff113f269552effc4f6/src/cdk/drag-drop/directives/drop-list.ts#L197). This in turn leads to the `withItems` method being triggered on the drop container list:\r\n\r\n![image (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6124091/78557328-3eb84280-7819-11ea-82ed-738bfeb860e4.png)\r\n\r\nAs the callstack unfolds, the [cacheItemPositions](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/531ea7cc5b2a6c13daac59c3b33f00ff1147efe7/src/cdk/drag-drop/drop-list-ref.ts#L606) method is called. The problem is that inside this method all current item positions (offsets) are reset to 0. If you add a logging to the method before and after `this._this._itemPositions` are updated:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis._itemPositions.forEach(item => console.log('Element ID:', item.drag.data.element.nativeElement.id, 'offset:', item.offset));\r\n```\r\nthis is what the console shows:\r\n\r\n![2020-04-06_14-58-16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6124091/78557564-aec6c880-7819-11ea-92fe-3ecfe98d7bc3.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis leads to a placeholder element lose current position and start jumping in the list.\r\n\r\n**I'm happy to make a PR to fix it, if I get guidance on the best way to address this problem.**","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19003","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(drag-drop + virtual scroll): Draggable item loses its position when new list item is rendered in the DOM as a result of virtual scrolling\" (#19003)"},{"Id":"595015760","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T10:59:36","Actor":"joaqcid","Number":"19002","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatButtonHarness): Button events not triggering on Protractor environemnt","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\nMatButtonHarness is not working on Protractor environment, the following code reproduce the error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst loader = ProtractorHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);\r\nconst button = await loader.getHarness(MatButtonHarness);\r\nawait button.click();\r\n``` \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen executing `button.click()` the event should execute. \r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen executing `button.click()` the event is not executing.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.7\r\nNode: 10.17.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.7\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.0\r\n@angular/material                 9.2.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19002","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatButtonHarness): Button events not triggering on Protractor environemnt\" (#19002)"},{"Id":"594782694","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T03:49:43","Actor":"Achilles1515","Number":"19001","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(drag-drop): `Point` interface is not exported in the public API","State":"open","Body":"#### Issue\r\nThe `Point` interface:\r\n```ts\r\n/** Point on the page or within an element. */\r\nexport interface Point {\r\n  x: number;\r\n  y: number;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis defined and exported inside [drag-ref.ts](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts).

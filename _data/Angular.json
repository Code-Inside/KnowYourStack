(then it shouldn't be a GET request 😉) )\r\n  - B.3. emit cached response + new request (e.g. in SSG cases, we might want to fetch fresh data in case SSG-ed is not up-to-date).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIMO, not all of these use cases should be handled by Angular's hydration's HTTP cache transfer.\r\n\r\nAllowing per-request opt-out would be enough to let developers customize the behavior for unconventional requests using `TransferState`.\r\n\r\nThis could be done globally using a feature:\r\n```ts\r\nprovideClientHydration(withHttpTransferCache({filter: req => !req.url.startsWith('https://internal')}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nand per request\r\n```ts\r\nhttp.get('/my-ip-address', {cacheTransfer: false}); // we'll have to figure out a better naming for this\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nDisable the feature using `withNoHttpTransferCache()` and implement our own transfer logic like before using `TransferState`.\r\n\r\nRight now, we can easily mimic the current behavior which is here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/47c093a7391e550bfb01cff57a6fc712f3342d14/packages/common/http/src/transfer_cache.ts#L35-L90\r\n\r\nThe modularity of the current design (thanks to the `TransferState` primitive) and the workaround described here is sufficient enough to reduce the priority of this issue drastically...\r\n\r\n👉 ... making it an interesting opportunity for a community initiative 😉😉 👈","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow customization of Hydration's HTTP Cache Transfer \" (#50117)"},{"Id":"1693180479","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-02T22:34:26","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50116","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove unused deps","State":"open","Body":"* All `@types` package removed have typings in their package.\r\n* brotli is unused\r\n* tmp is unused\r\n* vlq is unused\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50116","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: remove unused deps\" (#50116)"},{"Id":"1693104476","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-02T21:08:21","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"50115","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(elements): remove deps webcomponents/custom-elements.","State":"open","Body":"`webcomponents/custom-elements` is unnecessary now that we support only evergreen browsers.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/50115","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(elements): remove deps webcomponents/custom-elements.\" (#50115)"},{"Id":"1692867023","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-02T18:06:16","Actor":"Lorti","Number":"50113","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add missing navigation item","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Use `schematicCollections` instead.\n\n    Before\n\n    ```json\n    \"defaultCollection\": \"@&#8203;angular/material\"\n    ```\n\n    After\n\n    ```json\n    \"schematicCollections\": [\"@&#8203;angular/material\"]\n    ```\n\n-   The deprecated `defaultProject` workspace option has been removed. The project to use will be determined from the current working directory.\n\n-   Node.js v14 support has been removed\n\n    Node.js v14 is planned to be End-of-Life on 2023-04-30. Angular will stop supporting Node.js v14 in Angular v16.\n    Angular v16 will continue to officially support Node.js versions v16 and v18.\n\n##### [@&#8203;schematics/angular](https://togithub.com/schematics/angular)\n\n-   `ng g resolver` and `ng g guard` now generate a functional resolver or guard by default. It is still possible to generate a (deprecated) class-based resolver or guard by using `ng g resolver --no-functional` or `ng g guard --no-functional`.\n-   The CLI no longer allows to generate `CanLoad` guards. Use `CanMatch` instead.\n\n###\n\n-   -   TypeScript 4.8 is no longer supported.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/build-angular](https://togithub.com/angular-devkit/build-angular)\n\n-   Deprecated `outputPath` and `outputPaths` from the server and browser builder have been removed from the builder output. Use `outputs` instead.\n\n    Note: this change does not effect application developers.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/core](https://togithub.com/angular-devkit/core)\n\n-   Several changes to the `SchemaRegistry`.\n    -   `compile` method now returns a `Promise`.\n    -   Deprecated `flatten` has been removed without replacement.\n-   -   `ContentHasMutatedException`, `InvalidUpdateRecordException`, `UnimplementedException` and `MergeConflictException` API from `@angular-devkit/core` have been removed in favor of the API from `@angular-devkit/schematics`.\n    -   `UnsupportedPlatformException` - A custom error exception should be created instead.\n\n##### [@&#8203;angular-devkit/schematics](https://togithub.com/angular-devkit/schematics)\n\n-   The depracated `UpdateBuffer` has been removed and `UpdateBuffer2`\n    is renamed to `UpdateBuffer`. With this change the related and\n    deprecated symbols `ContentCannotBeRemovedException` and `Chunk`\n    have also been removed.\n\n##### [@&#8203;ngtools/webpack](https://togithub.com/ngtools/webpack)\n\n-   NGCC integration has been removed and as a result Angular View Engine libraries will no longer work.\n\n#####

-->\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/angular</summary>\n\n### [`v16.0.0`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1600-2023-05-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/15.2.9...16.0.0)\n\n[Blog post \"Angular v16 is now available\"](http://goo.gle/angular-v16).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n#####\n\n-   Angular Compatibility Compiler (ngcc) has been removed and as a result Angular View Engine libraries will no longer work\n-   Deprecated `EventManager` method `addGlobalEventListener` has been removed as it is not used by Ivy.\n\n##### bazel\n\n-   Several changes to the Angular Package Format (APF)\n    -   Removal of FESM2015\n    -   Replacing ES2020 with ES2022\n    -   Replacing FESM2020 with FESM2022\n-   Several changes to the Angular Package Format (APF)\n    -   Removal of FESM2015\n    -   Replacing ES2020 with ES2022\n    -   Replacing FESM2020 with FESM2022\n\n##### common\n\n-   `MockPlatformLocation` is now provided by default in tests.\n    Existing tests may have behaviors which rely on\n    `BrowserPlatformLocation` instead. For example, direct access to the\n    `window.history` in either the test or the component rather than going\n    through the Angular APIs (`Location.getState()`). The quickest fix is to\n    update the providers in the test suite to override the provider again\n    `TestBed.configureTestingModule({providers: [{provide: PlatformLocation, useClass: BrowserPlatformLocation}]})`.\n    The ideal fix would be to update the code to instead be compatible with\n    `MockPlatformLocation` instead.\n-   If the 'ngTemplateOutletContext' is different from the context, it will result in a compile-time error.\n\nBefore the change, the following template was compiling:\n\n```typescript\ninterface MyContext {\n  $implicit: string;\n}\n\n@&#8203;Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [NgTemplateOutlet],\n  selector: 'person',\n  template: `\n    <ng-container\n      *ngTemplateOutlet=\"\n        myTemplateRef;\n        context: { $implicit: 'test', xxx: 'xxx' }\n      \"></ng-container>\n  `,\n})\nexport class PersonComponent {\n  myTemplateRef!: TemplateRef<MyContext>;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it does not compile now because the 'xxx' property does not exist in 'MyContext', resulting in the error: 'Type '{ $implicit: string; xxx: string; }' is not assignable to type 'MyContext'.'\n\nThe solution is either:\n\n-   add the 'xxx' property to 'MyContext' with the correct type or\n-   add '$any(...)' inside the template to make the error disappear. However, adding '$any(...)' does not correct the error but only preserves the previous behavior of the code.\n-   Deprecated `XhrFactory` export from `@angular/common/http` has been removed. Use `XhrFactory` from `@angular/common` instead.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   -   TypeScript 4.8 is no longer supported.\n\n##### core\n\n-   QueryList.filter now supports type guard functions, which will result in type narrowing. Previously if you used type guard functions, it resulted in no changes to the return type. Now the type would be narrowed, which might require updates to the application code that relied on the old behavior.\n-   `zone.js` versions `0.11.x` and `0.12.x` are not longer supported.\n-   -   `entryComponents` has been deleted from the `@NgModule` and `@Component` public APIs. Any usages can be removed since they weren't doing anyting.\n    -   `ANALYZE_FOR_ENTRY_COMPONENTS` injection token has been deleted. Any references can be removed.\n-   ComponentRef.setInput will only set the input on the\n    component if it is different from the previous value (based on `Object.is`\n    equality). If code relies on the input always being set, it should be\n    updated to copy objects or wrap primitives in order to ensure the input\n    value differs from the previous call to `setInput`.\n-   `RendererType2.styles` no longer accepts a nested arrays.\n-   The `APP_ID` token value is no longer randomly generated. If you are bootstrapping multiple application on the same page you will need to set to provide the `APP_ID` yourself.\n\n    ```ts\n    bootstrapApplication(ComponentA, {\n      providers: [\n       { provide: APP_ID, useValue: 'app-a' },\n       // ... other providers ...\n      ]\n    });\n    ```\n-   The `ReflectiveInjector` and related symbols were removed. Please update the code to avoid references to the `ReflectiveInjector` symbol. Use `Injector.create` as a replacement to create an injector instead.\n-   Node.js v14 support has been removed\n\n    Node.js v14 is planned to be End-of-Life on 2023-04-30. Angular will stop supporting Node.js v14 in Angular v16. Angular v16 will continue to officially support Node.js versions v16 and v18.\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   The deprecated `BrowserTransferStateModule` was removed, since it's no longer needed. The `TransferState` class can be injected without providing the module. The `BrowserTransferStateModule` was empty starting from v14 and you can just remove the reference to that module from your applications.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   Users that are using SSR with JIT mode will now need to add  `import to @&#8203;angular/compiler` before bootstrapping the application.\n\n    **NOTE:** this does not effect users using the Angular CLI.\n-   `renderApplication` method no longer accepts a root component as first argument. Instead, provide a bootstrapping function that returns a `Promise<ApplicationRef>`.\n\n    Before\n\n    ```ts\n    const output: string = await renderApplication(RootComponent, options);\n    ```\n\n    Now\n\n    ```ts\n    const bootstrap = () => bootstrapApplication(RootComponent, appConfig);\n    const output: string = await renderApplication(bootstrap, options);\n    ```\n-   `renderModuleFactory` has been removed. Use `renderModule` instead.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `Scroll` event's `routerEvent` property may also be\n    a `NavigationSkipped` event. Previously, it was only a `NavigationEnd`\n    event.\n-   `ComponentFactoryResolver` has been removed from Router APIs.\n    Component factories are not required to create an instance of a component\n    dynamically. Passing a factory resolver via resolver argument is no longer needed\n    and code can instead use `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` without the\n    factory resolver.\n-   The `RouterEvent` type is no longer present in the `Event` union type representing all router event types. If you have code using something like `filter((e: Event): e is RouterEvent => e instanceof RouterEvent)`, you'll need to update it to `filter((e: Event|RouterEvent): e is RouterEvent => e instanceof RouterEvent)`.\n-   Tests which mock `ActivatedRoute` instances may need to be adjusted\n    because Router.createUrlTree now does the right thing in more\n    scenarios. This means that tests with invalid/incomplete ActivatedRoute mocks\n    may behave differently than before. Additionally, tests may now navigate\n    to a real URL where before they would navigate to the root. Ensure that\n    tests provide expected routes to match.\n    There is rarely production impact, but it has been found that relative\n    navigations when using an `ActivatedRoute` that does not appear in the\n    current router state were effectively ignored in the past. By creating\n    the correct URLs, this sometimes resulted in different navigation\n    behavior in the application. Most often, this happens when attempting to\n    create a navigation that only updates query params using an empty\n    command array, for example `router.navigate([], {relativeTo: route,\n    queryParams: newQueryParams})`. In this case, the `relativeTo` property\n    should be removed.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState` exports have been moved from `@angular/platform-browser` to `@angular/core`. Please update the imports.\n\n```diff\n- import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@&#8203;angular/platform-browser';\n+ import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@&#8203;angular/core';\n```\n\n-   `EnvironmentInjector.runInContext` is now deprecated, with\n    `runInInjectionContext` functioning as a direct replacement:\n\n    ```typescript\n    // Previous method version (deprecated):\n    envInjector.runInContext(fn);\n    // New standalone function:\n    runInInjectionContext(envInjector, fn);\n    ```\n-   The `@Directive`/`@Component` `moduleId` property is now\n    deprecated. It did not have any effect for multiple major versions and\n    will be removed in v17.\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   `BrowserModule.withServerTransition` has been deprecated. `APP_ID` should be used instead to set the application ID.\n    NB: Unless, you render multiple Angular applications on the same page, setting an application ID is not necessary.\n\n    Before:\n\n    ```ts\n    imports: [\n      BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: 'serverApp' }),\n      ...\n    ]\n    ```\n\n    After:\n\n    ```ts\n    imports: [\n      BrowserModule,\n      { provide: APP_ID, useValue: 'serverApp' },\n      ...\n    ],\n    ```\n-   `ApplicationConfig` has moved, please import `ApplicationConfig` from `@angular/core` instead.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   `PlatformConfig.baseUrl` and `PlatformConfig.useAbsoluteUrl` platform-server config options  are deprecated as these were not used.\n\n#####\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

[`v16.0.0`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1600-2023-05-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/16.0.0-rc.4...16.0.0)\n\n[Blog post \"Angular v16 is now available\"](http://goo.gle/angular-v16).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n#####\n\n-   Angular Compatibility Compiler (ngcc) has been removed and as a result Angular View Engine libraries will no longer work\n-   Deprecated `EventManager` method `addGlobalEventListener` has been removed as it is not used by Ivy.\n\n##### bazel\n\n-   Several changes to the Angular Package Format (APF)\n    -   Removal of FESM2015\n    -   Replacing ES2020 with ES2022\n    -   Replacing FESM2020 with FESM2022\n-   Several changes to the Angular Package Format (APF)\n    -   Removal of FESM2015\n    -   Replacing ES2020 with ES2022\n    -   Replacing FESM2020 with FESM2022\n\n##### common\n\n-   `MockPlatformLocation` is now provided by default in tests.\n    Existing tests may have behaviors which rely on\n    `BrowserPlatformLocation` instead. For example, direct access to the\n    `window.history` in either the test or the component rather than going\n    through the Angular APIs (`Location.getState()`). The quickest fix is to\n    update the providers in the test suite to override the provider again\n    `TestBed.configureTestingModule({providers: [{provide: PlatformLocation, useClass: BrowserPlatformLocation}]})`.\n    The ideal fix would be to update the code to instead be compatible with\n    `MockPlatformLocation` instead.\n-   If the 'ngTemplateOutletContext' is different from the context, it will result in a compile-time error.\n\nBefore the change, the following template was compiling:\n\n```typescript\ninterface MyContext {\n  $implicit: string;\n}\n\n@&#8203;Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [NgTemplateOutlet],\n  selector: 'person',\n  template: `\n    <ng-container\n      *ngTemplateOutlet=\"\n        myTemplateRef;\n        context: { $implicit: 'test', xxx: 'xxx' }\n      \"></ng-container>\n  `,\n})\nexport class PersonComponent {\n  myTemplateRef!: TemplateRef<MyContext>;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it does not compile now because the 'xxx' property does not exist in 'MyContext', resulting in the error: 'Type '{ $implicit: string; xxx: string; }' is not assignable to type 'MyContext'.'\n\nThe solution is either:\n\n-   add the 'xxx' property to 'MyContext' with the correct type or\n-   add '$any(...)' inside the template to make the error disappear. However, adding '$any(...)' does not correct the error but only preserves the previous behavior of the code.\n-   Deprecated `XhrFactory` export from `@angular/common/http` has been removed. Use `XhrFactory` from `@angular/common` instead.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   -   TypeScript 4.8 is no longer supported.\n\n##### core\n\n-   QueryList.filter now supports type guard functions, which will result in type narrowing. Previously if you used type guard functions, it resulted in no changes to the return type. Now the type would be narrowed, which might require updates to the application code that relied on the old behavior.\n-   `zone.js` versions `0.11.x` and `0.12.x` are not longer supported.\n-   -   `entryComponents` has been deleted from the `@NgModule` and `@Component` public APIs. Any usages can be removed since they weren't doing anyting.\n    -   `ANALYZE_FOR_ENTRY_COMPONENTS` injection token has been deleted. Any references can be removed.\n-   ComponentRef.setInput will only set the input on the\n    component if it is different from the previous value (based on `Object.is`\n    equality). If code relies on the input always being set, it should be\n    updated to copy objects or wrap primitives in order to ensure the input\n    value differs from the previous call to `setInput`.\n-   `RendererType2.styles` no longer accepts a nested arrays.\n-   The `APP_ID` token value is no longer randomly generated. If you are bootstrapping multiple application on the same page you will need to set to provide the `APP_ID` yourself.\n\n    ```ts\n    bootstrapApplication(ComponentA, {\n      providers: [\n       { provide: APP_ID, useValue: 'app-a' },\n       // ... other providers ...\n      ]\n    });\n    ```\n-   The `ReflectiveInjector` and related symbols were removed. Please update the code to avoid references to the `ReflectiveInjector` symbol. Use `Injector.create` as a replacement to create an injector instead.\n-   Node.js v14 support has been removed\n\n    Node.js v14 is planned to be End-of-Life on 2023-04-30. Angular will stop supporting Node.js v14 in Angular v16. Angular v16 will continue to officially support Node.js versions v16 and v18.\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   The deprecated `BrowserTransferStateModule` was removed, since it's no longer needed. The `TransferState` class can be injected without providing the module. The `BrowserTransferStateModule` was empty starting from v14 and you can just remove the reference to that module from your applications.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   Users that are using SSR with JIT mode will now need to add  `import to @&#8203;angular/compiler` before bootstrapping the application.\n\n    **NOTE:** this does not effect users using the Angular CLI.\n-   `renderApplication` method no longer accepts a root component as first argument. Instead, provide a bootstrapping function that returns a `Promise<ApplicationRef>`.\n\n    Before\n\n    ```ts\n    const output: string = await renderApplication(RootComponent, options);\n    ```\n\n    Now\n\n    ```ts\n    const bootstrap = () => bootstrapApplication(RootComponent, appConfig);\n    const output: string = await renderApplication(bootstrap, options);\n    ```\n-   `renderModuleFactory` has been removed. Use `renderModule` instead.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `Scroll` event's `routerEvent` property may also be\n    a `NavigationSkipped` event. Previously, it was only a `NavigationEnd`\n    event.\n-   `ComponentFactoryResolver` has been removed from Router APIs.\n    Component factories are not required to create an instance of a component\n    dynamically. Passing a factory resolver via resolver argument is no longer needed\n    and code can instead use `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` without the\n    factory resolver.\n-   The `RouterEvent` type is no longer present in the `Event` union type representing all router event types. If you have code using something like `filter((e: Event): e is RouterEvent => e instanceof RouterEvent)`, you'll need to update it to `filter((e: Event|RouterEvent): e is RouterEvent => e instanceof RouterEvent)`.\n-   Tests which mock `ActivatedRoute` instances may need to be adjusted\n    because Router.createUrlTree now does the right thing in more\n    scenarios. This means that tests with invalid/incomplete ActivatedRoute mocks\n    may behave differently than before. Additionally, tests may now navigate\n    to a real URL where before they would navigate to the root. Ensure that\n    tests provide expected routes to match.\n    There is rarely production impact, but it has been found that relative\n    navigations when using an `ActivatedRoute` that does not appear in the\n    current router state were effectively ignored in the past. By creating\n    the correct URLs, this sometimes resulted in different navigation\n    behavior in the application. Most often, this happens when attempting to\n    create a navigation that only updates query params using an empty\n    command array, for example `router.navigate([], {relativeTo: route,\n    queryParams: newQueryParams})`. In this case, the `relativeTo` property\n    should be removed.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### core\n\n-   `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState` exports have been moved from `@angular/platform-browser` to `@angular/core`. Please update the imports.\n\n```diff\n- import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@&#8203;angular/platform-browser';\n+ import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@&#8203;angular/core';\n```\n\n-   `EnvironmentInjector.runInContext` is now deprecated, with\n    `runInInjectionContext` functioning as a direct replacement:\n\n    ```typescript\n    // Previous method version (deprecated):\n    envInjector.runInContext(fn);\n    // New standalone function:\n    runInInjectionContext(envInjector, fn);\n    ```\n-   The `@Directive`/`@Component` `moduleId` property is now\n    deprecated. It did not have any effect for multiple major versions and\n    will be removed in v17.\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   `BrowserModule.withServerTransition` has been deprecated. `APP_ID` should be used instead to set the application ID.\n    NB: Unless, you render multiple Angular applications on the same page, setting an application ID is not necessary.\n\n    Before:\n\n    ```ts\n    imports: [\n      BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: 'serverApp' }),\n      ...\n    ]\n    ```\n\n    After:\n\n    ```ts\n    imports: [\n      BrowserModule,\n      { provide: APP_ID, useValue: 'serverApp' },\n      ...\n    ],\n    ```\n-   `ApplicationConfig` has moved, please import `ApplicationConfig` from `@angular/core` instead.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   `PlatformConfig.baseUrl` and `PlatformConfig.useAbsoluteUrl` platform-server config options  are deprecated as these were not used.\n\n#####\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

Reactive Form is used. FormBuilder and FormGroup was used to create formcontrols.\r\n2. After upgrade, All material imports was updated to legacy option. (Example - MatButtonLegacy)\r\n3. In angular v10, Two-way data binding ([(ngModel)]) has been used to bind the id of the selected option, it worked fine.\r\n4. But in v15 we have tried by removing the ngModel, still not fixed.\r\n5. Have tired with [(value)] way of binding, that too didn't give a hand.\r\n6. This is not a multiple select.\r\n7. We have used exact code mentioned below in angular v10 and its not working in angular v15. Find the sample example here - https://material.angular.io/components/select/examples#select-form\r\n\r\n**Support Needed**\r\n1. Angular support team to provide a solution to fix the issue in Mat-Select drop down.\r\n2. To provide if any code changes or import level changes has to be done.\r\n3. We have tested with angular v15.2.4 and material version as v12.2.13, all seems fine.\r\n4. Is it fine to have a downgraded material version with  higher angular version?.\r\n5. **Kindly respond whether it is a good standard to have Angular v15.2.4 and material v12.2.13 as part of production release or provide an fix for the issue in the upgraded versions for both angular and material v15.2.4.**\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly refer the below attachment which shows actual issue in the dropdown after selecting an option, the field is blank;\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"696\" alt=\"b4bc512e-f815-4e50-b949-c68a2370b082\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62600471/235129808-52abe281-fb86-475d-b6e5-b3e0698e7519.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

For this I have an boolean \"editable\" which I'm attribute-binding to readonly as described in [Angular's documentation](https://angular.io/guide/attribute-binding) (`[attr.readonly]=\"editable ? null : 'readonly'\"`). However, this binding seems to be ignored initially. When changing the editable field later, the binding works.\r\n\r\nI've built this stackblitz to demonstrate: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-attribute-bug-12079483?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\nThe native textarea behaves correctly (i.e. is readonly) from the start. The mat-form-field wrapped textarea only becomes readonly after toggling the button twice.\r\n\r\nA further detail I've found: If 'editable' is initialized to true (right at it's declaration), and then set to false in ngAfterViewInit, the binding works. If setting to false is done in ngOnInit already, it doesn't work. It also doesn't work if editable was initialized to false in the first place.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Without touching the toggle button in the stackblitz, edit the second textarea. Observe that it works (when it shouldn't)\r\n2. Toggle the button twice\r\n3. Observe that both textareas are now readonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBoth textareas should start off readonly.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nOnly the non-wrapped textarea starts off readonly.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.3.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): I checked Chrome and Firefox, I presume it's all of them\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27020","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(matInput): Attribute binding doesn't initially work on mat-form-field wrapped textarea\" (#27020)"},{"Id":"1692777310","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-02T17:01:20","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"27018","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP for internal g3 testing only - see #26028 for full PR","State":"open","Body":"Swap out the current logic for determining when to resize the outline\r\ngap, for logic based on ResizeObserver.

Also, `<mat-card>` without an `appearance` attribute defaults to `raised`.\r\n\r\nHowever, MDC migration for angular V15 always changes `<mat-card>` to `<mat-card appearance='outlined` /> (see https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24566/files#diff-b75b20ff5d2952053d36ef0a202e088d8533fb2e45be536f37973d923cdb0482). \r\n\r\nWhy is that?

Indeed if one want to set up an index.ts, using only the export * from './componentName we can now decrease the line by line fullpath components.\r\n\r\n[This article](https://dev.to/jwp/a-module-s-implied-index-ts-file-5016) shows the impact of using the index.ts system..  \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAny Angular Compile should be able to discover anything it needs to compile based only on decorators. Additionally the exports section should contribute somehow to the Javascript module system.  As it is now there's duplication of effort when in fact there should not be any duplication. \r\n\r\nCan't the build itself generate it's own index files based on a configuration setting?  That way we'd only need to focus on the ngModule system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n \r\n1) The compile based on a configuration setting could output the index.ts files.\r\n2) Somehow the ngModule exports statements double as an index.ts type export.\r\n3) Do away with the ngModule class and let the compiler discover all the content needed to compile using the namespace concept just like .NET does.  Imports are single line in .NET but they are implicit to the build, intellisense finds the folders automatically without any index concept. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38056","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng modules\" (#38056)"},{"Id":"656798984","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T18:06:12","Actor":"alexDtorres","Number":"38054","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(bazel): fix typo in comments","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

After much research, the upgrade was successful. Following the upgrade, I found a bug on form valueChanges with dynamically changing textarea maxlength. I am dynamically changing the maxlength of the textarea based on previous input field in same form. When doing so, form valueChanges gets fired twice and eventually causing `Error: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked` error. I have produced a minimal repo below with one textarea and changing it's maxlength dynamically while typing in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-oubtwj\r\nTry giving any input to textarea and observe stackblitz console\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->Error: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version: 10.0.3**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.2\r\nNode: 12.12.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router, service-worker\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.2\r\n@angular/cdk                      10.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.2\r\n@angular/material                 10.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.2\r\n@nguniversal/builders             10.0.1\r\n@nguniversal/common               10.0.1\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine       10.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.2\r\nrxjs                              6.6.0\r\ntypescript                        3.9.6\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

As part of that work, the `<live-example>` tags were also copied to the new guides. These `<live-example>` tags did not specify the targeted example project via the `name` attribute, thus they were implicitly targeting the example with the same name as the guide they were in. See the [Docs style guide][1] for more info.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is only one example project (`testing/`) and all `<live-example>` tags were supposed to target that. This worked fine on the `testing.md` guide, but it broke on other guides (which tried to target non-existing example projects based on their names).\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes it by explicitly specifying which example is targeted by the `<live-example>` tags.

as there are no common public functions available.\r\nA quick [search on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=schematic%20utils) leads to many community project results.\r\nHowever as the Angular CLI itself uses the schematics and common utils, which are already tested and well defined, they should be available for the public.\r\n\r\nFor example the package [`@ockilson/schematic-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ockilson/schematics-utils#dependencies) implements the same (or almost the same) functions as already available in the [Angular CLI repo](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/schematics/angular/utility/dependencies.ts)\r\n\r\nTo prevent some common pitfalls such functions and code duplications such common functions should be exported by `@angular-devkit/schematics`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nExport all functions from [packages/schematics/angular/utility](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/schematics/angular/utility) to be available for other schematics.\r\nI think they should be exported via `@angular-devkit/schematics` or as `@angular-devkit/schematics/utils`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18250","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Export Schematics util

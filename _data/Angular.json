After some learning time, I've come to realize what a great tool Angular Schematics is! In my opinion, one thing is missing though: the templating part of the tool could really benefit from a Language Service with code completion based on what we make available for the templates or even a small language support plugin.\r\n\r\nIn VSCode, the '*.template' files are shown as raw text and even if I configure the IDE to understand them as the proper typings (.ts, for instance), it explodes with errors (rightfully, of course, since the imports and templating syntax won't be recognized).\r\n\r\nI think better IDE support could really improve Schematics developer experience and increase its usage in the community, which would be great since it's such an amazing tool!\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtend Angular Language Service to deal with the '.template' files. As they are only templates, I don't see a way to provide full Typescript support within the files, but maybe there's a way to at least format/color the code for a better developing experience.\r\n\r\nAs for the templating syntax, it would be great to have code completion and info based on what is passed to the `applyTemplates` function. Real-time info on the variations of templating syntax (`<%`, `<%-`, `<%=`) would help a lot too!\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI've looked for community plugins, with no success. Right now, I'm using the EJS Language support plugin, which gives the templating syntax some coloring.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46810","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Language Service for Angular Schematics template files\" (#46810)"},{"Id":"1302522749","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T20:37:03","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"46808","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove `destroy` from the EnvironmentInjector's public API","State":"closed","Body":"This commit updates the `EnvironmentInjector` class to annotate the `destroy` method as internal.

Given a library (`lib`) and a project (`app`) in an angular workspace. The library properly copies an scss file to the `dist` folder (which is the default output folder) and adds it to the `exports` section of the `package.json`. However, the consuming app cannot `@import` or `@use` the exported scss file.\r\n\r\nGiven the following files:\r\n\r\n- dist/my-company/my-lib/assets/_theme.scss\r\n- projects/app/src/styles.scss\r\n\r\nAnd the following export in the `package.json` of the library:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"exports\": {\r\n  \"./theme\": {\r\n    \"sass\": \"./assets/_theme.scss\"\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the default settings that the Angular CLI generates (with `ng new library` and so on...),\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWith the settings mentioned above, importing an exported scss file should work out of the box (currently it does not compile with the error `SassError: Can't find stylesheet to import.`).\r\n\r\n```\r\n// styles.scss\r\n@use \"@my-company/my-lib/theme\" as myTheme;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n1. Changing the default `dist` output of the library to the `node_modules` and the automatically removed `@` symbol is added to the path (in short `dist/my-company/my-lib` -> `node_modules/@my-company/my-lib`) resolves the scss import problem. The `tsconfig.json` must be adjusted as well. If this is the desired solution, then it should be the default generated with the CLI.\r\n2. Create an NPM Link to the dist directory (which has its own pros and cons). If this is the desired solution, then the `tsconfig.json` does not need to define additional `paths` and this should be an operation that the generation (through the CLI) does automatically. Or at least extend [the documentation](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#managing-assets-in-a-library).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23552","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Workspace

was: ....\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen changing from target: \"es2020\" to target: \"es2022\" something involving webpack/babel is causing `_this` to no longer exist. The folks at babel are looking into it (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/14749), but they requested an open question as to why we are asyncToGenerator at all.\r\n\r\nI have forced my browserslist to be 100% supporting native async/await and it still runs this. I also cannot determine any way to force this plugin to not be processed at all.\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nIn Angular 13/14 have a function formatted\r\n```\r\nnameOfFunction = async () => {\r\n  this.doThing();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbuild this once with a 2020 target and then again with 2022 target and see the difference in the generated code. The 2022 version doesn't have `_this`. I don't think i expect angular to have a fix for this, unless it is a bug that we are interacting with asyncToGenerator at all.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.4\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.4\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.4\r\n@angular/flex-layout            14.0.0-beta.40\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.4\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n\r\nwebpack 5.73\r\nbabel: 7.17\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nI wasn't really sure how to phrase this as a bug, as it's more a question.

when direct `eval` is present ([#&#8203;2361](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2361))\n\n    Version 0.14.19 of esbuild added inlining of certain `const` variables during minification, which replaces all references to the variable with the initializer and then removes the variable declaration. However, this could generate incorrect code when direct `eval` is present because the direct `eval` could reference the constant by name. This release fixes the problem by preserving the `const` variable declaration in this case:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log((() => { const x = 123; return x + eval('x') }))\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(()=>123+eval(\"x\"));\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(()=>{const x=123;return 123+eval(\"x\")});\n    ```\n\n-   Fix an incorrect error in TypeScript when targeting ES5 ([#&#8203;2375](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2375))\n\n    Previously when compiling TypeScript code to ES5, esbuild could incorrectly consider the following syntax forms as a transformation error:\n\n    ```ts\n    0 ? ([]) : 1 ? ({}) : 2;\n    ```\n\n    The error messages looked like this:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Transforming destructuring to the configured target environment (\"es5\") is not supported yet\n\n            example.ts:1:5:\n              1 │ 0 ? ([]) : 1 ? ({}) : 2;\n                ╵      ^\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Transforming destructuring to the configured target environment (\"es5\") is not supported yet\n\n            example.ts:1:16:\n              1 │ 0 ? ([]) : 1 ? ({}) : 2;\n                ╵                 ^\n\n    These parenthesized literals followed by a colon look like the start of an arrow function expression followed by a TypeScript return type (e.g. `([]) : 1` could be the start of the TypeScript arrow function `([]): 1 => 1`). Unlike in JavaScript, parsing arrow functions in TypeScript requires backtracking. In this case esbuild correctly determined that this expression wasn't an arrow function after all but the check for destructuring was incorrectly not covered under the backtracking process. With this release, the error message is now only reported if the parser successfully parses an arrow function without backtracking.\n\n-   Fix generated TypeScript `enum` comments containing `*/` ([#&#8203;2369](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2369), [#&#8203;2371](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2371))\n\n    TypeScript `enum` values that are equal to a number or string literal are inlined (references to the enum are replaced with the literal value) and have a `/* ... */` comment after them with the original enum name to improve readability. However, this comment is omitted if the enum name contains the character sequence `*/` because that would end the comment early and cause a syntax error:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript\n    enum Foo { '/*' = 1, '*/' = 2 }\n    console.log(Foo['/*'], Foo['*/'])\n\n    // Generated JavaScript\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2);\n    ```\n\n    This was originally handled correctly when TypeScript `enum` inlining was initially implemented since it was only supported within a single file. However, when esbuild was later extended to support TypeScript `enum` inlining across files, this special case where the enum name contains `*/` was not handled in that new code. Starting with this release, esbuild will now handle enums with names containing `*/` correctly when they are inlined across files:\n\n    ```ts\n    // foo.ts\n    export enum Foo { '/*' = 1, '*/' = 2 }\n\n    // bar.ts\n    import { Foo } from './foo'\n    console.log(Foo['/*'], Foo['*/'])\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle --format=esm)\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2 /* */ */);\n\n    // New output (with --bundle --format=esm)\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2);\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Allow `declare` class fields to be initialized ([#&#8203;2380](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2380))\n\n    This release fixes an oversight in the TypeScript parser that disallowed initializers for `declare` class fields. TypeScript actually allows the following limited initializer expressions for `readonly` fields:\n\n    ```ts\n    declare const enum a { b = 0 }\n\n    class Foo {\n      // These are allowed by TypeScript\n      declare readonly a = 0\n      declare readonly b = -0\n      declare readonly c = 0n\n      declare readonly d = -0n\n      declare readonly e = 'x'\n      declare readonly f = `x`\n      declare readonly g = a.b\n      declare readonly h = a['b']\n\n      // These are not allowed by TypeScript\n      declare readonly x = (0)\n      declare readonly y = null\n      declare readonly z = -a.b\n    }\n    ```\n\n    So with this release, esbuild now allows initializers for `declare` class fields too. To future-proof this in case TypeScript allows more expressions as initializers in the future (such as `null`), esbuild will allow any expression as an initializer and will leave the specifics of TypeScript's special-casing here to the TypeScript type checker.\n\n-   Fix a bug in esbuild's feature compatibility table generator ([#&#8203;2365](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2365))\n\n    Passing specific JavaScript engines to esbuild's `--target` flag restricts esbuild to only using JavaScript features that are supported on those engines in the output files that esbuild generates. The data for this feature is automatically derived from this compatibility table with a script: https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/.\n\n    However, the script had a bug that could incorrectly consider a JavaScript syntax feature to be supported in a given engine even when it doesn't actually work in that engine. Specifically this bug happened when a certain aspect of JavaScript syntax has always worked incorrectly in that engine and the bug in that engine has never been fixed. This situation hasn't really come up before because previously esbuild pretty much only targeted JavaScript engines that always fix their bugs, but the two new JavaScript engines that were added in the previous release ([Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) and [Rhino](https://togithub.com/mozilla/rhino)) have many aspects of the JavaScript specification that have never been implemented, and may never be implemented. For example, the `let` and `const` keywords are not implemented correctly in those engines.\n\n    With this release, esbuild's compatibility table generator script has been fixed and as a result, esbuild will now correctly consider a JavaScript syntax feature to be unsupported in a given engine if there is some aspect of that syntax that is broken in all known versions of that engine.

The DatePicker is showing Friday 25 March as the date, but the dropdown picker highlights 27th of Jamadi Akhar (6th lunar month), and showing on top right 22/8/1443.

Create an injector `const myInjector = Injector.create({\r\n      providers: [{ provide: SomeService }]\r\n    });`\r\n4. Pass the injector `injector: myInjector`` to ``this.dialog.open`\r\n5. Require the service `public someService: SomeService` in `DialogOverviewExampleDialog`'s constructor\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`SomeService` gets provided to `DialogOverviewExampleDialog`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(AppModule)[SomeService -> SomeService -> SomeService]: \r\n  NullInjectorError: No provider for SomeService!\r\n    at NullInjector.get (vendor.js:66456:21)\r\n    at R3Injector.get (vendor.js:66652:27)\r\n    at R3Injector.get (vendor.js:66652:27)\r\n    at R3Injector.get (vendor.js:66652:27)\r\n    at NgModuleRef.get (vendor.js:81766:29)\r\n    at ChainedInjector.get (vendor.js:81534:32)\r\n    at lookupTokenUsingModuleInjector (vendor.js:59680:31)\r\n    at getOrCreateInjectable (vendor.js:59732:10)\r\n    at Module.ɵɵdirectiveInject (vendor.js:67961:10)\r\n    at NodeInjectorFactory.DialogOverviewExampleDialog_Factory [as factory] (main.js:153:195)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.5\r\nAngular: 14.0.5\r\nAngular Material: 14.0.4        \r\nNode: 16.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.0 \r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nI glanced into the source code and I think the injector from the config is taken into account only when creating/attaching the \r\ncontainer:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/c28bbdeb51c31cbd1f5e06528ef4d21b1650e4a8/src/cdk/dialog/dialog.ts#L224\r\nbut not when creating/attaching the actual content component:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/c28bbdeb51c31cbd1f5e06528ef4d21b1650e4a8/src/cdk/dialog/dialog.ts#L311\r\nand it seems that from a DI point of view, the implementation does not tie the content's Injector with the container's Injector. Again, I might be wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25262","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Dialog): Explicit injector does not work\" (#25262)"},{"Id":"1301979972","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T12:16:48","Actor":"JonWallsten","Number":"25261","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatDialog): afterOpened is not always called, probably due to change detection issues","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNote sure\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is an intermittent issue. But I have scenarios where it fails 80% of the time. I think it got a little bit worse when I went from 13.x.x -> 14.x.x. But that might be due to other code changes. \r\nI don't think I can reproduce it in StackBlitz since it's involved a complex setup and a chain of events.\r\nBut I can certainly try if the description is not detailed enough.\r\n\r\nWhen opening dialogs the `afterOpened()` observer is not always \"called\". And since that's where I run `updateSize()` and `updatePosition()`. The dialog ends up looking like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5993909/178484322-8794ebc8-650e-429f-8276-9a00a269dda6.png)\r\n\r\nIf I run `this.cd.markForCheck()` after the dialog code the observer is called, so it definitely has something to do with Change Detection. However this is a feasible solution since I open the dialogs from a common services, where injecting ChangeDetectionref is not possible.\r\n\r\n`this.applicationRef.tick();` does not help (I thought this was a Global Change detection tick?)\r\n\r\nThe reason I think Change detection is not working properly is because we use native async/await.\r\nHowever I use the `zone.run()` code for that reason:\r\n```\r\nreturn this.zone.run(() => {\r\n    const dialog = this.matDialog.open<T>(template, { ...config, viewContainerRef: !useGlobalViewRef ? this.viewContainerRef : undefined });\r\n    dialog.afterOpened().subscribe(() => {\r\n        if (!config.width) {\r\n            dialog.updateSize();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!config.position) {\r\n            dialog.updatePosition();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    return dialog;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I still get the issue. This code responsible for calling the `afterOpened` observer is never reached:\r\n```\r\n_containerInstance._animationStateChanged.pipe((0,WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_8__.filter)(event => event.state === 'opened'), (0,WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_9__.take)(1)).subscribe(() => {\r\n  this._afterOpened.next();\r\n\r\n  this._afterOpened.complete();\r\n}); // Dispose overlay when closing animation is complete\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the dialog is created, opened and visible on screen. But the `_animationStateChanged` event does not seem to happen, which causes the `afterOpened` observable to never be \"called\".\r\n\r\nShould it be this dependent on Change detection to work? And why does running it in the zone not make the internal `Change Detection` in the `MatDialog` component to work?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `afterOpened()` observer should be \"called\"\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `afterOpened()` observer is not called due to some animationStateChange not being triggered due to Change Detection issues.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.1\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.1 \r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core \r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1400.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1302.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              14.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        14.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  14.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               14.0.1\r\nng-packagr                        14.0.2\r\nrxjs                              7.5.5\r\ntypescript                        4.7.3\r\nwebpack                           5.73.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25261","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatDialog): afterOpened is not always called, probably due to change detection issues\" (#25261)"},{"Id":"1301967400","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T12:05:39","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25260","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dependency Dashboard","State":"open","Body":"This issue lists Renovate updates and detected dependencies.

Some suggestions:\r\n\r\n- The stackblitz is very very hard to read. There is one .ts file with 2 components and 3 classes, and one of the components in the file references a separate template file with a completely different name. Why not just use another file altogether for the .ts and use the same name as the template?\r\n- The accessibility section briefly mentions things like setDescribedByIds(), but the actual implementation doesn't even use many things mentioned (and when I tried to use the exact example, was met with many errors I couldn't get past).\r\n- accommodate strict typescript settings, which many people use/are forced to use at work. I ran into many problems with this. Many @Inputs needed to be initialized, and I wasn't sure if I should just use the safe navigation or non-null assertion operators. I think the official documentation should be using the strictest forms of typechecking/null checking instead of the many \"any\" types that are so often used (not in this guide, but elsewhere in angular docs). It would make things much easier, and also stop teaching so people bad habits.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25244","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): Custom Form Field Control documentation is very confusing and hard to read\" (#25244)"},{"Id":"1299592034","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-09T07:02:15","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25243","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): prevent outside clicks from going to other overlays","State":"open","Body":"Adds a subscription to the outside click stream of the autocomplete overlay so that the events don't propagate to other overlays which may close the autocomplete prematurely.\r\n\r\nFixes #25238.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25243","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): prevent outside clicks from going to other overlays\" (#25243)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-07-14T03:30:02.8799458Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1934}

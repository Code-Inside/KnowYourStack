This is because of a circular dependency which requires the use of `setComponentScope()` to be used. `setComponentScope()` is inherently side-effectful, and is the compiler's way of working around circular dependencies, where it can not import the required dependencies to define a template scope without causing a cycle in the import graph.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to remove the cycle, and the compiler will be able to generate code that does **not** use `setComponentScope()`. This should allow compilers like Closure to tree shake unused components in `RouterModule`.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nImport something from `RouterModule` (such as `RouterLink`). In the output bundle (at least for Closure, I didn't check Terser) it will include `RouterLinkActive`, despite the fact that it was not actually used in the application.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** `master`\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

To work around this, the compiler defers this task to run time with `setComponentScope()`, effective setting the component template to use the entire module as a scope. This is a deoptimization which comes from a circular reference in source code. Missing this optimization means that tree shaking is less effective. For example, `RouterModule` appears to generate `setComponentScope()` and as a result, `routerLinkActive` can not be tree shaken even if it is never used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> The compiler should warn or error when such a case occurs (probably only if the user set a particular flag). This would allow performance sensitive code (such as `@angular/core`) to restrict itself to not include circular references to allow better tree shaking. Ideally this would print out the full path of the cycle so users could attempt to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Currently the best workaround is to grep output deobfuscated code for `setComponentScope()` and identify the modules it was used with. You then just have to \"figure out\" exactly how the circular dependency was introduced and what the best way of fixing it is.\r\n\r\nI made https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38210, which is a patch to the compiler which prints out any cycled identified and then fails the build. This is a hacky means of figuring out exactly what cycle is causing `setComponentScope()`.

For example, Material does this with `MatButton` and `MatAnchor`.\r\n\r\nView Engine had a feature which converted `styleUrls` into `.ngstyle.js` classes with exported constants, and thus naturally deduplicated reuse of external stylesheets. Ivy does not perform this optimization by design - it was a design goal to remove all additional \"shim\" files.\r\n\r\nA limited form of this optimization in Ivy is possible - within a single file, it should be possible to use the `ConstantPool` to deduplicate stylesheet text that is shared between multiple components. This would be useful both for external stylesheets as well as inline style text, as long as it's identical. This optimization is of course conditional on `ViewEncapsulation` - encapsulated and un-encapsulated styles will have different contents, and thus no reuse between them is possible.\r\n\r\nThis optimization would apply to the Material example above, since `MatButton` and `MatAnchor` are both declared in the same TS file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38204","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \" Share identical stylesheets between components in the same file\" (#38204)"},{"Id":"664713635","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-23T19:27:07","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"38203","RawContent":null,"Title":"ConstantPool timing issue with multiple components in a file","State":"open","Body":"`ConstantPool` deduplicates constants by returning a particular kind of `o.Expression` called a `FixupExpression`, to which it retains a reference. For the first usage, this `FixupExpression` transparently returns the original `o.Expression`, so nothing special happens.\r\n\r\nWhenever the `ConstantPool` encounters a second usage of the same value, however, it creates a shared variable declaration for the value, and uses its reference to the `FixupExpression` to replace its contents with a reference to this variable instead. Thus, the original usage is updated to refer to the constant instead of the literal value.\r\n\r\nThis works as long as all potential constants pass through the `ConstantPool` _before_ any of the `o.Expression` outputs are processed. However, in ngtsc the final compilation of classes violates this condition.\r\n\r\nThis compilation happens in a TypeScript transform (in `ngtsc/transform/src/transform.ts`, within `IvyVisitor`'s `visitClassDeclaration`). Each class goes through a process of `o.Expression` generation (which includes `ConstantPool` wrapping), then reification of `o.Expression`s into `ts.Expression`s via `translateExpression`, and then updating of the `ts.ClassDeclaration` to add the new static properties. Because `o.Expression`s are immediately converted to `ts.Expression`s, any `FixupExpression`s produced by the `ConstantPool` are converted **as they are** immediately following processing of that single class. Any future deduplication based on usage of the same constants by other classes will not affect them.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that such shared constants are always duplicated for the first class that uses them, and all subsequent classes use the shared variable declaration. This only affects constant reuse _between_ classes - constant reuse within the same class works normally.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38203","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ConstantPool timing issue with multiple components in a file\" (#38203)"},{"Id":"664385279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-23T18:08:20","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"38192","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): simplify `ExampleZipper` by removing `PackageJsonCustomizer`","State":"closed","Body":"Previously, `ExampleZipper` (the tool used for creating ZIP archives from our docs examples) used the `PackageJsonCustomizer` to generate `package.json` files for each example type. This had the following drawbacks:\r\n- The generated files had to be kept up-to-date with the corresponding boilerplate files in `aio/tools/examples/shared/boilerplate/` and there was no easy way to find out when the files got out-of-sync.\r\n- The `PackageJsonCustomizer` logic was non-trivial and difficult to reason about.\r\n- The same information was duplicated in the boilerplate files and the customizer configuration files.\r\n\r\nThis setup was useful when we used a single `package.json` file for all docs examples. Now, however, each example type can have its own boilerplate `package.json` file, including scripts and dependencies relevant to the example type. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to generate `package.json` files for ZIP archives.\r\n\r\nThis commit eliminates the drawbacks mentioned above and simplifies the `ExampleZipper` tool by removing `PackageJsonCustomizer` and re-using the boilerplate `package.json` files for ZIP archives.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this commit also fix some ZIP archives that were previously broken (for example due to missing dependencies).\r\n\r\n##\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier to see how the changes in this PR affect the final ZIP archives, I pushed two temporary commits which contained the `package.json` files from all ZIP archives:\r\n- Before this PR (i.e. with `PackageJsonCustomizer`): ea5cf9b6b25c321eaa48848c538c4d30b51484f2\r\n- After this PR (i.e. without `PackageJsonCustomizer`): 1afa5b9fcda656a758a4e45a85e72040aa64d134\r\n\r\nBasically, one can see the resulting changes by looking at the latter (1afa5b9fcda656a758a4e45a85e72040aa64d134).\r\nI looked through all changes and (unless I missed something) all changed `package.json` files contain the same changes as for example [accessibility/package.json](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38192/commits/1afa5b9fcda656a758a4e45a85e72040aa64d134#diff-c7c7cf4e524feac0de7bc88683ee8b1e) with the exception of [universal/package.json](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38192/commits/1afa5b9fcda656a758a4e45a85e72040aa64d134#diff-1d9b6695754ee6b9dedcc09e349b629f) and [upgrade-lazy-load-ajs/package.json](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38192/commits/1afa5b9fcda656a758a4e45a85e72040aa64d134#diff-8f7e2699afc4f026e6d94fb8285da227), which are slightly different.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38192","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build(docs-infra): simplify `ExampleZipper` by removing `PackageJsonCustomizer`\" (#38192)"},{"Id":"664035288","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-23T18:07:36","Actor":"saifabusaleh","Number":"38186","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): correctly display copy button in IE11","State":"closed","Body":"Fix button top portion was clipped in IE11 by setting overflow to visible\r\n\r\nFixes #37816\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

As far as I understand, the suggested replacement is to run `ng serve` with the desired locale every time.\r\n\r\nA little bit background here. We have 2 applications, every with 4 languages. For production, we build it with AOT as suggested. For development we use JIT and load corresponding translation depending on the browser URL (German for `/de/` for example), this mimics prod behavior. So, to switch translation and check how the interface looks in a different language, you just need to pick up another item in the language menu. The page reloads at the same URL but with a different language. Starting from v9 it's not supported, so we would have to run `ng serve` every time for a new language and start from the home page for every language again.\r\n\r\nWhat would be a suggested way repeat v8 behavior? I checked `loadTranslatios` but it accepts a key-value object, not a XLIFF data. Is any function that can transform from XLIFF to a format understandable for `loadTranslations`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.9\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.901.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.901.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.901.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.901.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.901.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.1.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.1.9\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                       9.1.9\r\n@angular/material                  9.2.4\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   9.2.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.1.9\r\n@schematics/angular                9.1.9\r\n@schematics/update                 0.901.9\r\nng-packagr                         9.1.5\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.8.3\r\nwebpack                            4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18331","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[i18n] ability to dynamically load translations for the app\" (#18331)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"663136264","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-24T02:12:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"20057","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(drag-drop): warn if connected container ID doesn't exist","State":"closed","Body":"We support connecting two drop lists by their ID, but if the ID is incorrect, we silently ignore it.

I have a specific use case with a drop list + boundary element, where I **always** want the drag items to be rendered under certain surrounding elements. When the drop list is sitting statically, it looks fine. But when I start dragging, the preview is rendered above everything else - which is okay for a lot of drag and drop scenarios but not mine.\r\n\r\nConsider drop shadow CSS styling. The drop shadow can visually extend beyond the drag boundary, while the element itself is still contained inside the drag boundary. As stated above, when the list and drag items are sitting statically, the drop shadow extending beyond the drag boundary is being hidden by the ordering/z-index/styling of other elements (which is what I want). The moment the preview element (w/ drop shadow applied) becomes active, it's drop shadow is completely visible and extending outside of the drag boundary and there is nothing I can do about it because the preview element is in a completely different DOM location (bottom of document body, on top of everything) nowhere near the drop list and it's neighboring elements.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need anymore info.\r\n\r\nAlso, a public `dragRef.getPlaceholderElement()` method exists. Can a public `dragRef.getPreviewElement()` method also be added to allow accessing the preview element during hooks/events?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20055","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(drag-drop): Custom drag preview insertion location\" (#20055)"},{"Id":"662524949","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-21T04:03:41","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"20051","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"perf(int-bar): Convert MatInkBarFoundation adapter to class o…","State":"closed","Body":"…bject (#19986)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 78dc50bfa5f61158276d6196da2db3921ae4e2fd.\r\n\r\nThis PR was marked merge-safe but caused presubmits to break.\r\nTests were failing because the dev-app doesn't show ink bars anymore.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20051","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"perf(int-bar): Convert MatInkBarFoundation adapter to class o…\" (#20051)"},{"Id":"662371071","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-20T23:25:47","Actor":"Jordan-Hall","Number":"20050","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(drawer): add rail drawer support","State":"open","Body":"Add rail support for the drawer.\r\n\r\nAdded a new mode for drawer rail `mode=\"rail\"` inline with https://material.io/components/navigation-rail\r\n\r\nThis PR will resolve #1728 https://github.com/angular/components/issues/1728","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20050","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(drawer): add rail drawer support\" (#20050)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-07-24T05:30:05.371167Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3318}

function","State":"open","Body":"Includes the following changes that are necessary to generate the HMR update function:\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): account for new replaceMetadata signature\r\nUpdates the runtime code to account for the upcoming changes to `ɵɵreplaceMetadata`.\r\n\r\nI also had to reorganize how the `angularCoreEnv` was set up, because `ɵɵreplaceMetadata` needs access to it without triggering a circular dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): output AST visitor not visiting implicit arrow function returns\r\nFixes that the output AST's `RecursiveVisitor` wasn't visiting all the nodes when an arrow function has an implicit return. The problem was that we were calling the `visitExpression` method directly, instead of `.visitExpression`. This doesn't affect existing code since the `RecursiveVisitor` isn't used anywhere, but it will affect future HMR code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): allow namespace import identifiers to be rewritten\r\nCurrently only the prefix of namespace imports is configurable, but for HMR we need to know ahead of time what the name of `@angular/core` will be. These changes allow us to rewrite it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): generate HMR update function \r\nAdds some code to the compiler that will generate the HMR update callback function definition.\r\n\r\n### feat(compiler-cli): generate the HMR replacement module\r\nAdds the ability to generate the function that replaces the component's metadata during HMR. The HMR update module is a function that is loaded dynamically and as such it has some special considerations:\r\n* It isn't bundled, because doing so will result in multiple versions of core.\r\n* Since it isn't bundled, all dependencies have to be passed in as parameters. These changes include some special logic to determine and output those dependencies.\r\n* While HMR is enabled, we have to disable the functionality that generates dynamic imports and drop the dependencies inside `@defer` blocks, because we need to retain the ability to refer to them in case they're needed inside the HMR update function.\r\n* The function is returned by the `NgCompiler` as a string for the CLI's sake.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58205","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add HMR update function\" (#58205)"},{"Id":"2587487573","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-15T12:52:28","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"58200","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): Promote `takeUntilDestroyed` to stable.","State":"closed","Body":"`takeUntilDestroyed` is now part of the public API.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/58200","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(core): Promote `takeUntilDestroyed` to stable.\" (#58200)"},{"Id":"2586091347","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-15T12:08:56","Actor":"devversion","Number":"58191","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(migrations): improve heuristic of untyped `.componentInstance` in signal migrations","State":"closed","Body":"We currently extend `.componentInstance` accesses (which are `any` for `DebugElement`).

It also occurs sometimes during regular builds/`ng test`, especially when other concurrent jobs put load on the system.\r\n\r\nBy adding lots and lots of logging, I found the root cause, which is a race condition when the sass worker manages to call `findFileUrl` again in between `Atomics.store(..., 0, 1)` and `Atomics.notify(..., 0)` invocations - I left more details as a comment.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe race no longer causes failing builds. After being notified, the worker checks again that the signal is not set to 0, and waits for another `notify` if necessary, which will be the correct one.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the new behavior that. -->\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\nI verified that the second `Atomics.wait(..., 0, 0)` actually does something meaningful, by logging the return value. Under load, I observed two instances where the return value was `\"ok\"`, indicating that the signal was 0 at the time of the second `wait`, and the build would therefore have aborted without the change.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28630","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): avoid race condition in sass importer\" (#28630)"},{"Id":"2587670233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-15T16:24:30","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28635","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.26.13","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.26.12` -> `v3.26.13` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.26.13`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.26.12...v3.26.13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.26.12...v3.26.13)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[`v1.79.5`](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1795)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.79.4...1.79.5)\n\n-   Changes to how `selector.unify()` and `@extend` combine selectors:\n\n    -   The relative order of pseudo-classes (like `:hover`) and pseudo-elements\n        (like `::before`) within each original selector is now preserved when\n        they're combined.\n\n    -   Pseudo selectors are now consistently placed at the end of the combined\n        selector, regardless of which selector they came from. Previously, this\n        reordering only applied to pseudo-selectors in the second selector.\n\n-   Tweak the color transformation matrices for OKLab and OKLCH to match the\n    newer, more accurate values in the CSS spec.\n\n-   Fix a slight inaccuracy case when converting to `srgb-linear` and\n    `display-p3`.\n\n-   **Potentially breaking bug fix:** `math.unit()` now wraps multiple denominator\n    units in parentheses. For example, `px/(em*em)` instead of `px/em*em`.\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Use `@parcel/watcher` to watch the filesystem when running from JavaScript and\n    not using `--poll`. This should mitigate more frequent failures users have\n    been seeing since version 4.0.0 of Chokidar, our previous watching tool, was\n    released.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Fix `SassColor.interpolate()` to allow an undefined `options` parameter, as\n    the types indicate.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Properly pass missing color channel values to and from custom functions.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

More specifically, we want to use this to create harnesses for web components, some of which will then end up being used in Angular applications.\nWe've created our own implementation of these types and we're trying to make these compatible with Angular types so that the web component library can use the non-Angular version but these harnesses can then still be used in Angular ComponentHarnesses.\n\nWe've nearly gotten to the point where everything works, there's only one thing we cannot resolve: the `HarnessQuery` used in the `LocatorFactory` interface's functions references the `HarnessPredicate` class which has private properties.\nThis makes \"our\" version of HarnessQuery and the Angular version inherently incompatible according to typescript.\n\nThis could be a small change, e.g. limiting the type in `HarnessQuery` to only the required properties:\n\n```diff\n export type HarnessQuery<T extends ComponentHarness> =\n   | ComponentHarnessConstructor<T>\n-  | HarnessPredicate<T>;\n+  | Pick<HarnessPredicate<T>, 'getDescription' | 'getSelector' | 'harnessType'>\n```\n\nand in the `harness-environment.ts` file use a new function instead of `query instanceof HarnessPredicate`\n\n```ts\nfunction isHarnessPredicate<T extends ComponentHarness>(value: HarnessQuery<T>): value is Pick<HarnessPredicate<T>, 'getDescription' | 'getSelector' | 'harnessType'> {\n  return 'harnessType' in value;\n}\n```\n\n### Use Case\n\nAs mentioned above, we want to use the component harness concept in a non-Angular context and we want those harnesses to be compatible with harnesses written using the CDK and the CDK's harness environments.\n\nAn alternative solution could be to extract part of `@angular/cdk/testing` into a separate package that doesn't have any dependencies to the Angular framework. That way we wouldn't have to maintain our own copy of these types/classes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29860","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(cdk/testing): be more lenient in HarnessQuery\" (#29860)"},{"Id":"2579310664","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-10T17:25:23","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29857","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/core): rename theme mixin","State":"closed","Body":"Renamed `mat.private-experimental-theme` to just `mat.theme`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29857","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material/core): rename theme mixin\" (#29857)"},{"Id":"2578802619","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-10T15:28:28","Actor":"naiduraa","Number":"29855","RawContent":null,"Title":"Chips: disabled chips is receiving focus","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n<mat-chip-listbox aria-label=\"Fish selection\">\n  <mat-chip-option>One fish</mat-chip-option>\n  <mat-chip-option>Two fish</mat-chip-option>\n  <mat-chip-option>Three fish</mat-chip-option>\n  <mat-chip-option disabled>Four fish</mat-chip-option>\n</mat-chip-listbox>\n\nThe disabled chips receives focus\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/xbnwf3?file=src%2Fexample%2Fchips-overview-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

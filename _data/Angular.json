are handled by #60531 \r\n\r\nThe side pane might require a more thorough refactoring but this change should stabilize the UI for now.\r\n\r\ncc @dgp1130 \r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking

buildtime when you migrate to new control flow and keep ng-container","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nlocalize\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nNote: I do not know if this is a regression or has been there forever.\n\nWe recently started migrating our Angular project at work over to the\nnew control-flow syntax (@if and @for) using the provided angular\nmigration for it.\n\nThis migrated a few of our pieces of code that looked like this:\n```html\n<div i18n=\"@@some-key\">\n   Text A\n   <ng-container *ngIf=\"bool\">\n     Text B\n   </ng-container>\n</div>\n```\nTo look like this:\n```html\n<div i18n=\"@@some-key\">\n   Text A\n   @if(bool){\n     Text B\n   }\n</div>\n```\nThis **correctly** breaks at build-time/when you try to ng-serve your\napplication as the content of @@some-key no longer is the same, the\nplaceholders changed from START_NG_CONTAINER etc. to START_BLOCK_IF etc. .\n\nNot understanding the problem, we just added ng-container back in the\nhope that this alleviates the problem:\n```html\n<div i18n=\"@@some-key\">\n   Text A\n   @if(bool){\n     <ng-container>\n       Text B\n     </ng-container>\n   }\n</div>\n```\nThis **incorrectly** will run with ng-serve despite the fact that the\ncontent of @@some-key still changed, as START_BLOCK_IF were added to the\ncontents!\n\nWhat you instead will see are runtime errors of various ilks about how\nNodes can't be inserted into the DOM, expressed through various different exceptions depending on the scenario.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nhook.js:608 ERROR

coverage is no longer accurate\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nGenerate a new app with latest CLI and add a component:\n\n```\nnpx @angular/cli@20.0.0-next.6 new aot-coverage --defaults --no-routing\ncd aot-coverage\nng g c user\n```\n\nUse app-user in app.html:\n```html\n<h1>Hello, aot-coverage</h1>\n<app-user></app-user>\n```\n\nEdit angular.json to add \"aot\": true in the test section and run:\n```\nng test --no-watch --code-coverage\n```\n\nCoverage is 100%\n```\nStatements   : 100% ( 12/12 )\nBranches     : 100% ( 11/11 )\nFunctions    : 100% ( 3/3 )\nLines        : 100% ( 6/6 )\n```\n\nNow, in the app.spec.ts, add in `beforeEach`:\n\n```ts\nTestBed.overrideComponent(App, {\n  remove: {\n    imports: [User],\n  },\n  add: {\n    imports: [User],\n  }\n});\n```\n\n(this happens with a proper stub of course but even removing the import and adding it back works to reproduce the issue)\n\nRun the tests again:\n\n```\nng test --no-watch --code-coverage\n```\n\nCoverage is now inaccurate:\n```\nStatements   : 58.33% ( 7/12 )\nBranches     : 90.9% ( 10/11 )\nFunctions    : 66.66% ( 2/3 )\nLines        : 66.66% ( 4/6 )\n```\n\n###

Those browser artifacts might contain files with spaces. This is incompatible with the Bazel version we are using, so the inprocess runfile creation was a workaround for this— If we remove that flag, we might cause issues for Mac users.\r\n\r\nWe have a few options I think:\r\n\r\n1. drop the flag, and hope it doesn't break any runfile generation for browsers. I suspect it won't work...— alternatively try renaming browser files.\r\n\r\n2. keep the flag for now, and temporarily keep the disabled FS patches (needs to be manually specified by users)\r\n\r\n3. do solution (2) but once migration allows it, update to Bazel 7— so that the bug with inprocess resolution is nicely fixed.\r\n\r\nI think (3) is a good plan moving forward and we don't need any runfile tricks. In Bazel 8, the runfiles with space issue is also resolved— allowing us to drop the inprocess runfile creation as well (if we want).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30119","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: fix `bazel run` invocations of `js_binary/js_test`\" (#30119)"},{"Id":"2998911260","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:17:46","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30113","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): pass `preserveSymlinks` option to Karma esbuild builder","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nEnsure that several previously omitted options are correctly passed to the Karma esbuild builder, improving consistency and expected behavior.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30113","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): pass `preserveSymlinks` option to Karma esbuild builder\" (#30113)"},{"Id":"2999971186","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:16:35","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30118","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.8 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30118","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.8 release\" (#30118)"},{"Id":"2999813410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:13:22","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30117","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30117","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.8\" with changelog.\" (#30117)"},{"Id":"2999379499","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T11:42:38","Actor":"geromegrignon","Number":"30116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enhance ng new boilerplate with a Signal example","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Description\n\nA similar way React CRA app has a counter button in the initial boilerplate, doing quite the same for Angular `ng new` AppComponent boilerplate could be a good opportunity to promote Signals.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n\nBased on the current boilerplate content, it could be a 'like' button, each click incrementing a related counter.\n\nIt would be a simple way to show a basic Signal usage, even if deleted after all.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhance ng new boilerplate with a Signal example\" (#30116)"},{"Id":"2999068602","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T09:39:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30115","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: minor code changes in karma `AngularAssetsMiddleware`","State":"open","Body":"Early exits and reduce optional chaining.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30115","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: minor code changes in karma `AngularAssetsMiddleware`\" (#30115)"},{"Id":"2998803026","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T08:43:03","Actor":"timothyBrake","Number":"30111","RawContent":null,"Title":"HMR Triggers Full Page Reload When Using i18n in HTML Template","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using Angular with Vite for development, Hot Module Replacement (HMR) works as expected for standard HTML templates. However, if an i18n attribute is present in the template (e.g., `<h1 i18n=\"@@greetings\">Title</h1>`), editing the template triggers a full page reload instead of a hot update. This negates the benefits of HMR and slows down the development workflow.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Run commands\n\n```\nng new my-i18n-app\ncd my-i18n-app\nng add @angular/localize\nng serve\n```\n\n2. In Chrome navigate to\n[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)\n\n3.

But if the behavior of it is not intended, it would be a bug.\n\n### TL;DR\n\nUsing angular-vite and server routes: Is it intended that the AppInitializer function is called on the server side even if I have set all Routes to be RenderMode.Client?\n\n### Issue / Question\n\nI have a nx monorepo where I have multiple angular apps. Some of them use server side rendering, some not. Based on the old SSR approach, I have different server implementations for those apps. Now with the ServerRoutes I thought of unifying the server part for those apps.\n\nHaving the apps with SSR being configured this way:\n```typescript\nexport const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [\n  {\n    path: '**',\n    renderMode: RenderMode.Server\n  }\n];\n```\nand the apps that do not support SSR set to:\n```typescript\nexport const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [\n  {\n    path: '**',\n    renderMode: RenderMode.Client\n  }\n];\n```\nWhile this works in general, I have an issue with the apps, that are client side rendered. When I start the '@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server' and load the app for the first time, the function I pass to 'provideAppInitializer' is exectued on the server. I get the outputs to the server logs. For all consecutive calls, it's not exectued anymore.\nThis is an issue for me, because the AppInitializer function throws an error on the server side. So whenever I start the server, I get an erorr, before it then actually works fine.\n\nNow the easy workaround would be to just check in the AppInitializer if the code is running on server side and if so, just abort (because the app seems not to be bootstrapped further than the AppInitializer, this works fine).\nBut I thought I am first gonna ask here, if this is even the intended behavior or if this is considered a bug and should actually be fixed.\n\nExample on how the AppInitializer of my client side rendered app might look:\n```typescript\n    provideAppInitializer(() => {\n      console.log('This will be logged to the dev-server-console once on first load of the page');\n    }),\n```\n\n\nIf you need a reproduction, just let me know, then I'll create a small app with the most current angular version. 😄 \nThanks for any feedback, even if you tell me that my use case is too niche.\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng

response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello, I've came upon this bug while trying to migrate to the new application builder. \nAs far as I understand, the old webpack based builder provided polyfills by default but the new one doesn't.\n\nWe are using the `crypto` node js package which was polyfilled in the old builder to `crypto-browserify` and that also has a dependency inside `stream` which was also polyfilled making the package work without problems.\n\nAfter migrating to the new builder, the polyfills didn't work, neither with the dev server or the normal builder.\n\nI looked around and found out that you need to provide the `browser` field in the `package.json` to the esbuild based builder, so I've did that and the errors are gone when I build the application host it with something like `python3 -m http.server 8080`.\n\nThe problem is that since the dev server is using vite, the error is still present there, it's not handling the dependency aliasing from the `browser` field,  which causes the package call I have fail because of the missing dependency.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI've made a [repo](https://github.com/robertkocsis/vite-dev-server-bug) to reproduce the issue:\n\ncheck out the repo\n\n`npm run install`\n\n`npm start`\n\n\nOpen `localhost:4200` , go to the console and see that there is a failing function call because a dependency is undefined\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/732a9343-0400-4b71-a138-6ec4f795643a)\n\nSee that Transform here is supposed to come from the `stream` dependency:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/494586e0-40b4-4cce-97a7-f6c84e143266)\n\nThere is also all these logs in the console \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f219254-9756-4e50-92e8-b10df000240e)\n\n\nclose the dev server\n\n`npm run build`\n\ncreate a small http server from with the contents of the `dist/browser`, I've used this: `python3 -m http.server 8080`, but you can also use nginx etc.\n\nopen the browser and see that the function calls work in the console.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7792759e-e819-42b5-b050-264b219d3667)\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nI've created a new repo here and I'm using the latest

However, when using the StartDelay configuration, there is no event or mechanism to detect when dragging becomes possible after the delay completes but before movement begins. This leads to a gap in functionality where developers cannot hook into the moment dragging becomes active.\n\nSuggested Solution\nIntroduce an additional event (e.g., cdkDragActivated) that fires once the StartDelay has elapsed and dragging becomes possible, regardless of movement. This would enable more granular control and improve the developer experience when working with delayed drag-and-drop functionality.\n\n\nRelated Code/Documentation\nThe cdkDragStarted event: [Drag and Drop Documentation](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview#drag-and-drop)\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis feature would be particularly useful for scenarios where UI feedback or logic needs to occur as soon as dragging is activated (after the delay), but before the user moves the draggable item.\n\nFor example the user wants to indicate that a element is now draggable with an outline.

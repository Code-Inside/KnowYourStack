When I convert this component to a standalone component, my tests fail with NG0300 but the new component works fine in the application. I'm assuming I am doing something wrong in configuring the testing module or that there is some bug in it but I'm unable to find documentation covering this case. The full component:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Input, Component, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { NgFor, NgIf, NgClass } from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\nexport interface Node {\r\n  cssClasses?: string;\r\n  text?: string;\r\n  nodes?: Node[];\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: '[app-nester]',\r\n  template: `<ng-container *ngFor=\"let node of nodes\">\r\n    <ng-container>\r\n      <ng-container *ngIf=\"node.text as text\">\r\n        <div [ngClass]=\"node.cssClasses!\">{{ text }}</div>\r\n      </ng-container>\r\n      <ng-container *ngIf=\"node.nodes as nodes\">\r\n        <div [ngClass]=\"node.cssClasses!\" app-nester [nodes]=\"node.nodes\"></div>\r\n      </ng-container>\r\n    </ng-container>\r\n  </ng-container> `,\r\n  // standalone: true,\r\n  // imports: [NgFor, NgIf, NgClass, forwardRef(() => NesterComponent)],\r\n})\r\nexport class NesterComponent {\r\n  @Input() nodes: Node[] | null = null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto convert to standalone I used the new migration and it added these commented out lines and imports.\r\n\r\nMy Tests:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { ComponentFixture, TestBed, waitForAsync } from '@angular/core/testing';\r\n\r\nimport { NesterComponent } from './nester.component';\r\n\r\ndescribe('NesterComponent', () => {\r\n  let component: NesterComponent;\r\n  let fixture: ComponentFixture<NesterComponent>;\r\n\r\n  // remove for standalone version\r\n  beforeEach(waitForAsync(() => {\r\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({ declarations: [NesterComponent] }).compileComponents();\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n  // standalone version from migration:\r\n  // beforeEach(waitForAsync(() => {\r\n  //   TestBed.configureTestingModule({ imports: [NesterComponent] }).compileComponents();\r\n  // }));\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(() => {\r\n    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(NesterComponent);\r\n    component = fixture.componentInstance;\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should create', () => {\r\n    expect(component).toBeDefined();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should render text', () => {\r\n    component.nodes = [\r\n      { cssClasses: 'test1', text: 'test1' },\r\n      {\r\n        cssClasses: 'test2',\r\n        nodes: [{ cssClasses: 'not in result' }, { text: 'test4' }],\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        cssClasses: 'test5',\r\n        nodes: [],\r\n      },\r\n    ];\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n    expect(fixture.nativeElement).toMatchSnapshot();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain in this case all the migration did was change `declarations` to `imports`\r\n\r\nThe above functions and test passes... however if I switch it to the standalone version of both files then the test fails (as far as I can tell it still works though, this is just a test problem).\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```\r\nFAIL  src/app/shared/nester/nester.component.spec.ts (13.262 s)\r\n  NesterComponent\r\n    √ should create (322 ms)\r\n    × should render text (826 ms)\r\n\r\n  ● NesterComponent › should render text\r\n\r\n    NG0300: Multiple components match node with tagname div: NesterComponent and NesterComponent.

I have a small component, thet fetches the data based on route param. The observable, that holds the data stream is turned into signal by utilizing toSignal helper.

running test in a fakeAsync.\r\n\r\n## The component\r\n\r\n```js\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'page-product',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  templateUrl: './product.component.html',\r\n  imports:

by composed directive ","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIf a directive (let's named it `ReusableDirective`) exposes a required input (`foo`), and is used as a host directive by another directive (`ComposedDirective`), then the compiler forces the composed directive to expose the required input. \r\n\r\nThis is problematic when the whole point of the composed directive is precisely to provide a default or computed value for the required input. \r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[app-reusable]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n})\r\nclass ReusableDirective {\r\n  @Input({ required: true }) foo!: string;\r\n\r\n  // do something useful with foo here, but that's irrelevant\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[app-composed]',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  hostDirectives: [ReusableDirective],\r\n})\r\nclass ComposedDirective {\r\n  constructor(reusable: ReusableDirective) {\r\n    reusable.foo = 'hello';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-85nxmu?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations,%20@angular/common,%20@angular/compiler,%20@angular/core,%20@angular/forms,%20@angular/platform-browser,%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic,%20@angular/router,%20core-js,%20rxjs,%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fmain.ts&title=Angular%20Starter\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequired input 'foo' from host directive ReusableDirective must be exposed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you

and we have several custom `fooTypeahead` and `barTypeahead` directives which simply use ngbTypeahead as a host directive and provide this required input.

The application works fine without the \"optimization\" flag set to true in the angular.json file. But when set to true, some code remains in the main....js that causes an error, when the page gets loaded.\r\nThe console log states \"main.bc110eb6fa951c13.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: hd is not defined\". \r\nHere is the part of the code, that causes this issue:\r\n\r\n`class EP extends hd {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation (and also turning off the optimization flag), I found out that this code originally looked like that:\r\n\r\n`\r\nclass ReferenceExpr extends ExpressionBase {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nSo the ExpressionBase class is missing. Which is also fine, I guess, since it is not used in the code and hence was removed by tree shaking. Also the ReferenceExpr class is, as far as I can tell, not used in the code.

At the time I started, what I was thinking of was specific to a set of tables I intended to use in an administrative context, so I navigated to something like /src/modules/sales/costing-tool/components/templates and typed \"ng g c admin-table\". \r\n\r\nBefore I hit enter, I thought about it and decided that rather than creating a module and specific use component that I'd rather make a general use component for generating p-tables dynamically & that it belonged in a shared module rather than a feature module. I thought I'd already deleted the CLI command out of the terminal so without looking I typed cd.. and hit enter. Which was the beginning of a 2+ hour headache that ended up costing me 2 days of work and which potentially could've cost me all the work I've done since May 5. \r\n\r\nSo the command I effectively entered was \"ng g c admin-tablecd..\", and what happened is that the CLI was able to somehow dodge the OS level naming safety conventions & it created a folder named admin-tablecd.., which caused there to be an unresolvable reference in my project structure and made it unloadable and unbuildable. And there was nothing I could do to delete the offending folder.

E.g. if the \"end\" value is currently 9, then a user can only move the \"start\" thumb as high as 8.\r\n\r\nI'm enforcing it by subscribing to `valueChanges` of the form controls associated with the slider input elements.\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.start.valueChanges.subscribe(() => {\r\n  if (this.start.value >= this.end.value) {\r\n    this.start.setValue(this.end.value - 1, { emitEvent: false });\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nEven though the code above guarantees the form control values satisfy the constraint, the underlying DOM `input` element doesn't reflect the programmatic change from the `setValue` call.\r\n\r\nA workaround I'm currently using is injecting the `input` elements (via `@ViewChild`) and setting its `.value` directly.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/benvwf-lmrtl4?file=src%2Fexample%2Fslider-range-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

It seemed appropriate to pull from the Material spec for these.  The use of \"Large body text\" and \"Medium body text\" is meant to help bridge the gap to the eventual shift to M3, since those type levels equate to [M3's Large and Medium body text](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/type-scale-tokens#d74b73c2-ac5d-43c5-93b3-088a2f67723d), respectively. \r\n\r\nI also tweaked the second table to give greater emphasis to the class names that match the typography levels when more than one class is mapped to a style.

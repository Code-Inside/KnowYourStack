hydrated in the server.","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nplatform-browser, platform-server\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nFirst of all, a huge thanks for your continuous efforts in improving SSR and with this new non-destructive hydration feature.\r\n\r\nWe've been exploring this new feature and have seen promising results. However, we have encounter a big challenge when trying to integrate it with the server hydration of Web Components, specifically with Stencil.\r\n\r\nOur Angular components are predominantly composed of elements from our Stencil components library. To improve rendering and mitigate flickering of the Web Components, we've been pre-rendering them using Stencil’s `renderToString` method for server-side hydration. This approach has been effective until now but seems incompatible with Angular's non-destructive hydration. The method takes the entire generated HTML (result from Angular SSR rendering) and renders the Web Components, producing a new full HTML page, which certainly modifies the DOM and triggers the [NG0500](https://angular.io/errors/NG0500) Hydration error. \r\n\r\nWe understand that the ideal would be to avoid the DOM manipulation and for that, it would be needed to have some kind of per-component hydration method in Stencil which I think is not available at the moment, and wouldn't be too easy to implement.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that a potential resolution might involve implementing a specific hydration method in the Stencil Angular wrapper, allowing hydration via Angular's DOM renderer functions instead of direct HTML generation. However, I think this wouldn't be easy and might essentially be like implementing a full Stencil to Angular compiler rather than just a wrapper.\r\n\r\nI these solutions are not possible, we would have to skip the hydration of all the web components with `ngSkipHydration` but I think that doesn't solve the issue and by doing this, we would be losing most of the advantages of having the client hydration. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the main issues we are encountering now and preventing us of enabling the non-destructive hydration with `provideClientHydration`. \r\n\r\nWhile I understand that this might not be a direct issue with Angular and the new hydration feature, any guidance on how this might be resolved or mitigated would be very valuable. Also, I was wondering if there might be a way to facilitate collaboration with Stencil or other Web Component libraries to propose a solution. Actually, are you aware if this issue has been addressed in some way in Lit, or is there a possibility for collaboration with that team?\r\n\r\nI've created this [Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angular-ssr-ap-r3s9vc) to reproduce the problem and it would be useful for exploring potential solutions as it hosts the Stencil components in the same environment.\r\n(It should run well on first load, or it can be downloaded as well and run with `./start.sh` script. Basically, it install and build the Stencil components and the Angular wrapper, and then the Angular SSR server)\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this issue, and we look forward to any insights or suggestions you might have.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angular-ssr-ap-r3s9vc\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: NG0500: During hydration Angular expected a text node but found a comment node.\r\n\r\nAngular expected this DOM:\r\n\r\n<my-component _ngcontent-ng-c2448950787=\"\" class=\"hydrated\">\r\n  #text(Click here)  <-- AT THIS LOCATION\r\n  …\r\n</my-component>\r\n\r\nActual DOM is:\r\n\r\n<my-component _ngcontent-ng-c2448950787=\"\" class=\"hydrated\">\r\n  <!--  -->  <-- AT THIS LOCATION\r\n  …\r\n</my-component>\r\n\r\nNote: attributes are only displayed to better represent the DOM but have no effect on hydration mismatches.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem:\r\n  * check the \"AppComponent\" component for hydration-related issues\r\n  * check to see if your template has valid HTML structure\r\n  * or skip hydration by adding the `ngSkipHydration` attribute to its host node in a template\r\n\r\n Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0500\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.2.1\r\nNode: 18.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.1\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for client hydration for Web Components hydrated in the server.\" (#52275)"},{"Id":"1950700294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-18T21:31:31","Actor":"Ameerw04","Number":"52274","RawContent":null,"Title":"by mistake","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I keep running into a `runtime error` (not a compile error) in my large angular app:\r\n`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ...)`.   I often get it when I try to re-structure files.\r\n\r\n(Not sure if this is an angular cli issue... a webpack issue.. or both.. but if nothing else... a better error would be great)\r\n\r\nI've narrowed it down to the fact that I have been `barrel-rolling` my features and directories in my libraries...\r\nFor example:\r\n```js\r\n// myLib/features/user/index.ts\r\nexport * from './api/af-user.api';\r\nexport * from './af-user.manager';\r\nexport * from './af-user-initials.pipe';\r\n```\r\nand one of my components in a different part of the lib is importing the pipe.\r\n```js\r\n// myLib/shared/ui/af-user-avatar.component.ts\r\nimport { AfUserInitialsPipe } from '../../features/user';   // <--- BREAKS (at runtime, NOT on compile)\r\nimport { AfUserInitialsPipe } from '../../features/user/af-user-initials.pipe';  // <--- WORKS\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I import from `../../features/user` (the default import) the app successfully compiles... but wont run....\r\nIf I import directly from the file... its fine.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming because the `../../features/user` import also pulls in the other items exported in the user feature and something is coming full circle  (circular dependency?)\r\n\r\nI've been barrel-rolling like mad... because I really liked the pattern when I saw it... and thought most people do it..  but now I'm feeling like I need to remove all the barrel rolls and just deal with individual imports ect... because everytime this occurs... its a 1-2 hour nightmare of trying to find out which import is causing it... (because the error it generates sucks)\r\n\r\nWhat's worse... is that the compiler succeeds... so you can be doing work for a couple hours... then when you run it... its broken... and you have to scour all your code changes to try and figure out whats wrong.\r\n\r\nHere's the full error for the current issue.... you'll notice it doesnt even show `af-user-avatar` in the error.\r\n```\r\naf-api-utils.service.ts:18 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'AfApiRest')\r\n    at Module.AfApiRest (af-api-utils.service.ts:18:33)\r\n    at 15693 (af-user.api.ts:7:32)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:24:1)\r\n    at fn (hot module replacement:62:1)\r\n    at 35421 (af-user.api.ts:6:33)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:24:1)\r\n    at fn (hot module replacement:62:1)\r\n    at 3806 (af-table-basic.component.ts:24:25)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyone have thought on barrel-rolling... or do-and-don'ts....\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'AfApiRest')\r\n    at Module.AfApiRest (af-api-utils.service.ts:18:33)\r\n    at 15693 (af-user.api.ts:7:32)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:24:1)\r\n    at fn (hot module replacement:62:1)\r\n    at 35421 (af-user.api.ts:6:33)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:24:1)\r\n    at fn (hot module replacement:62:1)\r\n    at 3806 (af-table-basic.component.ts:24:25)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:24:1)\r\n    at fn (hot module replacement:62:1)\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nNode   : 18.13.0\r\n   OS     : win32-x64\r\n   npm    : 9.8.0\r\n\r\n   nx                 : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/js             : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/jest           : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/linter         : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/workspace      : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/angular        : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/cypress        : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/devkit         : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/eslint-plugin  : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/express        : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/node           : 16.8.1\r\n   @nrwl/tao          : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/web            : 16.8.1\r\n   @nx/webpack        : 16.8.1\r\n   nx-cloud           : 16.4.0\r\n   typescript         : 5.1.5\r\n   ---------------------------------------\r\n   Community plugins:\r\n   @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome : 0.13.0\r\n   @ngrx/component-store            : 16.0.0\r\n   @ngrx/effects                    : 16.0.0\r\n   @ngrx/entity                     : 16.0.0\r\n   @ngrx/router-store               : 16.0.0\r\n   @ngrx/store                      : 16.0.0\r\n   @ngrx/store-devtools             : 16.0.0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nim running nx... i've also posted this in their angular help forum.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the hard work..

This release adjusts esbuild's behavior for this edge case so that it passes while still processing aliases before `--packages=external`. Please read the linked issue for more details.\n\n-   Fix a CSS `font` property minification bug ([#&#8203;3452](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3452))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild's CSS minifier didn't insert a space between the font size and the font family in the `font` CSS shorthand property in the edge case where the original source code didn't already have a space and the leading string token was shortened to an identifier:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .foo { font: 16px\"Menlo\"; }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    .foo{font:16pxMenlo}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    .foo{font:16px Menlo}\n    ```\n\n-   Fix bundling CSS with asset names containing spaces ([#&#8203;3410](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3410))\n\n    Assets referenced via CSS `url()` tokens may cause esbuild to generate invalid output when bundling if the file name contains spaces (e.g. `url(image 2.png)`). With this release, esbuild will now quote all bundled asset references in `url()` tokens to avoid this problem. This only affects assets loaded using the `file` and `copy` loaders.\n\n-   Fix invalid CSS `url()` tokens in `@import` rules ([#&#8203;3426](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3426))\n\n    In the future, CSS `url()` tokens may contain additional stuff after the URL. This is irrelevant today as no CSS specification does this. But esbuild previously had a bug where using these tokens in an `@import` rule resulted in malformed output. This bug has been fixed.\n\n-   Fix `browser` + `false` + `type: module` in `package.json` ([#&#8203;3367](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3367))\n\n    The `browser` field in `package.json` allows you to map a file to `false` to have it be treated as an empty file when bundling for the browser. However, if `package.json` contains `\"type\": \"module\"` then all `.js` files will be considered ESM, not CommonJS. Importing a named import from an empty CommonJS file gives you undefined, but importing a named export from an empty ESM file is a build error. This release changes esbuild's interpretation of these files mapped to `false` in this situation from ESM to CommonJS to avoid generating build errors for named imports.\n\n-   Fix a bug in top-level await error reporting ([#&#8203;3400](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3400))\n\n    Using `require()` on a file that contains [top-level await](https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await) is not allowed because `require()` must return synchronously and top-level await makes that impossible. You will get a build error if you try to bundle code that does this with esbuild. This release fixes a bug in esbuild's error reporting code for complex cases of this situation involving multiple levels of imports to get to the module containing the top-level await.\n\n-   Update to Unicode 15.1.0\n\n    The character tables that determine which characters form valid JavaScript identifiers have been updated from Unicode version 15.0.0 to the newly-released Unicode version 15.1.0. I'm not putting an example in the release notes because all of the new characters will likely just show up as little squares since fonts haven't been updated yet. But you can read https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.1.0/#Summary for more information about the changes.\n\n    This upgrade was contributed by [@&#8203;JLHwung](https://togithub.com/JLHwung).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

But on the next step I get a massive list of errors that are difficult to understand. This is after I added angular universal with nestjs to my application. Then if I try to access my application page (yes I changed the port to 4200 and am using the right one) it just says 'localhost refused to connect'.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a new angular project\r\n2. Add @nestjs/ng-universal package using ng-cli\r\n3. Run the application\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n`Initial Chunk Files | Names         |  Raw Size\r\nvendor.js           | vendor        |   5.39 MB | \r\nmain.js             | main

I'm putting a ticket here and officially with Heroku in hopes one of the two services in question understands what the issue is, and whether it's with their service (or more likely) with incorrect configuration on my end.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance -- first time using Angular Universal, and it's also my first time deploying to Heroku. Both seemed easy when I was testing them individually, but combining them for this project has been... aging.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate angular universal app and attempt to deploy it to Heroku using Heroku CLI.\r\n\r\nI build my projects, then deploy them to heroku. I do not add an explicit build step or package installation step within my `npm run start`, as I believe Heroku already handles these steps.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.6\r\nNode: 20.5.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.0\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.6\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.6\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n\r\nWarning: The current version of Node (20.5.0) is not supported by Angular.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n20.5.0 is the version of node that it installed for me.

Observe the animation is janky.\r\n\r\n#### Proof that `expansion-panel` is responsible:\r\n1. Delete the `<mat-expansion-panel>` element (and its children) from `example-component.html`.\r\n2. Reload (to force Angular to clear unused component styles).\r\n3. Observe the animation is now smooth.\r\n\r\n#### Proof that the `[style]` selector is responsible:\r\n1. Right-click > Inspect Element on \"expanstion panel contents\".\r\n3. In DevTools, ensure that `<div class=\"mat-expansion-panel-body\">` is selected.\r\n4. (optionally) Record a performance trace and observe that \"Recalculate Style\" affects 10,001 elements and takes a long time.\r\n5. Close the expansion panel.\r\n6. In DevTools, edit the CSS selector `.mat-expansion-panel-content[style*=\"visibility: hidden\"] *` to remove `[style*=...]`\r\n7. Observe the animation is now smooth.\r\n8. (optionally)  Record a performance trace and observe that \"Recalculate Style\" affects 1 element and is very fast.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe animation is smooth regardless of if an expansion panel exists or what the expansion panel component does internally.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe animation is smooth only after modifying an expansion-panel-internal CSS rule.\n\n### Environment\n\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.6\r\nNode: 19.9.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.6\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.8\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.6\r\n@angular/material               16.2.8\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27946","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(expansion-panel): `[style*=...]` attribute selector causes whole-page slowdown in Chromium\" (#27946)"},{"Id":"1942722694","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-13T22:26:56","Actor":"zarend","Number":"27943","RawContent":null,"Title":"snackbar testing","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27943","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"snackbar testing\" (#27943)"},{"Id":"1942107163","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-13T14:49:43","Actor":"pweyrich","Number":"27942","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(multiple): still support legacy components in v17","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27622 you've removed support for legacy components. This means, that once Angular v17 is out, one would be forced to use the mdc-based components only.\r\n\r\nWhile this might have been a reasonable choice for your team - also conforming to your update and deprecation policies - there are codebases out there (including ours) that haven't migrated to the new components yet.\r\nReasons for that are probably diverse, but one major reasons for us was the knowledge about your efforts on eventually offering a brand-new token-based theming API.\r\n\r\nWe work on a bigger enterprise grade application with a design system that's based on customized material components. Due to limited official support for customizations on the current theming API (as of v16 with legacy components) , we tend to override a lot of (global) component styles.\r\nWhile eagerly waiting for the new token-based theming API to evolve and stabilize, we hoped to have the chance to upgrade directly to this new theming API, component by component.\r\nWith the discontinued support of legacy components in v17 however, this is now impossible and our migration path to the mdc-based components is very steep (either high effort or high risk).\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nI can only see 2 options for us to move forward right now:\r\n\r\n1. While staying on v16, migrate each legacy component to the new mdc-based ones, component by component. This will require us to integrate with a new but still not latest theming API of the mdc-components first. After that migration is completed we would upgrade to v17 and have to re-integrate with the latest theming API once more, resulting in doubled theme integration effort. (high effort)\r\n2. Upgrade to v17 and migrate to mdc-based components at the same time. This would require us to migrate all components at once, which would tremendously increase the risk of the migration. However, we would only need to integrate with the latest theming API once.

This type argument is forwarded in `open`. However, the type is never tied in anyway to the actual component, making the type argument an essentially useless type assertion.\r\n\r\nWhile due to the nature of Angular's dependency injection full type-safety cannot be achieved, it would be nice if at least the dialog component could declare the type it receives itself in such a way that a call to `open` will infer the correct type automatically. In order to achieve this, the dialog component needs to somehow expose this information. Here are a few possible solutions in no particular order, though others might exist:\r\n\r\n#### Interface with type inference\r\n\r\nWe could define an interface and a helper type as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface MatDialogHasData<T> {\r\n  data: T;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype ExtractDialogDataType<T> = T extends MatDialogHasData<infer D> ? D : any;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then adjust the type signature of `open` to infer the type accordingly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen<T, R = any>(\r\n  component: ComponentType<T>, \r\n  data?: MatDialogConfig<ExtractDialogDataType<T>>\r\n): MatDialogReg<T, R>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, a dialog component would be required to have a public field named `data` of the according type, which would typically be achieved through the injection itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconstructor(@Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public data: MyDialogDataType) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note*: This change _is_ breaking because the generic signature of `open` changes and because dialog components could have an unrelated `data` field which would lead to an unintended type inference. Unfortunately we cannot prevent this here due to TypeScript's structural typing nature. In particular users would no longer be able to manually define the generic type argument. Overall I think this is not a good solution.\r\n\r\n#### Interface with explicit method\r\n\r\nInstead, we could also introduce an interface with an explicit method to be implemented:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface MatDialogHasData<T> {\r\n  getDialogData(): T\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise the approach is largely similar. This change is only breaking in the generic type signature (I'm not sure whether you count this as a breaking change), however we could actually avoid that by changing our helper type to\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype ExtractDialogDataType<T, FALLBACK> = T extends MatDialogHasData<infer D> ? D : FALLBACK;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then using the type argument as a fallback:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen<T, D = any, R = any>(\r\n  component: ComponentType<T>, \r\n  data?: MatDialogConfig<ExtractDialogDataType<T, D>>\r\n): MatDialogReg<T, R>\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note*: The same could be done in the solution above, but there we have worse breakage anyway. Here I believe we could make this a completely backwards-compatible change, excluding of course the exotic situation that a component happens to already have a `getDialogData` method for unrelated reasons. The only disadvantage here is forcing the component to provide a public method. In practice I don't consider this a concern as Angular already forces us to make many things public that shouldn't be public from a component API perspective.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn a very similar note, it would be nice to have the same for the inferred result type `R`, i.e. the component being able to define the type of data it can return, and have this information flow through the `open` method to the caller. The approaches mentioned above could, in theory, cover this as well.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nGiven some `MyDialogComponent` which expects dialog data of type `MyDialogData`, I would like\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen(MyDialogComponent, {\r\n  data: {\r\n    // …\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nto type-check `data` against `MyDialogData` without having to manually specify `open`'s type arguments, but rather have this information flow from `MyDialogComponent`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/23985","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(dialog): Dialogs can define the type for their dialog data\" (#23985)"},{"Id":"1057729777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-18T19:39:03","Actor":"hisham","Number":"23984","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-selection-list): Two mat-selection-lists with same formControl are not in sync","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have two mat-selection-lists, in two different tab groups, referencing the same formControl. \r\n\r\nUpdates to the formControl via setValue correctly updates both lists. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I change the selection via one of the lists in the UI, the other list is not in sync, even though formControl underlying value does change. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSee https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-xptorw?file=src/app/app.component.html for reproduction. \r\n\r\nThey key code is as follows: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-selection-list [formControl]=\"myFormControl\">\r\n  <mat-list-option value=\"1\">Hello 1</mat-list-option>\r\n  <mat-list-option value=\"2\">Hello 2</mat-list-option>\r\n</mat-selection-list>\r\n\r\n<mat-selection-list [formControl]=\"myFormControl\">\r\n  <mat-list-option value=\"1\">Hello 1</mat-list-option>\r\n  <mat-list-option value=\"2\">Hello 2</mat-list-option>\r\n</mat-selection-list>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe two lists should be in sync as long as they are referencing the same value control. \r\n\r\nIf I subscribe to the selectionChange event in each list and implement the following workaround, they become in sync: \r\n\r\n```\r\n  public onSelectionChange($event: any) {\r\n    this.myFormControl.setValue(this.myFormControl.value);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe two lists are not in sync. \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 12.1.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 12.1.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/23984","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-selection-list): Two mat-selection-lists with same formControl are not in sync\" (#23984)"},{"Id":"1057695341","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-18T18:58:36","Actor":"Splaktar","Number":"23983","RawContent":null,"Title":"dev-infra: can't build project or run dev-app on MacBooks with m1 CPUs","State":"open","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nI've switched to an m1Max MacBook Pro as my main device now.\r\n\r\nI've got Bazel 4.2.1 installed locally, but the build seems to be trying to install Bazel 4.0.0 and failing.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 13 57 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3506071/142479285-bfda7541-602b-41d8-94f5-02ce392bb6b2.png)\r\n\r\n1.

I'm playing around with adding a component to replace textareas in my application by way of making a content editable div. I had to add some creative 'blur' events to get this working alright, but I noticed that whenever I made a change in my app it cleared out the binded field. When I turned off the HMR it properly updated the fields. I'm not 100% sure this is because of the editable content div, but maybe I'm not binding it the correct way?\n\nSince it says on the ng serve to report HMR errors I figured this might be helpful!\n\n**input-textarea.component.ts**\n\n```\nimport { Component, ElementRef, EventEmitter, HostListener, Input, Output, ViewChild, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ControlValueAccessor, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n\tselector: 'input-textarea',\n\ttemplateUrl: './input-textarea.component.html',\n\tstyleUrls: ['./input-textarea.component.scss'],\n\tproviders: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tprovide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\n\t\t\tuseExisting: forwardRef(() => InputTextareaComponent),\n\t\t\tmulti: true,\n\t\t},\n\t],\n\tstandalone: false,\n})\nexport class InputTextareaComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {\n\t@Input() placeholder: string = '';\n\t@Output() change: EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>();\n\n\t@ViewChild('editableDiv') editableDiv!: ElementRef<HTMLDivElement>;\n\tprivate originalValue: string = '';\n\tprivate dirty: boolean = false;\n\n\t// Required for ngModel two-way binding\n\tprivate onChange = (value: string) => {};\n\tprivate onTouched = () => {};\n\n\twriteValue(value: string): void {\n\t\tthis.originalValue = value || '';\n\t\tif (this.editableDiv) {\n\t\t\tthis.editableDiv.nativeElement.innerText = this.originalValue;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tregisterOnChange(fn: any): void {\n\t\tthis.onChange = fn;\n\t}\n\n\tregisterOnTouched(fn: any): void {\n\t\tthis.onTouched = fn;\n\t}\n\n\t// Triggered when the div loses focus\n\tonBlur(): void {\n\t\tif (!this.dirty) return;\n\t\tconst newValue = this.editableDiv.nativeElement.innerText.trim();\n\t\tif (newValue !== this.originalValue) {\n\t\t\tthis.originalValue = newValue;\n\t\t\tthis.onChange(newValue);\n\t\t\tthis.change.emit(newValue);\n\t\t}\n\t\tthis.dirty = false;\n\t}\n\n\tonTouch(): void {\n\t\tthis.dirty = true;\n\t}\n\n\t// Handle page refresh and navigation\n\t@HostListener('window:beforeunload', ['$event'])\n\thandleWindowEvents(): void {\n\t\tthis.onBlur();\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n\n**input-textarea.component.html**\n```\n<div #editableDiv contenteditable=\"plaintext-only\" class=\"input-textarea\" (blur)=\"onBlur()\" (focus)=\"onTouch()\" [attr.placeholder]=\"placeholder\"></div>\n```\n\n\n\n**input-textarea.component.scss**\n```\n:host {\n\tdisplay: block;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\theight: 100%;\n}\n\n.input-textarea {\n\twidth: 100%;\n\theight: 100%;\n\tfont-size: inherit;\n\twidth: inherit;\n\tborder: none;\n\tbackground: none;\n\tcursor: text;\n}\n```\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate the components from the code above, use it in another component somewhere binding a value using ngModel. For example:\n\n`<input-textarea [(ngModel)]=\"ticket.description\" (change)=\"updateTicket(ticket, 'description')\" />`\n\nRun with Component HMR turned on, make a change to the html or the css of the InputTextarea component, and the values are cleared out.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nNo exceptions in the console log\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nNode.js version v23.9.0 detected.\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

Something like this:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6998f786-097a-4fe3-a91f-e78457b526c2)\n\nPost MDC migration of our project, the selected options have started coming in blue color (mat-selected class getting added) which is fine. But since there is a custom function written for this clear-icon-click, although we set the control value to null/undefined and the value is updated properly in the control, still the selected classes are not getting removed. So, even if there is no option selected, the previously selected option still has the selected classes, when dropdown is opened. I used the hideSingleSelectionIndicator, hence tick is not present.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1736f4b7-3c57-43f5-819e-5d6ada9d6b0e)\n\nTo counter this, I used the below code in my clear function : \n\n`this.autocompleteRef?.options.find((data: MatOption) => data.selected)?.deselect();`\n\nNow, on clearing the field, the field gets cleared properly and the 'selected-related' classes are removed from that option in the dropdown but a flickering thing happening. \n\n### How can we avoid it ??? \n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click on the field to open the drodown panel.\n2. Select the first option from the dropdown. (cause this only happens with the first option)\n3. Again try to click on the field so that dropdown opens with only that option in the dropdown.\n4. While the dropdown panel is in opened state, click on the clear icon. It flickers the dropdown.\n\nBelow is the example:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e42ae5-14ff-40e3-8be9-bec6fcb78157\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOn clear icon click, it should re-open the dropdown with all the options without any flickering\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn clear icon click, there is a flicker in the dropdown section and the autocomplete dropdown panel ultimately gets closed.\n\n### Environment\n\n- \"@angular/forms\": \"16.2.12\",\n- \"@angular/material\": \"16.2.14\",\n- \"@angular/cdk\": \"16.2.14\",\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30721","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-autocomplete): Removing the selected option manually adds a flicker in the dropdown rendering.\" (#30721)"},{"Id":"2949520096","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T12:57:19","Actor":"angelaki","Number":"30720","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-table): Table not refreshing on nested detail-row column change","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI'm not sure if this scenario is supported by the API at all but imho it should be a valid scenario.\n\nIf I have an array of detail rows changing their columns does not automatically redraw the table.

Clicking **Toggle Secondary** changes the json-output but not the table\n2. Only on clicking **Toggle Primary** the table gets redrawn, respecting the current definition for the detail rows\n\nWorking StackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/av2ud5lm-ardwk8i8\nJust to make sure this also happens if all the rows are in a single array (https://stackblitz.com/edit/av2ud5lm-yhdxrfqp)\n\nNot this being a Q/A but just out of curiosity, why do I need `multiTemplateDataRows` at all? Why won't all (matching) rows get displayed by default? Asking since I tend to always use / set it but guess there might be some kind of disadvantage since this is not the default behavior?\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEven generic detail rows (created by `@for`) should behave correct.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nRight now, I need to know all my detail rows in advance. Since I'm implementing a pretty customizable table, I want to let the user create / define the rows in runtime.\n\nIf you're not going to support this case officially, a neat workaround to trigger redrawing the table would be welcome.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.1.9\nNode: 22.11.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.6.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.8\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n... service-worker\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1901.9 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.1.9\n@angular-devkit/core              19.1.9 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.1.9 (cli-only)\n@angular/cdk                      19.1.5\n@angular/cli                      19.1.9\n@angular/material                 19.1.5\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.1.5\n@schematics/angular               19.1.9 (cli-only)\nrxjs                              7.8.2\ntypescript                        5.7.3\nzone.js                           0.15.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30720","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-table): Table not refreshing on nested detail-row column change\" (#30720)"},{"Id":"2949319462","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:58:41","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30719","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30719","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#30719)"},{"Id":"2949296109","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:48:46","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30718","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.7 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30718","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.7 release\" (#30718)"},{"Id":"2949291202","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:45:35","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30717","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.7\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30717","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.7\" with changelog.\" (#30717)"},{"Id":"2949117647","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:36:22","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30715","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cherry pick fixes","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the following fixes to 19.2.x:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/pull/30634\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/pull/30631","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30715","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Cherry pick fixes\" (#30715)"},{"Id":"2949220665","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:30:55","Actor":"mistrykaran91","Number":"30716","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): update text field styles for better alignment and overflow handling","State":"closed","Body":"Currently, `mat-label` overlaps `mat-suffix` in cases for `outline` and `fill` appearance.

Previously, the hover event triggered the handler immediately, which could result in unwanted handlers showing up when the user quickly moved their cursor over column headers. This change ensures that the handlers only appear if the user pauses (hovers for 300ms) over the column header, preventing handlers from rendering during fast cursor movements.\r\n\r\n### Why this change is suggested:\r\nThe previous implementation immediately triggered the column resize handlers as soon as the user hovered over the column header, which could be distracting or lead to unnecessary renders when the user quickly moves the cursor across the page. By adding a `debounceTime(300)`, we ensure that the hover event only triggers the handler after the user has paused over the column header for at least 300ms, reducing the number of handler renders and making the interaction feel smoother.\r\n\r\nThis change prevents the handlers from appearing if the user is simply passing by the headers or trying to reach another element, improving the overall experience, especially when navigating fast through the UI.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- Added `debounceTime(300)` to the `headerCellHoveredDistinct` observable to delay the rendering of handlers until the user has hovered over the header for 300ms.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30709","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(cdk-experimental/column-resize): add debounce to column header h‚Ä¶\" (#30709)"},{"Id":"2946803866","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-25T14:48:44","Actor":"danielolaru91","Number":"30708","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(cdk-experimental/column-resize): improve hover responsiveness of‚Ä¶","State":"open","Body":"‚Ä¶ column resize with requestAnimationFrame\r\n\r\nThis PR suggests a performance improvement for the `_updateOverlayHandleHeight()` method in the `cdk-experimental` column resize feature.

If we moved to transloco, we would then implement a `withTransloco` function to work the same way.\r\n\r\nIf things like this could be added to the framework, I think it'd be a great addition and it could provide a sort of _guideline_ for third-party libs maker (just like there is a guideline from RxJS to create your custom operators)\r\n\r\n> I've never used the i18n package made by angular so, as we currently made it, it may be incomplete or not adapted yet but, with the help of the community we could finally have an easy way to set up translations in our apps\r\n\r\n> If this feature request harvests all the features specs needed for such a providefn and withXxx functions, it could be my very first contribution on angular :smile: (plus I could also open PRs on third-party libs like ngx-translate to make the withXxx functions)\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nLike I said above, a `provideTranslation` function with, for example a `locale` and `localeData` arguments.\r\n\r\nIn addition add a `...transaltionFeatures: TranslationFeature[]` to let third-party libraries maker create their `withXxx` functions to configure their lib (like `withNgxTranslate` for example)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nInstead of the first two arguments we could pass an object of options in wich we could either :\r\n- add the locale / localeData\r\n- or an autoDetect `boolean` option\r\n- or even a factory to provide locales based on a specific logic\r\n- or anything else I could not think of","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51264","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add a `provideTranslation` function to the framework (plus add a guideline to create `withXxx` features from third-party libs like ngx-translate\" (#51264)"},{"Id":"1833966252","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-03T18:35:00","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"51258","RawContent":null,"Title":"Refactor attribute extraction in the template pipeline","State":"closed","Body":"Refactor attribute extraction into separate phases with more clearly defined responsibilities.\r\n- **phaseAttributeExtraction:** Creates ops representing extracted attributes\r\n- **phaseParseExtractedStyles:** Parses extracted style and class attributes into individual extracted styles and classes\r\n- **phaseConstCollection:** Collates the extracted attributes and populates the const array\r\n\r\nThis also removes the need to store an `ElementAttributes` object on each `ElementOp` and then later replace it with a `ConstIndex`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51258","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Refactor attribute extraction in the template pipeline\" (#51258)"},{"Id":"1835008178","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-03T12:53:46","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"51262","RawContent":null,"Title":"Deferred followup refactors","State":"open","Body":"A couple of refactors around `defer` that we had discussed before plus one bug fix I found along the way.

'16w, 48w, 96w, 128w, 384w, 640w, 750w, 828w, 1080w, 1200w, 1920w' : ''\" [loaderParams]=\"{crop, width, height}\">\r\n```\r\nWe want to apply srcset only when ```crop``` is not ```true``` otherwise we want the default behavior of NgOptimizedImage like no ngSrcset was stated, from docs: \r\n```\r\nA srcset can be generated automatically from the image's width and height attributes with no further input required.\r\n\r\nExample srcset generated: <[img](https://angular.io/api/common/NgOptimizedImage) ... srcset=\"image-400w.jpg 1x, image-800w.jpg 2x\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this fails with an following error:\r\n```\r\nERROR Error: NG02952: The NgOptimizedImage directive (activated on an <img> element with the `ngSrc=\"...\"`) has detected that `ngSrcset` has an invalid value (``). To fix this, change the value to a non-empty string.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Combination of other properties\r\nThe problem is not exclusive to ngSrcset property of NgOptimizedImage as for example following is not possible neither due combination of properties ```priority``` and ```loading``` even when priority is falsey:\r\nThis throws error even when should be theoretically possible:\r\n```\r\n<img [priority]=\"false\" [loading]=\"loading\" [ngSrc]=\"path\" [height]=\"height\" [width]=\"width\">\r\n```\r\nIn the end to combine dynamic resolution of ```priority``` and ```loading``` and ```ngSrcSet``` you have to write complex multiconditionals (when you consider these two usecases then you need 4 img elements).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n- Allow ```ngSrcset``` to take some or at least one \"falsey\" value (\"\", null, undefined) that would result in default behavior as stated in the docs - that is srcset for different densities ```srcset=\"image-400w.jpg 1x, image-800w.jpg 2x\"```\r\n- Allow ```priority``` input be set together with ```loading``` and if ```priority``` is an empty string ```<img priority>``` or true ```<img [priority]=\"true\">``` ignore user-defined ```loading``` parameter. If ```<img [priority]=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\">``` then ```loading``` parameter should take effect.\r\n- Allow ```loading``` input to take falsy value and in that case fallback to default behavior (\"lazy\" when priority=false and \"eager\" when priority=true)\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nCurrently needed behavior is possible only by explicitly writing redundant ```img``` elements:\r\n```\r\n      <img *ngIf=\"crop\" [ngSrc]=\"path\" [height]=\"height\" [width]=\"width\"  [loaderParams]=\"loaderParams\">\r\n      <img *ngIf=\"!crop \" [ngSrc]=\"path\" [height]=\"height\" [width]=\"width\" [loading]=\"loading\" ngSrcset=\"16w, 48w, 96w, 128w, 384w, 640w, 750w, 828w, 1080w, 1200w, 1920w\"  [loaderParams]=\"loaderParams\">\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51261","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow to fallback to default ngSrcset in NgOptimizedImage when binded to falsy value (and combine other props) \" (#51261)"},{"Id":"1834853519","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-03T11:46:55","Actor":"mistrykaran91","Number":"51260","RawContent":null,"Title":"VSCode intellisense and import takes almost 60 seconds to show up, Even if variable is in the same file.

Effectively, we need to serialize 2 pieces of info: (1) hydration info for the root component itself and (2) hydration info for the ViewContainerRef instance (an LContainer). Each piece of information is included into the hydration data (in the TransferState object) separately, thus we end up with 2 ids. Since we only have 1 root element, we encode both bits of info into a single string: ids are separated by the `|` char (e.g. `10|25`, where `10` is the `ngh` for a component view and 25 is the `ngh` for a root view which holds LContainer).\r\n\r\nPreviously, we were only including component-related information, thus all the views in the view container remained dehydrated and duplicated (client-rendered from scratch) on the client.\r\n\r\nResolves #51157.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51247","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): handle hydration of view containers for root components\" (#51247)"},{"Id":"1832146364","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-01T23:03:18","Actor":"jsaguet","Number":"51246","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(service-worker): remove backward compatibility code","State":"open","Body":"Remove backward compatibility code from service worker package.\r\n\r\nThe changes related to navigationUrls were introduced in d49d1e7d738369abbb6b923f6ab0b1f845596763.\r\nThe changes related to old SW cache were introduced in 2326b9c2940ed99748d25ab047350ca1f5fd7e45 and later updated in e721c08c\r\n\r\nFixes #43403\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #43403\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51246","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(service-worker): remove backward compatibility code\" (#51246)"},{"Id":"1831939781","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-01T20:08:09","Actor":"ddamiankowalski","Number":"51244","RawContent":null,"Title":"Async pipe used inside an HTML template does not get the latest values","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I am trying to subscribe to an Observable  using an async pipe, the template does not seems to be subscribing correctly.

When I type in a date that is after the max date, and then open the calendar, a marker appears on both the date I typed in and the max date. This behaviour could arguably be slightly confusing to the user but it is particularly misleading in the instance that the highlighted max date is actually disabled due to custom validation. The same issue can be seen for the minimum date.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/71448881/a2f4c43d-61f4-4ee1-be13-9cd381d7e33f)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/run?file=package.json (an example from the docs)\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In datepicker-min-max-example.ts, adjust the max date so that it is not the last day of the month (so that the issue can be seen) e.g. change it to the 15th\r\n2. In the input, type in a date which is after the max date - e.g. the 18th\r\n3. Open the calendar and you will see that two dates are highlighted - the date that was typed in and the maximum date.\r\n4. Provide a custom validator that would render the maximum date disabled e.g. if the max date was a Sunday but weekends are not allowed. Repeat steps 2 & 3 and you will see that this date is highlighted even though it is invalid.\r\n5. Same steps for minimum date.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI am expecting to see only one date highlighted on the calendar - just the (invalid one) that was typed in. If this is not desired, then it should still take into account other invalid/disabled dates through customer validator, so it should highlight the maximum valid date rather than the general maximum date regardless of its validity. Likewise for the minimum date.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI saw two dates highlighted on the calendar - the date I typed in and the maximum date. The maximum date is also highlighted even when it has been rendered invalid by a custom validator, which could be misleading to users - this is the main issue. Likewise for the minimum date.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.1.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.1.6\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27573","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): Duplicate marker on calendar pop up when inputting date that is outwith min/max dates\" (#27573)"},{"Id":"1834420332","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-03T11:40:33","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27572","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): don't assign to model value while typing when requireSelection is enabled","State":"closed","Body":"Follow-up to #27423 based on the feedback.

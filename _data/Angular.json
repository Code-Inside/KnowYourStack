Thankfully, we have angular elements that allow us to create pure web-components, but unfortunately this have been misused to allow the micro frontend concept in an angular application. To allow smaller releasable packages, engineers started to create angular elements release them to a CDN site, and re-use them. This created a lot of fraction and challenges to integrate the different pieces. Not only that, but it's also awkward, as you are creating vanilla javascript code from angular code to re-use it back again from an angular code. Other solutions was iframing, which also does not scale. Or releasing smaller libs to npm and re-using them in the code, which is not desired in the case of end to end integration and mon-repo large applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nToday, we are blessed by having the lazy loading approach which help us to generate separate chunks of the code and lazy load them as the user is visiting the relevant code. While this is great, there is no way to build those chunks separately and/or publish them to a standalone CDN/Server to be used later. I think to help teams avoid mistakes like listed above, it would be awesome if we can have angular CLI able to build these chunks separately, generate an artifact for it, which can be released individually. When this is accomplished, we can then have something like this:\r\n```\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'items',\r\n    loadChildren: () => import(env.prod? 'https://CDN-XYA/chunk1.js' : './items/items.module' ).then(m => m.ItemsModule)\r\n  }\r\n]; \r\n```\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nYes, above but it's not ideal. I think angular team need to get into the micro frontend business. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40830","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Micro-Frontend: Allow to have separate build/ releasable elements for lazy loaded modules \" (#40830)"},{"Id":"806861725","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-13T01:00:21","Actor":"bjarkler","Number":"40815","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): address Trusted Types bug in Chrome 83","State":"closed","Body":"In Chrome 83 passing a TrustedScript to eval just returns the\r\nTrustedScript back without evaluating it, causing the\r\nnewTrustedFunctionFor{Dev,JIT} functions to fail.

However, it would be nice if this worked as expected without needing a work-around.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the code: while the code example below is simple and has no real point besides showing the bug, we need to set observables based on the incoming value.

This feature was very instrumental in creating custom BI tools. One other feature that could significantly add the value is resizing the widgets. If this is added angular itself will provide an ecosystem to develop BI tools. I request Angular team to consider this request and introduce it in the upcoming builds. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI believe we can keep a track on mouse click and mouse move events and alter the height and width of the element according to the mouse position. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nAt the moment, simplest alternative is to proceed with the JQuery tried and tested resizable plugins. But as Angular and JQuery not not a good mix for various. Keeping future in perspective, It would be better if this feature is comes built in the Material library itself. \r\n\r\nPlease, feel free to contact me for more info. Keep up the good work team. You guys are doing gods work 😄!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21883","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular material resizable widgets \" (#21883)"},{"Id":"806818525","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-11T23:11:21","Actor":"dev054","Number":"21881","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelectionList): Non multiple selection-list returns Array ","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: \r\n- Components: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-8izayv\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

This could also be made possible by exposing the current `private _keyManager` property either by making it protected or providing a public getter/method so that the consumer of the CdkStepper can manage that on their own.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nIn our case we want to be able to switch between vertical and horizontal orientation on a single component via an Input. Switching orientation should have some effects, most importantly that keyboard controls should be different (UP and DOWN arrows for vertical orientation).\r\nIn the current implementation and how it is implemented in material that is done by two separate components that explicitly set the `_orientation` property and setting the keymanager up in the `ngAfterViewInit` hook.\r\n\r\nPseudo Code what we'd like to do:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class MyStepper extends CdkStepper {\r\n  @Input()\r\n  set direction(value) {\r\n    this._direction = value;\r\n    this._keyManager.withVerticalOrientation(this._direction === 'vertical');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now I think just changing the orientation in the keyManager should be enough, even nicer would be that the CdkStepper would already support setting the `_orientation` property dynamically, but I'd understand if you don't want to support that inside the CdkStepper. In this case exposing the keyManager would give us as the consumer the possibility at our own risk to implement this feature and not being forced into doing two separate components.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

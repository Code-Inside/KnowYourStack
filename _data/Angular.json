However parse errors are likely to be just as (if not more) frequent than type errors, so we should return those as well.\r\n\r\nWhen `getSemanticDiagnostics` is called, we retrieve a compiler for the program that file is in. The file is checked for changed contents; if contents have been changed and it's an external template, we update known components using the template to have the new template:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/language-service/ivy/compiler_factory.ts#L56-L71\r\n\r\n`ttc.overrideComponentTemplate` parses the template and returns errors, so our work is nearly done. The only thing left to do is marshall the each of the compiler's `ParseError` into a `ts.Diagnostic`. The compiler also provides a method for creating `ts.Diagnostic`s for a template:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/typecheck/diagnostics/src/diagnostic.ts#L33-L39\r\n\r\nA usage of which for `ParseError`s is already present for the collection of components during the regular compilation pipeline:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/annotations/src/component.ts#L265-L283\r\n\r\nMost of the \"hard\" work is already done, the only missing piece is the `mapping: TemplateSourceMapping` parameter expected by `makeTemplateDiagnostic`. Actually we have this information too, we just need `TemplateTypeChecker#overrideComponentTemplate` to return it to us:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/typecheck/src/checker.ts#L105-L134\r\n\r\n`fileRecord.sourceManager` has information about the `TemplateSourceMapping` for the particular template, so we can get it from there. In particular note that `overrideComponentTemplate`, when called by the language service (AFAIK also the only user) should **only** call this for external templates (we may need to make this contract more strict/explicit), so there shouldn't need to be any extra work to be done here.\r\n\r\nThis is a \"good first issue\"; I have tagged it as such, if no one wants to claim it I will take a stab when I have some free time.\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n\r\n- There may be a question of who should report these errors. `TemplateTypeChecker` also exposes `getDiagnosticsForFile`, should that be extended to include parse errors? Maybe, because then the TTC can cache this stuff and be the \"source of truth\" for a template, but I argue no, because it should be concerned with TypeChecker and That's It :tm:\r\n- The language service's `getOrCreateWithChangedFile` now does more than just create a compiler; it also returns parse errors. Here is where I think it may make sense to make the contract between what language service queries should be used to identify changes in the workspace, and which can called without changed, more strict. In particular, I suggest one of the following:\r\n  - Expose a `didChange` API that notifies the LS of workspace changes and returns semantic diagnostics. This fits more cleanly into how the LSP actually works (`getSemanticDiagnostics` is not exposed by the LSP, a server publishes a message containing diagnostics to the client). The problem with this is `ts.LanguageService` does not have such a method, making this idea incompatible _if_ we need to keep the Angular LS as a tsserver plugin (but even in that case it might work if we just assume getSemanticDiagnostic calls on tsserver == changed workspace)\r\n  - Make a strict contract that when a workspace is changed, `getSemanticDiagnostics` is __always__ called and answered before any other LS API is called.\r\n  - Propagate parse errors to the type checking phase (a sort-of \"advanced\" case that requires a lot of additional work, could get confusing quickly, and is probably not worth it for now)\r\n\r\nKind-of related to #38061","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39434","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ivy LS: Emit diagnostics for parse errors\" (#39434)"},{"Id":"729431369","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-26T17:53:15","Actor":"imkikus","Number":"39425","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo in component overview","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #[PR](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39424)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

A new version v2 of the app was published. The built-in service worker is not behaving as expected: _sometimes_, the old version v1 of the app is displayed even when v2 has been loaded previously by the same browser. The following steps illustrate the odd behaviour (although it occurs rather randomly):\r\n\r\n- open the app: old version v1 is shown. This is still OK, as it is served up by the SW from its cache (although I would expect that if the user is online and v2 is available, v2 is displayed).\r\n- reload the page: new version v2 is displayed => OK\r\n- close the tab\r\n- open a new tab and browse to the app. Old version v1 is displayed again. Why? At this point, the service worker should have updated its cache and display v2, right?\r\n\r\nIt seems the service worker does not update its cache, even when a page reload is done. We see this behaviour occurring very randomly. Often the new version is displayed, and sometimes the old version suddenly pops up.\r\n\r\nWe observed this behaviour in Chrome and Samsung Internet.\r\n\r\n## Desired behaviour\r\nOnce the new version v2 is loaded by the browser, the old version v1 should never be displayed again.\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.4\r\nNode: 12.18.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core               10.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         10.0.4\r\n@angular/cdk                       10.1.0\r\n@angular/cli                       10.0.4\r\n@angular/material                  10.1.0\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   10.1.0\r\n@angular/service-worker         10.0.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   10.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular                10.0.4\r\n@schematics/update                 0.1000.4\r\nrxjs                               6.6.0\r\ntypescript                         3.9.7\r\nwebpack                            4.43.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Service Worker does not update cached files even when new version is fetched\" (#39426)"},{"Id":"729202069","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-26T03:18:03","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"39423","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): update a typo in the comment of ngZoneEventCoalescing","State":"open","Body":"Fix a typo in the comment of `ngZoneEventCoalescing`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39423","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(core): update a typo in the comment of ngZoneEventCoalescing\" (#39423)"},{"Id":"729198813","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-26T03:08:02","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"39422","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): add shouldCoalesceChangeDetection option to coalesce change detections","State":"open","Body":"Close #39348\r\n\r\nNow `NgZone` has an option `shouldCoalesceEventChangeDetection` to coalesce\r\nmultiple event handler's change detections to one async change detection.\r\n\r\nAnd there are some cases other than `event handler` have the same issues.\r\nIn #39348, the case like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// This code results in one change detection occurring per\r\n// ngZone.run() call.

This does however require the\r\nbundler/optimizer to have been configured in a certain way, as to allow\r\nfor `ngDevMode` guarded code to be removed.\r\n\r\nAs an example, Terser can be configured to remove the `ngDevMode`\r\nguarded code using the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst terserOptions = {\r\n  // ...\r\n  compress: {\r\n    // ...\r\n    global_defs: require('@angular/compiler-cli').GLOBAL_DEFS_FOR_TERSER,\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31595#issuecomment-519129090)\r\n\r\nIf this is not done, however, the bundle should still work (albeit with\r\nlarger code size due to missed tree-shaking opportunities).

-->\r\nNo. As far as I can tell this would have been an issue for as long as Angular CLI has been using `process.title = 'something';`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNode's `process.title` overwrites the entire window title in Windows Command Prompt, which is non-standard behaviour, and makes it very difficult to identify similar windows.\r\n\r\nStandard Windows Command Prompt behaviour is to show \"{title} - {command}\", and this works perfectly if I comment out or remove any reference to `process.title`, for instance in `packages/angular/cli/bin/ng`:\r\n```\r\n// Provide a title to the process in `ps`.\r\n// Due to an obscure Mac bug, do not start this title with any symbol.\r\ntry {\r\n  process.title = 'ng ' + Array.from(process.argv).slice(2).join(' ');\r\n} catch (_) {\r\n  // If an error happened above, use the most basic title.\r\n  process.title = 'ng';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n1. Open a Windows Command Prompt using `cmd.exe`.\r\n2. Set the title of the window using the `title` command (e.g. `title My Angular App`).\r\n3. Run any `ng` command (`ng version`, `ng build --watch`, etc...)\r\n4. While `ng` is running, the title of the window is completely replaced by whatever `ng` command was run.\r\n\r\nTechnically, step 2 is not required to exhibit this bug. I mention it merely to demonstrate why I'm using it (as mentioned in the \"Anything else\" section below).

[**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user’s experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel’s visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 → 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 → 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user’s privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map’s `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin’s bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.35`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7035)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.34...7.0.35)\n\n-   Add migration guide link to PostCSS 8 error text.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Maybe in the next lines also, but I did not check it yet.\r\n\r\nI tried to add an element, that perfectly fits, but I could not. I realized that the double of the original margin is used on the right side. I used LTR.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n\r\nTake a document, that has 400px width. The margin is 20px on the viewport of the overlay. I tried to add one overlay at (300, 20) with size of (80,40). I will use this in the stackblitz and in the calculations.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ardamx\r\n\r\n![overlay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6360699/97225389-df307d00-17d2-11eb-8399-e5a339d20aca.gif)\r\n\r\nAs you see the overlay is positioned well at the begining. 100px is the container. 80px is the overlay. 10-80-10 is well positioned.\r\n\r\nIf the body element is 420px width, the position is right. 0-80-20.\r\n\r\nIf the body is shrinked more to 400px, the position will not be 0-80-20, however it could fit.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\npushX to be 0 in this case. The element should fit without pushing it. The margin should be 20px on the right, too.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nstart.x is 300, the width is 80 as these are given. The viewport width is 360px (=400px-2*20px).\r\n\r\npushX will be -20 as overflowRight is 20. This is calculated by 300+80-360=20.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong. The element can fit without pushing it. The margin is now the double of the originally given, which is 40px in this case.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.1.3\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.5\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome (Could be any)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS (Could be any)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20890","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(overlay): Push calculation is wrong with FlexibleConnectedPositionStrategy\" (#20890)"},{"Id":"729864008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-26T20:00:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"20889","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/dialog): incorrect action height if box-sizing is configured globally","State":"open","Body":"It's common for apps to set `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` at a global level which ends up breaking the styles of our dialog.

The current APIs are a bit too complex; this can have a negative impact on `TestHarness` adoption.\r\n\r\n# For test authors\r\n\r\n## 1. Easier access to harness\r\n\r\n`HarnessLoader` is a nice abstraction but it can make harness instantiation cumbersome.\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\nlet loader: HarnessLoader;\r\nlet rootLoader: HarnessLoader;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n  loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);\r\n  rootLoader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.documentRootLoader(fixture);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.harnessForFixture(fixture, MyDialogButtonHarness);\r\n\r\n  const buttonHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonHarness);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have faster harness access like:\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 1.A\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.getHarness(MyDialogButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n\r\n  const buttonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.getHarness(MyButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even global functions like `getHarness` and `getProtractorHarness` functions could make the tests even more readable:\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 1.B\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await getHarness(MyDialogButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n  const buttonHarness = await getHarness(MyButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# For harness authors\r\n\r\n## 2. `LocatorFactory` abstraction\r\n\r\nThe `LocatorFactory` approach _(e.g. `locatorFor()` method returns a function that takes no parameters)_ can be confusing and cumbersome.\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';\r\n\r\n  protected getTriggerElement = this.locatorFor('button');\r\n\r\n  async toggle() {\r\n    const trigger = await this.getTriggerElement();\r\n    return trigger.click();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 2.A\r\n\r\nSimple accessor methods like `get()` or `getOptional()` seem easier to use and more intuitive.\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';\r\n\r\n  async toggle() {\r\n    const trigger = await this.get('button');\r\n    return trigger.click();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can let developers factorize the way they want:\r\n```ts\r\ngetTriggerElement() {\r\n  return this.get('button');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. `async / await` vs chaining\r\n\r\nI am personally not a big fan of chaining (a.k.a. builder pattern) but in cases like this one where we end up with lots of `await`s, this can simplify the interface:\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nasync isDisabled() {\r\n  const el = await this.getMessageElement();\r\n  const text = await el.text();\r\n  return text === 'Disabled';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 3.A\r\n```ts\r\nasync isDisabled() {\r\n  return (await this.getMessageElement().text()) === 'Disabled';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Trigger any event\r\n\r\n`TestElement` should have a `triggerEvent` function that allows harness authors to trigger any event. \r\n\r\n### Suggestion 4.A\r\n```ts\r\nel.triggerEvent('dragenter', {})\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Common\r\n\r\n## 5. Provide synchronous functions\r\n\r\nSome environments can query the DOM synchronously (e.g. `TestbedHarnessEnvironment`) or through some under the hood chaining (e.g. Cypress) (Cf. https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress.html#Chains-of-Commands).\r\nHarness authors might want to focus on these environments. In that case, they will want to use synchronous functions and keep tests and harnesses easier to read & write.\r\n\r\n### Current approach\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass ItemListHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'app-item-list';\r\n\r\n  getItems = this.locatorForAll('li');\r\n\r\n  async getItemNames() {\r\n    const items = await this.getItems();\r\n    const itemNames = await Promise.all(items.map(item => item.text()));\r\n    return itemNames;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const itemListHarness = await loader.getHarness(ItemListHarness);\r\n  expect(await itemListHarness.getItemNames()).toEqual(['🍔', '🍟']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 5.A\r\n\r\nProviding synchronous alternatives to accessors.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass ItemListHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'app-item-list';\r\n\r\n  getItemNamesSync() {\r\n    return this.getAllSync('li').map(item => item.textSync());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', () => {\r\n  const itemListHarness = loader.getHarnessSync(ItemListHarness);\r\n  expect(itemListHarness.getItemNamesSync()).toEqual(['🍔', '🍟']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 6. `TestbedHarnessEnvironment ` vs. `TestBedHarnessEnvironment `\r\n\r\n`TestbedHarnessEnvironment` could be renamed to `TestBedHarnessEnvironment` to stay consistent with `TestBed` 😉\r\n\r\n## 7. Merge `TestBed` and `TestbedHarnessEnvironment`\r\n\r\nIn some future, wouldn't it be nice to merge `TestbedHarnessEnvironment` with `TestBed` which means moving test harness to the angular repo?\r\n\r\n## 8. Cypress support\r\n\r\nAn external library could provide a `CypressHarnessEnvironment` but as presented in the 5th item, Cypress is based on an abstract chain of commands. `TestElement` doesn't seem to be the right abstraction for this use case especially for getters like `text()`, `getProperty()` etc...\r\n\r\nThis is the last item on the list but probably the most important one. One of the key features of harnesses is the test environment abstraction and harness reuse through environments (TestBed, Protractor etc...) but if I am using TestBed and Cypress and if I can't reuse my harnesses with Cypress then it somewhat defeats the purpose of harnesses. \r\n\r\n ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(@angular/cdk/testing): Component Harness Feedback\" (#20871)"},{"Id":"728306226","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-23T15:19:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"20870","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): some screen readers announcing long decimal values","State":"open","Body":"Note: this is a resubmit of #20721 which renames the `aria-valuetext` input to `valueText` based on the note in #20849.\r\n\r\nIt looks like some screen readers announce the value of a slider by calculating the percentage themselves using the `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax` and `aria-valuenow`. The problem is that they don't round down the decimals so for a slider between 0 and 1\r\nwith a step of 0.1, they end up reading out values like 0.20000068.

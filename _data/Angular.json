It warns developers when a numeric value is bound to a CSS property that requires a unit (e.g., `[style.width]=\"500\"`), which would have no effect in the browser. The diagnostic suggests using a unit suffix (e.g., `[style.width.px]=\"500\"` or `[style.width]=\"'500px'\"`).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nBinding numeric values to CSS properties without units is a common source of confusion and bugs. Browsers ignore such values, leading to unexpected UI behavior. This diagnostic helps developers catch these mistakes early and provides actionable suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Triggers warning -->\r\n<div [style.width]=\"500\"></div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Correct usage -->\r\n<div [style.width.px]=\"500\"></div>\r\n<div [style.width]=\"'500px'\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n Diagnostic Message\r\n> Binding a number to the CSS property 'width' will have no effect. CSS requires units for length values.

If the HTTP request occurred during server side rendering, this results in the app _crashing_ altogether.\n\nThis was unexpected and we only diagnosed why our app was crashing in certain environments after doing some very deep server-side debugging into the source of the error. This difference isn't documented anywhere that I can find.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt would be helpful if there was some mechanism to ensure that errors that occur during HTTP requests when the HttpClient is configured with `withFetch` are still able to fall back to the global error handler. I'm not sure what that would look like -- maybe configuration that can be passed into the `withFetch()` call?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEverywhere we make an HTTP request _should_ already have explicit error handling, but there are a lot of places that don't have it in our codebase. These are mostly not on purpose (just oversights when implementing new features years ago), and those places have never caused any major issues because the global error handler catches the errors when HttpClient uses the XHR backend.\n\nWe already have logging set up in our global error handler to inform us when server-side network requests are failing like this so we can address them and add proper error handling, and for the sake of reliability we would prefer to catch failing network requests this way (rather than the entire application going down in production.) Our global error handler also adds some metadata to these errors that can be helpful when debugging; the app crashing altogether is a lot harder to debug because the error is more confusing and does not include that metadata.\n\nThank you!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63704","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide some mechanism for HTTP errors to fall back to global

This could lead to issues in server-side rendering environments where multiple requests are processed concurrently, as they could inadvertently share or overwrite the global injector state.\r\n\r\nThe new approach introduces a `BootstrapContext` that is passed to the `bootstrapApplication` function. This context provides a platform reference that is scoped to the individual request, ensuring that each server-side render has an isolated platform injector. This prevents state leakage between concurrent requests and makes the overall process more reliable.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\nThe server-side bootstrapping process has been changed to eliminate the reliance on a global platform injector.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```ts\r\nconst bootstrap = () => bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, config);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```ts\r\nconst bootstrap = (context: BootstrapContext) =>\r\n  bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, config, context);\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular/ssr): introduce BootstrapContext for isolated server-side rendering\" (#31152)"},{"Id":"3402976247","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-10T15:43:02","Actor":"rwlogel","Number":"31158","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vite security issue CVE-2025-58751 ","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nThe current `vite` requirement for Angular 20.2 is `7.1.2` our build system identified this vulnerability CVE https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58751 that is corrected in `7.1.5`.\n\nIs there any reason that `~7.1.5` can't be specified so that this and future minor patches can be used? \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31158","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vite security issue CVE-2025-58751 \" (#31158)"},{"Id":"3401693319","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-10T12:21:11","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31157","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): align labels in ai-config schema","State":"closed","Body":"The labels in the `ai-config` schematic were not aligned, this commit fixes the alignment.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31157","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): align labels in ai-config schema\" (#31157)"},{"Id":"3399181558","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-10T08:42:13","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31151","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/cli): promote MCP find_examples tool to a stable tool","State":"closed","Body":"The `find_examples` MCP tool has undergone significant enhancements, including the implementation of a structured relational database, advanced filtering, weighted search ranking, and snippet support.\r\n\r\nGiven its maturity, robustness, and utility, the tool is now considered stable and is promoted to the default set of enabled tools for the MCP server.

Description\n\nHello,\n\nI am opening this issue because when using `redirectTo` in the `children` of a route, when SSG is enabled, Angular generates a blank page for `index.html`:\n\n```ts\n// app.routes.ts\nexport const routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    component: LayoutComponent,\n    children: [\n      {\n        path: '',\n        pathMatch: 'full',\n        redirectTo:

http-equiv=\"refresh\">` soft redirect as explained in the [documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/ssr#redirects).\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue easily:\n\n```\ngit clone

One component is using the Monaco Editor (ngx-monaco-editor-v2) and the other is using rete and rete-angular-plugin/20 .  The example I'm providing below is using Monaco\n\nThe component with monaco editor works as expected when opened as a normal route in the app.  But, when opening as either a ComponentPortal or TemplatePortal (I tried both ways) the editor acts strangely - the cursor doesn't show, and key commands don't act as expected (ex. backspace will sometimes duplicate a line, space will sometimes create a new line, and I can't place the cursor where I want it) \n\nWith the rete library, same thing - on a normal route, it acts as expected, but in the portal, the mouse drag for the nodes doesn't work, or is heavily delayed, and then will not release from the mouse and will continue to move around.  The  node connections can't be dropped or added, etc.  Function calls still work, however. \n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHere's a sandbox of the issue\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/portal-f5x3ly\n1.

Since I can't show my code, I will be using the example given in the docs to show a few of the weird behaviors I noticed. You can follow along with the [Date range picker forms integration example](https://material.angular.dev/components/datepicker/examples#date-range-picker-forms) in the docs.\n\nI'm sorry for not using the intended way of creating the bug request but I saw no way to report basically identical bugs in one ticket in another way.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n**Link**: see description\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\n#### Bug 1: Start/end stays invalid, then fixed by proxy\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. 9/9/2020 - 9/9/2020)\n2. Set invalid end (e.g. 31/31/2020)\n3. Make end valid by changing start\n=> Expected: end is valid. Actual: end is still marked as invalid. This is because of the default Angular Forms behavior but I wish it would be overridden by DatePicker for these cases for better UX.\n\n#### Bug 2: Any date invalid by itself won't show error message but turn field red\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change day of start/end to e.g. 90 to make it invalid.\n=> Expected: start/end field is marked red and an error message is displayed below. Actual: field is marked red but no error message appears.\n\n#### Bug 3: The only way to make both errors show at the same time is ... weird\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change end date to be earlier than start date\n  - **Expected**: end date marked red (because end < start?) but no error shown as both dates are still valid on their own and no specific mat-error is listed for this case in HTML.\n  - **Actual**: shows end date message (even though both are technically valid by themselves?)\n3. Edit start date to invalid date, then directly back to valid date\n  => Expected: same as above. Actual: shows start and end date message, even though start is now valid again and end date was never invalid by itself? Also, the start message should've appeared when it got invalid, not just now.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Tested with V17 - V20.2.2.

But I am not sure where to file that, and this seems like this should be on the radar for the Material docs users using Firefox.\n\nI was trying to run Material doc examples in Firefox. After messing around, I was able to fix it by commenting out some of the root SCSS. In particular, something about the `@use '@angular/material' as mat` will cause Firefox ran Stackblitz projects to hang on the `\"ng serve --> Building...\"` phase in the terminal and `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\nBelow is what has to be done to any Material styled file to get them to work, nullifying theming.\n\n```scss\n// @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\nbody {\n  font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 30px;\n  height: 100%;\n\n  // @include mat.theme((\n  //   color: (\n  //     theme-type: light,\n  //     primary: mat.$azure-palette,\n  //     tertiary: mat.$blue-palette,\n  //   ),\n  //   typography: Roboto,\n  //   density: 0,\n  // ));\n}\n\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nSame applies to other theming file locations, like in-component styles which are just \n\n```ts\n  styles: `\n    @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n  `,\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \n\n- Broken: 20.1 with styling (won't ever finish building and actually load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\n- Works: 20.1 without styling (will load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi-uz1gcmh1?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\nAdditionally, here are links from the v18 and v19 docs that can pop open a pre-existing Stackblitz with the same issue\n\n- 18: https://v18.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n- 19: https://v19.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open Firefox\n2. Open both links\n3. Observe that \"20.1 without styling\" loads\n4. Observe that \"20.1 with styling\" hangs\n5. Note the difference between both's root `styles.scss`\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nApp serves and loads\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nApp hangs on \"ng serve --> Building...\" in the terminal and the `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\n### Environment\n\nThis applies to any previous version using the new theming API, so v18 and v19 as well as v20.

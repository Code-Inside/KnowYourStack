They each had\r\ntheir own implementation so they needed to store the values on the\r\n`Route` so they both had access to them. I imagine this was the case\r\nbecause trying to inject `Router` (to get access to the events) into the\r\npreloader would have caused a circular dependency.\r\n\r\nThis refactor co-locates the loading details with the loader itself\r\nrather than leaking implementation into the public route config and\r\nmutating the object in an awkward way.

At first glance it looks like it makes your cursor jump around, but putting breakpoints on lines `9598` (`refreshView(tView, lView, templateFn, context);`) and `9602` (`rendererFactory.end();`) of `@angular/core/fesm2015/core.mjs`, you can see that Angular is actually generating a new input, causing the list to grow and other inputs to move, and then deleting another input. This does not seem to be the case when using objects. \r\n\r\nYou might say I should add a trackBy function to track by index, but the thing is, this behaviour is solved by passing in ANY trackBy function, even a void one. Surely if a void trackBy function fixes this issue, then it should just work by default, otherwise, you should be able to just add a flag to the directive to make this example work.\r\n\r\nHere's how to reproduce:\r\n```html\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let val of array; let i = index\">\r\n  <input [(ngModel)]=\"array[i]\" />\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class OneComponent {\r\n  array = '000000'.split('');\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen try to type into the inputs.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason this works fine:\r\n```html\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let val of array; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">\r\n  <input [(ngModel)]=\"array[i]\" />\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class OneComponent {\r\n  array = '000000'.split('');\r\n  trackByFn() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a picture of the intermediate extra input while debugging - I typed 1 into index 2, it moved down to index 3, and then there were two index 5s.\r\n\r\n![ngForBug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60244464/163540388-653a4b7d-2a08-492a-8e4e-d94138934408.png)\r\n\r\nThe end result looks like this - having 1s in two inputs instead of one, the focus moves down an input as well.\r\n\r\n![ngForBug2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60244464/163540962-ff55303e-b26d-49bb-b1d5-118ebce6a7de.png)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, with an array of objects this weird intermediate input doesn't appear, so what gives?

[`v0.14.36`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01436)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.35...v0.14.36)\n\n-   Revert path metadata validation for now ([#&#8203;2177](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2177))\n\n    This release reverts the path metadata validation that was introduced in the previous release. This validation has uncovered a potential issue with how esbuild handles `onResolve` callbacks in plugins that will need to be fixed before path metadata validation is re-enabled.\n\n### [`v0.14.35`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01435)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.34...v0.14.35)\n\n-   Add support for parsing `typeof` on #private fields from TypeScript 4.7 ([#&#8203;2174](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2174))\n\n    The upcoming version of TypeScript now lets you use `#private` fields in `typeof` type expressions:\n\n    https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7-beta/#typeof-on-private-fields\n\n    ```ts\n    class Container {\n      #data = \"hello!\";\n\n      get data(): typeof this.#data {\n        return this.#data;\n      }\n\n      set data(value: typeof this.#data) {\n        this.#data = value;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, esbuild can now parse these new type expressions as well. This feature was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Add Opera and IE to internal CSS feature support matrix ([#&#8203;2170](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2170))\n\n    Version 0.14.18 of esbuild added Opera and IE as available target environments, and added them to the internal JS feature support matrix. CSS feature support was overlooked, however. This release adds knowledge of Opera and IE to esbuild's internal CSS feature support matrix:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    a {\n      color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --target=opera49 --minify) */\n    a{color:rgba(0,0,0,.5)}\n\n    /* New output (with --target=opera49 --minify) */\n    a{color:#&#8203;00000080}\n    ```\n\n    The fix for this issue was contributed by [@&#8203;sapphi-red](https://togithub.com/sapphi-red).\n\n-   Change TypeScript class field behavior when targeting ES2022\n\n    TypeScript 4.3 introduced a breaking change where class field behavior changes from assign semantics to define semantics when the `target` setting in `tsconfig.json` is set to `ESNext`. Specifically, the default value for TypeScript's `useDefineForClassFields` setting when unspecified is `true` if and only if `target` is `ESNext`. TypeScript 4.6 introduced another change where this behavior now happens for both `ESNext` and `ES2022`. Presumably this will be the case for `ES2023` and up as well. With this release, esbuild's behavior has also been changed to match. Now configuring esbuild with `--target=es2022` will also cause TypeScript files to use the new class field behavior.\n\n-   Validate that path metadata returned by plugins is consistent\n\n    The plugin API assumes that all metadata for the same path returned by a plugin's `onResolve` callback is consistent. Previously this assumption was just assumed without any enforcement. Starting with this release, esbuild will now enforce this by generating a build error if this assumption is violated. The lack of validation has not been an issue (I have never heard of this being a problem), but it still seems like a good idea to enforce it. Here's a simple example of a plugin that generates inconsistent `sideEffects` metadata:\n\n    ```js\n    let buggyPlugin = {\n      name: 'buggy',\n      setup(build) {\n        let count = 0\n        build.onResolve({ filter: /^react$/ }, args => {\n          return {\n            path: require.resolve(args.path),\n            sideEffects: count++ > 0,\n          }\n        })\n      },\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Since esbuild processes everything in parallel, the set of metadata that ends up being used for a given path is essentially random since it's whatever the task scheduler decides to schedule first. Thus if a plugin does not consistently provide the same metadata for a given path, subsequent builds may return different results. This new validation check prevents this problem.\n\n    Here's the new error message that's shown when this happens:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] [plugin buggy] Detected inconsistent metadata for the path \"node_modules/react/index.js\" when it was imported here:\n\n            button.tsx:1:30:\n              1 │ import { createElement } from 'react'\n                ╵                               ~~~~~~~\n\n          The original metadata for that path comes from when it was imported here:\n\n            app.tsx:1:23:\n              1 │ import * as React from 'react'\n                ╵                        ~~~~~~~\n\n          The difference in metadata is displayed below:\n\n           {\n          -  \"sideEffects\": true,\n          +  \"sideEffects\": false,\n           }\n\n          This is a bug in the \"buggy\" plugin. Plugins provide metadata for a given path in an \"onResolve\"\n          callback. All metadata provided for the same path must be consistent to ensure deterministic\n          builds. Due to parallelism, one set of provided metadata will be randomly chosen for a given path,\n          so providing inconsistent metadata for the same path can cause non-determinism.\n\n-   Suggest enabling a missing condition when `exports` map fails ([#&#8203;2163](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2163))\n\n    This release adds another suggestion to the error message that happens when an `exports` map lookup fails if the failure could potentially be fixed by adding a missing condition. Here's what the new error message looks like (which now suggests `--conditions=module` as a possible workaround):\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"@&#8203;sentry/electron/main\"\n\n            index.js:1:24:\n              1 │ import * as Sentry from '@&#8203;sentry/electron/main'\n                ╵                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n          The path \"./main\" is not currently exported by package \"@&#8203;sentry/electron\":\n\n            node_modules/@&#8203;sentry/electron/package.json:8:13:\n              8 │   \"exports\": {\n                ╵              ^\n\n          None of the conditions provided (\"require\", \"module\") match any of the currently active conditions\n          (\"browser\", \"default\", \"import\"):\n\n            node_modules/@&#8203;sentry/electron/package.json:16:14:\n              16 │     \"./main\": {\n                 ╵               ^\n\n          Consider enabling the \"module\" condition if this package expects it to be enabled. You can use\n          \"--conditions=module\" to do that:\n\n            node_modules/@&#8203;sentry/electron/package.json:18:6:\n              18 │       \"module\": \"./esm/main/index.js\"\n                 ╵       ~~~~~~~~\n\n          Consider using a \"require()\" call to import this file, which will work because the \"require\"\n          condition is supported by this package:\n\n            index.js:1:24:\n              1 │ import * as Sentry from '@&#8203;sentry/electron/main'\n                ╵                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n          You can mark the path \"@&#8203;sentry/electron/main\" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which\n          will remove this error.\n\n    This particular package had an issue where it was using the Webpack-specific `module` condition without providing a `default` condition. It looks like the intent in this case was to use the standard `import` condition instead. This specific change wasn't suggested here because this error message is for package consumers, not package authors.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine-npm</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/releases/v4.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/compare/v4.0.2...v4.1.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/blob/main/release_notes/4.1.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>jasmine/jasmine</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/v4.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/compare/v4.0.1...v4.1.0)\n\nPlease see the [release notes](https://togithub.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/4.1.0.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.9.0`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/v5.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.8.0...v5.9.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **web:** add a config item to web，let the developer can select whether enable the html cache ([#&#8203;3110](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3110)) ([b30ba81](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/b30ba81b86d3fa11a18bdb32a7adf162f16794e0))\n\nVerdaccio cache the initial HTML render to improve performance, this might be not a required in some cases, the new property `web.html_cache`  disable this optimization. by [@&#8203;Tiny-Fendy](https://togithub.com/Tiny-Fendy)\n\n    web:\n      html_cache: false\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **deps:** update dependency [@&#8203;verdaccio/ui-theme](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/ui-theme) to v6.0.0-6-next.23 ([#&#8203;3106](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3106)) ([b963f7d](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/b963f7db2a2273983c0d5b4792a84601be732823)) by [@&#8203;juanpicado](https://togithub.com/juanpicado)\n\n> The UI is being shared between V5 and V6 (for easy maintenance) but some features are partially enabled for V5.\n\nThe search component has been improved for V6, but for V5 is does not show all the potential but is able to display the description of the package and the **latest** published version on search private packages.

Some max_old_space_size settings automatically crashed before the upgrade, but now I can't serve or build my app at all.\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nIn V12.2.9, I could serve and build my app with 10gb or more of max_old_space_size.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, I have gone from 12.2.9 and being able to serve and build my app without issue to 13.3.2 and not being able to serve or build my app with up to 40gb of max_old_space_size.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have either gotten a mixture of scavenge and mark-sweep related messages about the JavaScript heap or when using multiples of 8gb (8192, 16384) and a couple other random memory limits, I get this error (with no other information):\r\n`<--- Last few GCs --->\r\n\r\n<--- JS stacktrace --->\r\n\r\n#\r\n# Fatal javascript OOM in GC during deserialization\r\n#`\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly small sized app (<60mb w/o node modules) with a large amount of processing power. There's almost no starting data, but it pulls in large amounts of data (manufacturing schedules in up to 5 year horizons; average of 35 designs per scenario; 13 data parameters per design) and performs analysis and utilizes Excel libraries (mostly Infragistics) for display.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI am and have been running with `node --max_old_space_size=10240 --report-on-fatalerror node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng s -o` (up to 40000). I would suggest that a small app with a lot of processing power built in 12.2.9 and then upgraded to 13.3.2 would reproduce this issue. It may require using some Infragistics components (data-grid, spreadsheet, chart), but I'm not sure since I've had IG in my build since I started it about 1.5 years ago.\r\n\r\nMy

Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI upgraded a big project to have ssr and the app loads properly in the browser, but on the server there are a lot of console errors about unmatched routes. All of them have to do with `.js.map` files it seems. Like `input.js.map`, `clipboard.js.map`, `ngrx-store-localstorage.js.map` and other .map files from the libraries used in the project. I thought at first it was an express-engine related error that it can't match requests for those lib files, but I added `server.use((err, req, res, next) => { console.error('err :)');  });` to the server and it is never called, furthermore the text in the error is very \"angular\" like.\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe project is too big and tight together to extract and reproduce with any similar results.

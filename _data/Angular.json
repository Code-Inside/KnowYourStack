For tests that use DOM, TestBed would behave the same as before and rely on more complete `DOCUMENT` instances.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56422","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): handle incomplete `DOCUMENT` instances during cleanup in tests\" (#56422)"},{"Id":"2349837108","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T23:26:51","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"56421","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56421","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.2\" with changelog.\" (#56421)"},{"Id":"2349828742","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T23:20:47","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"56420","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.3 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56420","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.3 release\" (#56420)"},{"Id":"2349825466","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T23:17:49","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"56419","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56419","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.3\" with changelog.\" (#56419)"},{"Id":"2349763085","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T22:36:28","Actor":"dreamstar-enterprises","Number":"56418","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular - optional chaining not working with Signal object with optional property, ","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncommon, core\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @if(user().contracts;

The inflight library has not received updates or support and presents a critical resource release vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n**Dependency name**: inflight\r\n**Version**: 1.0.6\r\n**Vulnerability description**: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\r\n**Technical details**:\r\n\r\n- **Affected package**: inflight\r\n\r\n- **Detailed vulnerability path**:\r\n\r\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular@18.0.3 › babel-plugin-istanbul@6.1.1 › test-exclude@6.0.0 › glob@7.2.3 › inflight@1.0.6\r\n`\r\n\r\n- **Description**: The affected versions of this package are vulnerable to missing release of resource after effective lifetime via the makeres function. Improperly deleting keys from the reqs object after executing callbacks causes the keys to remain in the reqs object, leading to resource exhaustion, which can result in node process or application crash.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- The babel-plugin-istanbul@6.1.1 library has not been updated in over 3 years, suggesting it is no longer maintained.\r\n\r\n- However, the test-exclude and glob libraries have received updates and are currently maintained, indicating that the problem mainly lies with the outdated babel-plugin-istanbul.\r\n\r\n- PoC (Proof of Concept)\r\n```js\r\nconst inflight = require('inflight');\r\n\r\nfunction testInflight() {\r\n  let i = 0;\r\n  function scheduleNext() {\r\n    let key = `key-${i++}`;\r\n    const callback = () => {\r\n    };\r\n    for (let j = 0; j < 1000000; j++) {\r\n      inflight(key, callback);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    setImmediate(scheduleNext);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (i % 100 === 0) {\r\n    console.log(process.memoryUsage());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  scheduleNext();\r\n}\r\n\r\ntestInflight();\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27842","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vulnerability in inflight dependency in the dependency chain of @angular-devkit/build-angular\" (#27842)"},{"Id":"2349669030","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-13T12:17:43","Actor":"csvn","Number":"27833","RawContent":null,"Title":"Worker and global style files do not respect `sourceMap.hidden`","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen setting `build.options.sourceMap.hidden` to `true`, there is two cases I've seen where `//# sourceMappingURL=` is still added to the bottom of the file: any scripts files added as worker, and for style files specified in `build.options.styles`. I cannot find a way to make all emitted files respect the `hidden` flag for sourcemaps.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a new Angular project:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   npx @angular/cli@latest new --style=css --ssr=false ng-repro\r\n   ```\r\n2. Add `angular.json` config to use hidden sourcemaps:\r\n   ```jsonc\r\n   \"build\": {\r\n     \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",\r\n       \"options\": {\r\n         \"sourceMap\": {\r\n           \"hidden\": true,\r\n           \"scripts\": true,\r\n           \"styles\": true\r\n         },\r\n         // ...\r\n   ```\r\n3. Add a worker file at `src/main.worker.ts`:\r\n   ```ts\r\n   globalThis.postMessage('Hello! I am a worker!');\r\n   ```\r\n4. Import the worker in `main.ts`, by adding this at the bottom:\r\n   ```ts\r\n   const worker = new Worker(new URL('./main.worker', import.meta.url));\r\n   worker.addEventListener('message', e => console.log(e.data));\r\n   ```\r\n5.

This allows us to use the `assert` API for expressive assertions and print failures with more details.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that the test runner and the test file are actually executed as two separate processes. This means that we run `node --test` for _each_ test and print out N reports each containing exactly 1 test. This isn't ideal, but it's good enough for using assertions. We can also explore using `node --test` for the test runner just to print a single test report with all the tests listed. This might require running test code in process with the test runner.\r\n\r\n`node --test` is a little awkward in that it seems to treat all arguments as file paths to test, meaning there's no easy way to pass arguments into the tests. Since we're actually invoking our own test runner, we need to pass through the actual file being tested, but this is not easy to do with `node --test`. I feel like `node --test test_runner.js -- file_under_test.js` _should_ work, but actually doesn't. Instead, I opted to pass the file through as an environment variable. It's inelegant, but good enough for now.\r\n\r\nI also had to separate out running a _test_ from running an arbitrary process, which were previously using the same code path and conflicting with each other.\r\n\r\nExample output for a test failure: https://gist.github.com/dgp1130/e795d5d540ec98de7aac02a363f56998","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27835","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test: use Node test runner for E2E tests\" (#27835)"},{"Id":"2349602044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T20:11:57","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27832","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): improve console status logging for add command","State":"open","Body":"The step-based console UI of the add command has been refactored to use the `listr2` library.

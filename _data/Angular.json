the DOM subtree of the component is detached from the DOM, but kept in-memory.\n\n**Except for the content of an iframe, in Chrome!**\nIn Chrome, the shadowDom content of the iframe disappears when you navigate away from the route, and re-appears only when you come back to the same route.\n\n- While still on the route: \n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c163732c-087f-4eab-9ea3-26b10e98f473)\n\n\n- When on a different route (aka when the entire view of this component is hidden from view, but still remains in-memory, thanks to the route-reuse):\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b59dd84f-5a61-44fd-a788-a982caa3673b)\n\n\n\n**Why is this a problem?**\nBecause we have a complex application where the iframe executes heavy logic upon initialization. This logic gets re-run when the iframe's content is mounted back to the DOM.\n\nThis defeats the purpose of the `RouteReuseStrategy`. The sole reason of using it was to keep this iframe from re-initializing every time we navigate back-and-forth.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n1. Implement and use a custom RouteReuseSTrategy. For simplicity, have it cache all routes.\n2. For one of the route components, include an iframe in the template\n3. Navigate away from the loaded component with the iframe visible\n\n**Current behaviour**\nIn Chrome, the content of the iframe mysteriously disappears when the component is detached.

It works as it should, but does not provide much in form of extensibility. You can configure it to do most things, but you do not have full control over the code. This is why we want to use workbox instead.\n\nWe can build workbox into our application from a production build, but this is cumbersome when developing the service-worker and we want to test features and functionality frequently. Then you have a code, compile, wait, test cycle which takes a lot of time. We want to be able to serve our service-worker using the built in vite dev-server in angular, like we can for @angular/pwa service-workers.\n\nSomeone suggested [using a custom esbuilder](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26857#issuecomment-1889313739) for this. I found two alternative builders which allow for esbuild plugins to be injected into the build process: `@angular-builders/custom-esbuild:application` or `@nx/angular:application`. But they seem to be executing too soon and [do not have access to all files nescessary](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77887040/building-workbox-into-angular-using-custom-esbuilder) to build up a proper manifest of all the output files from the build process.\n\nSo I disected the build and the serve flow in angular-cli, in order to see how we could extend the build process with our needs:\n\n## ng build\n\nWhen we run `ng build`, the following code is invoked:\n\n[@angular-devkit:application](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6f9a764526854e980595b96716bd68c7825947fc/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/builders.json#L4)\n  -> [@angular/build:application](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6f9a764526854e980595b96716bd68c7825947fc/packages/angular/build/builders.json#L3)\n    -> [angular-cli/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6f9a764526854e980595b96716bd68c7825947fc/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L262)\n      -> [buildApplication](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6f9a764526854e980595b96716bd68c7825947fc/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L150)\n        -> [buildApplicationInternal](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6f9a764526854e980595b96716bd68c7825947fc/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L33)\n\n## ng serve\n\n[@angular-devkit:dev-server](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6f9a764526854e980595b96716bd68c7825947fc/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/builders.json#L20)\n  -> [angular-cli/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/dev-server](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6f9a764526854e980595b96716bd68c7825947fc/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/dev-server/index.ts#L19)\n    -> [angular-cli/packages/angular_devkit/build/src/builders/dev-server/builder.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ec05c814ee0ee444479e22ae767109cace18cb0b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/dev-server/builder.ts#L34)\n      -> [@angular/build/private](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ec05c814ee0ee444479e22ae767109cace18cb0b/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/dev-server/builder.ts#L99)\n        -> [angular-cli/packages/angular/build/src/private.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ec05c814ee0ee444479e22ae767109cace18cb0b/packages/angular/build/src/private.ts#L25)\n          -> [buildApplicationInternal](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6f9a764526854e980595b96716bd68c7825947fc/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L33)\n\nWe see that `buildApplicationInternal` is used in both cases, and this function returns a `result.files` property containing all the output from the build. Great! Exactly what we need.\n\nNow the `result` object here is created by running [`executeBuild`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ec05c814ee0ee444479e22ae767109cace18cb0b/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/execute-build.ts#L41) which builds the application. And one of the functions it executes, is [`executePostBundleStep`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ec05c814ee0ee444479e22ae767109cace18cb0b/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/execute-post-bundle.ts#L46) which in turn builds the @angular/pwa service worker using [`augmentAppwithServiceWorkerEsbuild`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ec05c814ee0ee444479e22ae767109cace18cb0b/packages/angular/build/src/utils/service-worker.ts#L179). This function receives all the outputFiles, assetFiles and the index html file and builds up the service worker.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe need to be able to execute a function at the same spot and with the same type of input at you are giving the `augmentAppWithServiceWorkerEsbuild` function.\n\nMy suggestion is this:\nAllow a `postBundleScript: string` in your options, pointing to a file in the project. This will allow devs to add a function which gets a callback [before or after the point where you build angular sw](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ec05c814ee0ee444479e22ae767109cace18cb0b/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/execute-post-bundle.ts#L229) today. \n\nExample of such a function:\n```typescript\nexport default function postBundle(\n\tworkspaceRoot,\n\tbaseHref,\n\tindexHtmlOutput,\n\toutputFiles,\n\tassetFiles\n) {\n\t// Whatever logic users need to perform at this point\n}\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe've tried to add our [own custom builder](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79374706/how-to-inject-workbox-manifest-in-angular-on-both-build-and-serve-targets), but the results from `executeBuild` is not exposed to other build steps. Exposing those in the results from other builders would of course also be a potential solution. \nToday the result from other builders is always only `{ success: true }`.

If you have unescaped '{', use '{{ \"{\" }}' to escape it.`\nDespite this, the code compiles and runs correctly in the browser. It seems the IDE does not fully recognize the syntax, causing it to misinterpret braces within the template.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n**Component:**\n```ts[]\nimport { Component, Input, signal } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-task-details',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: `\n    @if(task(); as currentTask;) {\n        <div class=\"task-details\">\n            <h2>Task Details</h2>\n            <p><strong>Title:</strong> {{ currentTask.title }}</p>\n            <p><strong>Status:</strong> {{ currentTask.completed ?

Use the provided component code in an Angular 19 standalone project.\n2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.\n3. Observe the error in the IDE.\n\n### Expected Behavior:\nThe IDE should properly recognize and support Angular 19's new `@if` and `@else` syntax without throwing errors.\n\n### Observed Behavior:\nThe IDE flags the syntax as an error, even though the code compiles and runs successfully in the browser.\n\n### Workarounds:\n- Use legacy directives like `*ngIf` until tooling fully supports the new syntax.\n- Temporarily disable linting or inspections for affected code sections in the IDE.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nUnterminated expansion form.

Then we import the npm package in the following way for lazy loading:\r\n```ts\r\n        RouterModule.forChild([\r\n            {\r\n                path: \"lazy\",\r\n                loadChildren: () =>\r\n                    import(\"lazy-module\").then(\r\n                        (m) => m.LazyModule\r\n                    ),\r\n            },\r\n        ]),\r\n```\r\nThis does not work.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe'd like that the following import works:\r\n```ts\r\n        RouterModule.forChild([\r\n            {\r\n                path: \"lazy\",\r\n                loadChildren: () =>\r\n                    import(\"lazy-module\").then( // \"lazy-module\" is an npm package\r\n                        (m) => m.LazyModule\r\n                    ),\r\n            },\r\n        ]),\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nAt the moment, we are using the following workaround.

Unfortunately, when this flag is enabled the zone.js code throws an unexpected error when a non-Error value is rejected, due to the code attempting to set various properties on the rejected value regardless of type: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/31796e8e2fa78fb55ae0c8bf461c4ad742898363/packages/zone.js/lib/common/promise.ts#L209-L212\r\n\r\nFor example, if I reject a Promise with the value \"42\" the following error occurs:\r\n`Error: Cannot create property 'rejection' on number '42'`\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/zonejs-disable-promise-reject-wrapping-issue\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nIf I reject a Promise with the value \"42\" the following error occurs:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n`Error: Cannot create property 'rejection' on number '42'`\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible with any non-error value (number, string, null, etc.)\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\nStackblitz repro is Angular 10, but here is the output from my own project:\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.12\r\nNode: 10.14.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.12\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, language-service, localize\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.12\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.12\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.12 (cli-only)\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.12\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.12\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.12\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nNote that my own project along with the Stackblitz repro are both on zone.js 0.10.3.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38334","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"zone.js incorrectly throws an error when rejecting a Promise with the `DISABLE_WRAPPING_UNCAUGHT_PROMISE_REJECTION` flag enabled\" (#38334)"},{"Id":"672237461","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-03T17:40:32","Actor":"jbogarthyde","Number":"38333","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update API reference doc for Location service","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/service-worker from at least v8.x till latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Nope, as far as i can tell the issue was always there\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Adding the package to an angular app and registering the module via importing\r\n```\r\nServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: environment.production })\r\n```\r\nbreaks the app in safari with error\r\n```\r\nTypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 't.getSubscription')\r\n```\r\nThe error is fired multiple times bringing the app to a crawl and eventually breaking Safari. After a refresh some times you get the following error also\r\n```\r\nMaximum call size exceeded\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nError seems to come from the following line in the package https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/service-worker/src/push.ts#L151\r\nIn constructor of SwPush service the check if service workers is done like this:\r\n```\r\nconstructor(private sw: NgswCommChannel) {\r\n    if (!sw.isEnabled) {\r\n      this.messages = NEVER;\r\n      this.notificationClicks = NEVER;\r\n      this.subscription = NEVER;\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nSpecifically for Safari it is the case that service workers are supported but Push API is not. A check like the following seems to be more complete and would guard against this error:\r\n```\r\nif (!sw.isEnabled && !('PushManager' in window || 'pushManager' in ServiceWorkerRegistration.prototype))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.13\r\nNode: 12.13.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.11\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.803.13\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.803.13\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.803.13\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.803.13\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.3.13\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.3.13\r\n@angular/animations                8.2.14\r\n@angular/cdk                       8.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                       8.3.13\r\n@angular/material                  8.2.3\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   8.2.3\r\n@angular/pwa                       0.901.12\r\n@angular/service-worker            8.2.14\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.3.13\r\n@schematics/angular                8.3.13\r\n@schematics/update                 0.803.13\r\nrxjs                               6.5.4\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.39.2\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I've noticed that, even without making ANY changes to the library code, it will randomly build differently.  I can build it 10 times in a row without making any changes to the code and approximately 50% of the time (or more), it will build in such a way that causes a client application to fail to build.  It's important to note that the library itself always appears to build successfully - it produces no noticeable errors.  I'm using the \"--prod\" flag every time to build it with the View engine instead of Ivy.  However, the code only works when the dist build includes an \"__ivy_ngcc__\" directory and a file that ends with \".__ivy_ngcc_bak\".  There may be other differences in the dist contents as well, but those are the ones that immediately stand out.  If the build process fails to produce output that contains those 2 items, then an Angular app that consumes the library fails to build.  The consuming application produces errors that say:\r\n\r\n`ERROR in The target entry-point \"[library name]\" has missing dependencies:`\r\n\r\nfollowed by a long list of items (services, pipes, interfaces, etc.) from the library that it thinks are \"missing\".\r\n\r\nI can resolve this by simply rebuilding the library, then the client app several times until the library contains the \"ivy_ngcc\" items mentioned above - at which point the client app that consumes the library will build successfully.  Again... it is my understanding that the \"--prod\" flag makes the code build with View, not Ivy.  So I'm not sure why it ever produces the \"ivy_ngcc\" items and I'm not sure why it only works when they are present.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nUnfortunately, my library is almost 100% proprietary code so I can make it publicly available for testing.  However, I can describe the approach that I've taken:\r\n\r\n1) I built a brand new workspace, per the Angular library documentation\r\n2) I added a library to the workspace and added a large number of items (services, etc.), contained in about 6 modules.\r\n3) I added a test application to the workspace, which references the library (directly via filesystem reference - not through NPM yet)\r\n4) I'm simply repeating the following commands to test:\r\n\r\n`ng build my-lib --prod`\r\n\r\n`ng build my-app`\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nNode: 12.7.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.1000.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core               10.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         10.0.4\r\n@angular/cdk                       10.1.1\r\n@angular/cli                       10.0.4\r\n@angular/material                  10.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   10.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular                10.0.4\r\n@schematics/update                 0.1000.4\r\nng-packagr                         10.0.3\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.9.7\r\nwebpack                            4.43.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18430","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Library randomly fails to build consistently, but reports no errors\" (#18430)"},{"Id":"672011471","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-03T19:41:17","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"18429","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update terser to version 5.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18429","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update terser to version 5.0.0\" (#18429)"},{"Id":"671939297","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-03T10:20:04","Actor":"adesogsjean","Number":"18427","RawContent":null,"Title":"> It happen to me today.

However `*ngFor` supports iterables while `*cdkVirtualFor` does not.\r\n\r\nSee https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-bnbcza?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-context-example.html for an example. In the linked example, using `cdkVirtualFor` does not render the set, while `ngFor` does render the set.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nThis would make `cdkVirtualFor` closer to `ngFor`.

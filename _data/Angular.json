Here's a snippet of the code in the Angular service method to get data:\r\n\r\npublic getProfileSettings() {\r\n  return this.http.get(`${this.configService.Config.api}userprofile/profile-settings`).pipe(\r\n    map((response: any) => {\r\n      // my code\r\n      return response;\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn the constructor of the userprofile page, I have something like this:\r\n\r\nthis.clientPanelService.getProfileSettings().subscribe((response) => {\r\n  // fetching data from the backend\r\n});\r\n\r\nOn the userprofile page, I update the data using a POST request. After navigating to another page and then returning to the userprofile page, the getProfileSettings() method is triggered again, but it returns the old cached data from before the update. How can I disable caching for this GET request? This issue started occurring after I updated my Angular application from version 13 to 14.\r\n\r\nEven though I added the headers Cache-Control and Pragma on the server-side C# code, it doesn't seem to help. It looks like the issue may be on the Angular side, as Angular may also have caching headers set that need to be overridden.\r\n\r\nMy response headers:\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, DELETE, OPTIONS\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:4200\r\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate\r\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\r\nDate: Mon, 10 Apr 2023 20:09:26 GMT\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nServer: Kestrel\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\nrequest headers:\r\n\r\nGET /api/v1/userprofile/profile-settings HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/111.0\r\nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*\r\nAccept-Language: en\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\r\nOrigin: http://localhost:4200\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nReferer: http://localhost:4200/\r\nCookie: //cookies\r\nSec-Fetch-Dest: empty\r\nSec-Fetch-Mode: cors\r\nSec-Fetch-Site: same-site\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nCache-Control: no-cache\r\n\r\nThis issue is happening after updating Angular from version 13 to 15 (i checked also on 14 the same problem). If i revert this change back to version 13, everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nWhen inspecting the network tab in the browser's developer tools, there is no new request being made to fetch the data from the backend, but the Angular getProfileSettings() method is being executed and returning outdated data. There are no exceptions or errors, but the request is not returning the latest data, but rather the data that has been cached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 15.2.5\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.6\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.5\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders           15.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/common             15.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     15.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.5\r\nng-packagr                      15.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49772","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"GET Requests Caching Issue\" (#49772)"},{"Id":"1661778596","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-11T05:07:33","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"49775","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.2.11","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v2.2.9` -> `v2.2.11` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action</summary>\n\n### [`v2.2.11`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.10...v2.2.11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.10...v2.2.11)\n\n### [`v2.2.10`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.9...v2.2.10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.2.9...v2.2.10)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm on monday,before 04:00am on tuesday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Lately, we noticed that in real applications it is easily reproducible when you start resource-consuming tasks on your PC.\r\n\r\nStackBlitz example is lightweight, so I had to use CpuKiller 3 application to slow down my CPU enough to reproduce it. I'm able to reproduce it fairly stable when slowdown CPU to 80+%. When I set 98%, I'm able to reproduce it every time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation with logpoints I was able to find that in `cdk/dialog/dialog-ref` it is somehow possible, that `closedSubject.complete()` will not be called immediately after `closedSubject.next(result)`, so 2 different flows are able to execute `next` before subject is completed.\r\nSee code that I'm referring above: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/dialog/dialog-ref.ts#L100\r\n\r\nI get 2 fires from `material/dialog/dialog-ref`:\r\n1. `_ref.overlayRef.detachments().subscribe` - https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/dialog/dialog-ref.ts#L93\r\n2. ` _containerInstance._animationStateChanged` - https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/dialog/dialog-ref.ts#L87\r\n\r\nAlso, I was not able to understand why it is not reproducible on v15.\r\n\r\nCurrent workarounds:\r\n- add `pipe(take(1))` to `afterClosed` subscription - unfortunately, it requires a lot of changes over the app\r\n- remove `detectChanges` from .subscribe, or replace with `markForCheck` - it also requires a lot of changes in the app that may break something.\r\n- Upgrade to v15 :) - it requires upgrading everything\r\n\r\nAny ideas of possible workarounds?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open stackblitz URL https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rro47p\r\n2. Slow down your CPU\r\n3. Click on \"Open dialog\" and then click on \"close\" or outside of the modal\r\n4.

Scrolling up (and up only) is causing the viewport content to disappear and reappear in a glitchy manner. This glitch only happens after scrolling to the BOTTOM of the content after resizing the viewport (or window if it snaps to it), and it persists until the user scrolls to the exact TOP of the viewport. After you scroll completely to the top (with the workaround implemented), the glitchy behavior stops, you can scroll up and down, even to the bottom, and it will work, until the viewport width is resized again, and then the glitch reappears.\r\n- The workaround-glitch does not start happening (nor the one without the workaround) until you actually scroll to the bottom. if you just scroll to the middle, etc, and then up, it behaves normally.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the workaround is not enough and results in horrible UX, especially with large datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Snippets:**\r\n\r\nTemplate:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport\r\n    #accordionVirtualScroller\r\n    autosize\r\n    [style.height]=\"isOutermostInstance ?

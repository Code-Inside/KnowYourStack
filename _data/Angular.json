Same for the mandory super call for derived classes.\r\n\r\nBut in Angular it seems that this does not work. Angular always want the same constructor again and again for every derived class.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport abstract class AbstractMyService {\r\n  constrcutor(private anotherService: AnotherService) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\r\nexport class MyService extends AbstractMyService  {\r\n  /** no empty / useless constructor here. JS handles it. */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut Angular throws an error on runtime: \r\n\r\n> This constructor is not compatible with Angular Dependency Injection because its dependency at index 0 of the parameter list is invalid. This can happen if the dependency type is a primitive like a string or if an ancestor of this class is missing an Angular decorator.\r\n\r\nIt works only if I provide the \"useless\" constructor.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })\r\nexport class MyService extends AbstractMyService  {\r\n  constrcutor(private anotherService: AnotherService) {\r\n    super(anotherService);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBtw. adding `emitDecoratorMetadata` to tsconfig does only change the error message, but does not fix the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular 12.x\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45155","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"This constructor is not compatible with Angular Dependency Injection because its dependency at index 0 of the parameter list is invalid.\" (#45155)"},{"Id":"1145686823","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T12:18:00","Actor":"clemthenem","Number":"45154","RawContent":null,"Title":"DatePipe does not format properly the first day of the year.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe DatePipe does not format properly the first day of the year. \r\nI thought that I messed up timezones etc. but even then, the result should be different.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\n<p>{{\"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\" | date : 'MM/YYYY' }}</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns **01/2021** when we expect **01/2022**.\r\nSame problem with other formats like `dd/MM/YYYY` and different hours.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 12.2.16\r\nNode: 14.17.6\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.15\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.16\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1202.16\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   12.2.16\r\n@angular-devkit/core            12.2.16\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      12.2.16\r\n@angular/cdk                    12.2.13\r\n@angular/google-maps            12.2.13\r\n@angular/material               12.2.13\r\n@schematics/angular             12.2.16\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.3.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this error in various versions: 11, 12 and 13.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45154","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"DatePipe does not format properly the first day of the year.\" (#45154)"},{"Id":"1145568668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T09:57:35","Actor":"digeomel","Number":"45153","RawContent":null,"Title":"tslint replacement","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAlthough tslint is deprecated and the Angular team suggests switching to eslint, our team tried 3-4 times already to switch to the latter and it has always been painful. With the latest release of all packages, Angular 13, eslint 8.9.0, angular-eslint 13.1.0 and typescript-eslint 5.11.0, our project takes around 40 minutes 😱 to lint, which of course makes it impossible to integrate into any CI workflow. The experience is much better on individual files within vscode.\r\n\r\nI've read all the articles about improving the performance, and I tried some solutions without any result, but really, this is a tool that's supposed to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration, we can't spend so much time trying to get it right, especially when tslint just worked.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I noticed that even the Angular and Angular Material teams haven't switched to eslint yet, you're both still on tslint. In fact, I couldn't find any Angular project of considerable size on github that has switched to eslint. Granted, I didn't expect to find any, because I guess Angular is used mostly in corporate environments, intranet applications and so on, so it's difficult to find code hosted on public repos.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSo, perhaps we should revisit the decision to drop tslint or suggest a better alternative? I don't have a suggestion of course, just pointing out the obvious issues.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to hear from people working on big Angular projects, especially with monorepo structures, multiple projects and libraries inside.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\neslint with angular-eslint.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"tslint replacement\" (#45153)"},{"Id":"1145181465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-21T00:22:45","Actor":"bampakoa","Number":"45152","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add Greek localization for Angular Docs","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nWhen using a base href that is different from the current document URL through the `<base href=\"...\">` tag, and using the `HashLocationStrategy`, Angular does not only change the hash when calling `HashLocationStrategy.go`, it appends the new hash to the base href which ends up with a fully different URL.\r\nThis feels wrong, as already discussed in several issues: #36688, #33000\r\nThis PR provides a simpler way to fix these issues, making sure Angular will never change the full URL but only the hash.\r\n\r\nIn addition to changing the URL, `pushState` or `replaceState` (unlike changing the `hash`) makes the request a GET request, which has an impact if the user then refreshes the page, as stated in the specifications:\r\n\r\n> Update entry so that it represents a GET request, if it currently represents a non-GET request (e.g. it was the result of a POST submission).\r\n\r\ncf https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/history.html#dom-history-pushstate\r\n\r\nNote that, or course, instead of implementing this PR, we could also do:\r\n```\r\nwindow.history.pushState = null;\r\n```\r\nBut it is a bit ugly and does not look like an option supported by Angular.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nIf AVOID_PUSH_STATE is set to true, Angular will never call `pushState` or `replaceState` even if the browser supports it and will only change the hash part of the URL through `location.hash = ...`.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45136","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(common): AVOID_PUSH_STATE injection token\" (#45136)"},{"Id":"1142592085","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-18T10:34:31","Actor":"saxibuni","Number":"45132","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix location.search info lose in route change in hash mode","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[`v0.14.23`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01423)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.22...v0.14.23)\n\n-   Update feature database to indicate that node 16.14+ supports import assertions ([#&#8203;2030](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2030))\n\n    Node versions 16.14 and above now support import assertions according to [these release notes](https://togithub.com/nodejs/node/blob/6db686710ee1579452b2908a7a41b91cb729b944/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V16.md#&#8203;16.14.0). This release updates esbuild's internal feature compatibility database with this information, so esbuild no longer strips import assertions with `--target=node16.14`:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import data from './package.json' assert { type: 'json' }\n    console.log(data)\n\n    // Old output (with --target=node16.14)\n    import data from \"./package.json\";\n    console.log(data);\n\n    // New output (with --target=node16.14)\n    import data from \"./package.json\" assert { type: \"json\" };\n    console.log(data);\n    ```\n\n-   Basic support for CSS `@layer` rules ([#&#8203;2027](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2027))\n\n    This adds basic parsing support for a new CSS feature called `@layer` that changes how the CSS cascade works. Adding parsing support for this rule to esbuild means esbuild can now minify the contents of `@layer` rules:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      @&#8203;layer b {\n        div {\n          color: yellow;\n          margin: 0.0px;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a{@&#8203;layer b {div {color: yellow; margin: 0px;}}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b{div{color:#ff0;margin:0}}\n    ```\n\n    You can read more about `@layer` here:\n\n    -   Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/[@&#8203;layer](https://togithub.com/layer)\n    -   Motivation: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/cascade-layers/\n\n    Note that the support added in this release is only for parsing and printing `@layer` rules. The bundler does not yet know about these rules and bundling with `@layer` may result in behavior changes since these new rules have unusual ordering constraints that behave differently than all other CSS rules. Specifically the order is derived from the *first* instance while with every other CSS rule, the order is derived from the *last* instance.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>prettier/eslint-config-prettier</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.0`](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-840-2022-02-19)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/compare/v8.3.0...v8.4.0)\n\n-   Added: \\[vue/quote-props].

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.21...v0.14.22)\n\n-   Preserve whitespace for token lists that look like CSS variable declarations ([#&#8203;2020](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2020))\n\n    Previously esbuild removed the whitespace after the CSS variable declaration in the following CSS:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    @&#8203;supports (--foo: ){html{background:green}}\n\n    /* Previous output */\n    @&#8203;supports (--foo:){html{background:green}}\n    ```\n\n    However, that broke rendering in Chrome as it caused Chrome to ignore the entire rule. This did not break rendering in Firefox and Safari, so there's a browser bug either with Chrome or with both Firefox and Safari. In any case, esbuild now preserves whitespace after the CSS variable declaration in this case.\n\n-   Ignore legal comments when merging adjacent duplicate CSS rules ([#&#8203;2016](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2016))\n\n    This release now generates more compact minified CSS when there are legal comments in between two adjacent rules with identical content:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    a { color: red }\n    /* @&#8203;preserve */\n    b { color: red }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    a{color:red}/* @&#8203;preserve */b{color:red}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    a,b{color:red}/* @&#8203;preserve */\n    ```\n\n-   Block `onResolve` and `onLoad` until `onStart` ends ([#&#8203;1967](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1967))\n\n    This release changes the semantics of the `onStart` callback. All `onStart` callbacks from all plugins are run concurrently so that a slow plugin doesn't hold up the entire build. That's still the case. However, previously the only thing waiting for the `onStart` callbacks to finish was the end of the build. This meant that `onResolve` and/or `onLoad` callbacks could sometimes run before `onStart` had finished. This was by design but violated user expectations. With this release, all `onStart` callbacks must finish before any `onResolve` and/or `onLoad` callbacks are run.\n\n-   Add a self-referential `default` export to the JS API ([#&#8203;1897](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1897))\n\n    Some people try to use esbuild's API using `import esbuild from 'esbuild'` instead of `import * as esbuild from 'esbuild'` (i.e. using a default import instead of a namespace import). There is no `default` export so that wasn't ever intended to work. But it would work sometimes depending on which tools you used and how they were configured so some people still wrote code this way. This release tries to make that work by adding a self-referential `default` export that is equal to esbuild's module namespace object.\n\n    More detail: The published package for esbuild's JS API is in CommonJS format, although the source code for esbuild's JS API is in ESM format. The original ESM code for esbuild's JS API has no export named `default` so using a default import like this doesn't work with Babel-compatible toolchains (since they respect the semantics of the original ESM code). However, it happens to work with node-compatible toolchains because node's implementation of importing CommonJS from ESM broke compatibility with existing conventions and automatically creates a `default` export which is set to `module.exports`. This is an unfortunate compatibility headache because it means the `default` import only works sometimes. This release tries to fix this by explicitly creating a self-referential `default` export. It now doesn't matter if you do `esbuild.build()`, `esbuild.default.build()`, or `esbuild.default.default.build()` because they should all do the same thing. Hopefully this means people don't have to deal with this problem anymore.\n\n-   Handle `write` errors when esbuild's child process is killed ([#&#8203;2007](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2007))\n\n    If you type Ctrl+C in a terminal when a script that uses esbuild's JS library is running, esbuild's child process may be killed before the parent process. In that case calls to the `write()` syscall may fail with an `EPIPE` error. Previously this resulted in an uncaught exception because esbuild didn't handle this case. Starting with this release, esbuild should now catch these errors and redirect them into a general `The service was stopped` error which should be returned from whatever top-level API calls were in progress.\n\n-   Better error message when browser WASM bugs are present ([#&#8203;1863](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1863))\n\n    Safari's WebAssembly implementation appears to be broken somehow, at least when running esbuild. Sometimes this manifests as a stack overflow and sometimes as a Go panic. Previously a Go panic resulted in the error message `Can't find variable: fs` but this should now result in the Go panic being printed to the console. Using esbuild's WebAssembly library in Safari is still broken but now there's a more helpful error message.\n\n    More detail: When Go panics, it prints a stack trace to stderr (i.e. file descriptor 2). Go's WebAssembly shim calls out to node's `fs.writeSync()` function to do this, and it converts calls to `fs.writeSync()` into calls to `console.log()` in the browser by providing a shim for `fs`. However, Go's shim code stores the shim on `window.fs` in the browser. This is undesirable because it pollutes the global scope and leads to brittle code that can break if other code also uses `window.fs`. To avoid this, esbuild shadows the global object by wrapping Go's shim. But that broke bare references to `fs` since the shim is no longer stored on `window.fs`. This release now stores the shim in a local variable named `fs` so that bare references to `fs` work correctly.\n\n-   Undo incorrect dead-code elimination with destructuring ([#&#8203;1183](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1183))\n\n    Previously esbuild eliminated these statements as dead code if tree-shaking was enabled:\n\n    ```js\n    let [a] = {}\n    let { b } = null\n    ```\n\n    This is incorrect because both of these lines will throw an error when evaluated. With this release, esbuild now preserves these statements even when tree shaking is enabled.\n\n-   Update to Go 1.17.7\n\n    The version of the Go compiler used to compile esbuild has been upgraded from Go 1.17.6 to Go 1.17.7, which contains a few [compiler and security bug fixes](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.17.7+label%3ACherryPickApproved).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>expressjs/express</summary>\n\n### [`v4.17.3`](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/blob/HEAD/History.md#&#8203;4173--2022-02-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/compare/4.17.2...4.17.3)\n\n\\===================\n\n-   deps: accepts@~1.3.8\n    -   deps: mime-types@~2.1.34\n    -   deps: negotiator@0.6.3\n-   deps: body-parser@1.19.2\n    -   deps: bytes@3.1.2\n    -   deps: qs@6.9.7\n    -   deps: raw-body@2.4.3\n-   deps: cookie@0.4.2\n-   deps: qs@6.9.7\n    -   Fix handling of `__proto__` keys\n-   pref: remove unnecessary regexp for trust proxy\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v13.0.2`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1302-httpswwwgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1301v1302-2022-02-16)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v13.0.1...v13.0.2)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>csstools/postcss-plugins</summary>\n\n### [`v7.4.1`](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/blob/HEAD/plugin-packs/postcss-preset-env/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;741-February-17-2022)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/compare/5f631c0b3f1b090d42d0a6b6f9cb2fa76d3db897...de478b9e5773f9af757c12197f817b251274b65e)\n\n-   Updated `postcss-clamp` to `4.0.0` (major)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack</summary>\n\n### [`v5.69.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.69.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.69.0...v5.69.1)\n\n### Revert\n\n-   revert \"handle multiple alternative directories (e. g. due to resolve.alias or resolve.modules) when creating an context module\"\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

After some learning time, I've come to realize what a great tool Angular Schematics is! In my opinion, one thing is missing though: the templating part of the tool could really benefit from a Language Service with code completion based on what we make available for the templates or even a small language support plugin.\r\n\r\nIn VSCode, the '*.template' files are shown as raw text and even if I configure the IDE to understand them as the proper typings (.ts, for instance), it explodes with errors (rightfully, of course, since the imports and templating syntax won't be recognized).\r\n\r\nI think better IDE support could really improve Schematics developer experience and increase its usage in the community, which would be great since it's such an amazing tool!\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtend Angular Language Service to deal with the '.template' files. As they are only templates, I don't see a way to provide full Typescript support within the files, but maybe there's a way to at least format/color the code for a better developing experience.\r\n\r\nAs for the templating syntax, it would be great to have code completion and info based on what is passed to the `applyTemplates` function. Real-time info on the variations of templating syntax (`<%`, `<%-`, `<%=`) would help a lot too!\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI've looked for community plugins, with no success. Right now, I'm using the EJS Language support plugin, which gives the templating syntax some coloring.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46810","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Language Service for Angular Schematics template files\" (#46810)"},{"Id":"1302522749","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T20:37:03","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"46808","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove `destroy` from the EnvironmentInjector's public API","State":"closed","Body":"This commit updates the `EnvironmentInjector` class to annotate the `destroy` method as internal.

[es-module-loader](https://togithub.com/ModuleLoader/es-module-loader).\nIt remains as backwards-compatible as possible, while also tracking the changes of direction\nthat have been happening at the specification level.\n\nThere are a number of breaking changes and deprecations as listed below.\n\nTo upgrade, first run SystemJS 0.19 with System.config({ warnings: true }) and fix all the deprecation\nwarnings first before running SystemJS 0.20.\n\nThe corresponding release of SystemJS Builder is available at https://github.com/systemjs/builder/releases/tag/0.16.0.\n\n*For background on this release, see the blog post at http://guybedford.com/systemjs-alignment.*\n\nNew Features:\n\n-   Improved performance and reduced file size.\n-   Supports the dynamic import('./module.js') syntax in modules, when\n    transpiled with the Babel system module format with the babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import plugin enabled (alternatively this support is also provided by the SystemJS babel plugin).\n-   Supports automatically loading Web Assembly when enabled via the flag System.config({ wasm: true })\n-   New small optimized production build (5KB) for just loading System.register modules with baseURL, paths, map, contextual map, bundles, depCache and wasm support.\n-   Normalization is now fully idempotent\n-   format: 'system' is supported as an alternative to format: 'register'\n\nBreaking Changes:\n\n-   Removes the ability to use named imports from non-ES modules (eg import {readFile} from 'fs' should be import fs from 'fs'; fs.readFile). This is in order to align with the NodeJS ES module directions ([https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/pull/60](https://togithub.com/nodejs/CTC/pull/60)/files#diff-2b572743d67d8a47685ae4bcb9bec651R217).\n-   Removes support for defaultJSExtensions\n-   Default transpiler loading is removed. It is no longer possible to transpile sources without configuring one of the transpiler plugins.\n-   Setting baseURL directly is no longer supported - use System.config({ baseURL: 'x' }) over System.baseURL = x.\n-   No longer possible to set System.map\\['x'] = 'asdf'. Must use System.config({ map: { x: 'asdf' } }).\n-   Hooks no longer exist (just resolve and instantiate as in es-module-loader). Hooks via plugins still work fine.\n-   Supports IE9+ but scriptLoad support is only included in IE11+\n-   deps is no longer supported for System.register / System.registerDynamic / script load\n-   Global exports metadata as an array will no longer export the default as the first global.\n-   format: 'esm' must now be used instead of format: 'es6'\n-   A bundle with a single named System.register statement will no longer give an anonymous module value\n-   No more special handling of trailing slash in CJS\n-   System.load now does normalization, to match WhatWG spec. This method may well be deprecated as idempotent normalization should make this no longer necessary.\n-   AMD define no longer set by default when using scriptLoad, requires manually setting window.define = System.amdDefine for scriptLoad support of AMD.\n-   The separate SystemCSP and register builds are no longer available\n-   Disables a previous experimental functional return variation of System.register\n-   Alias feature is removed\n-   System and SystemJS globals are no longer defined in NodeJS\n\nBug Fixes\n\n-   depCache now uses link preloading instead of partial execution techniques which have been unreliable.\n\n### [`v0.19.47`](https://togithub.com/systemjs/systemjs/releases/tag/0.19.47)\n\n[Compare

Faced a lot of issues in the interim and had to upgrade a lot of libs and subsequently changed a lot of the application code . Now I feel I am very near to fixing all the issues but yet I am still stumped by one issue due to which my app is not coming up . In my `package.json`, I am using this library : `\"ngx-mydatepicker\": \"^2.4.11\"` . This is currently being imported and used through out the app . This has been added to `app.module.ts` as well like so   :  \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { NgxMyDatePickerModule } from 'ngx-mydatepicker';\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n                 ...........

However , when I try to load my app, I see that the browser console keeps giving me this error :  `Type NgxMyDatePickerModule does not have 'ɵmod' property.` due to which the app does not come up .\r\n\r\n**I tried the following steps but that did not help me  :**  \r\n\r\n1. Tried to move to `angular-mydatepicker` as per the link : [angular-mydatepicker](https://github.com/kekeh/angular-mydatepicker)  . But it was not helpful. Now instead of `ngxMyDatepicker` , I keep getting :  `angular-mydatepicker does not have emod property.`\r\n2. Next I tried using the `ngcc` as a postinstall script like so :   `\"postinstall\": \"ngcc\"` . However , ngcc does not seem to process  `ngxMyDatepicker` as evidenced here :  \r\n\r\n`_> ngcc\r\n\r\nProcessing legacy \"View Engine\" libraries:\r\n- angular-draggable-droppable [fesm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-draggable-droppable.git)\r\n- angular-resizable-element [fesm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-resizable-element.git)\r\n- @ng-idle/core [fesm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/moribvndvs/ng2-idle.git)\r\n- ng2-completer [es2015/esm2015] (oferh/ng2-completer)\r\n- ngx-order-pipe [es2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/VadimDez/ngx-order-pipe.git)\r\n- angular-calendar [fesm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar.git)\r\n- angular-draggable-droppable [fesm5/esm5] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-draggable-droppable.git)\r\n- angular-draggable-droppable [esm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-draggable-droppable.git)\r\n- @ng-idle/keepalive [fesm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/moribvndvs/ng2-idle.git)\r\n- @ng-idle/core [esm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/moribvndvs/ng2-idle.git)\r\n- @ng-idle/keepalive [esm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/moribvndvs/ng2-idle.git)\r\n- @ng-idle/core [main/umd] (git+https://github.com/moribvndvs/ng2-idle.git)\r\n- @ng-idle/keepalive [main/umd] (git+https://github.com/moribvndvs/ng2-idle.git)\r\n- angular-draggable-droppable [esm5/esm5] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-draggable-droppable.git)\r\n- angular-resizable-element [fesm5/esm5] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-resizable-element.git)\r\n- angular-draggable-droppable [main/umd] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-draggable-droppable.git)\r\n- angular-resizable-element [esm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-resizable-element.git)\r\n- angular-resizable-element [esm5/esm5] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-resizable-element.git)\r\n- angular-resizable-element [main/umd] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-resizable-element.git)\r\n- angular-calendar [fesm5/esm5] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar.git)\r\n- angular-calendar [esm2015/esm2015] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar.git)\r\n- angular-calendar [esm5/esm5] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar.git)\r\n- angular-calendar [main/umd] (git+https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar.git)\r\n- ng2-completer [main/umd] (oferh/ng2-completer)\r\n- ng2-completer [module/esm5] (oferh/ng2-completer)\r\n- ngx-order-pipe [main/umd] (git+https://github.com/VadimDez/ngx-order-pipe.git)\r\n- ngx-order-pipe [module/esm5] (git+https://github.com/VadimDez/ngx-order-pipe.git)\r\nEncourage the library authors to publish an Ivy distribution._`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Any suggestions as to what I can do here  ?**\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nUncaught Error: Type NgxMyDatePickerModule does not have 'ɵmod' property.\r\n    at getNgModuleDef (core.mjs?b55c:1139:1)\r\n    at recurse (core.mjs?b55c:21827:1)\r\n    at recurse (core.mjs?b55c:21838:1)\r\n    at registerNgModuleType (core.mjs?b55c:21823:1)\r\n    at new NgModuleFactory (core.mjs?b55c:21945:1)\r\n    at compileNgModuleFactory (core.mjs?b55c:25990:1)\r\n    at PlatformRef.bootstrapModule (core.mjs?b55c:26233:1)\r\n    at eval (main.ts?4a58:11:1)\r\n    at ./src/main.ts (app.js:4049:1)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (app.js:4444:33)\r\n    at app.js:5598:37\r\n    at app.js:5600:12\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.8\r\nNode: 14.16.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.12\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1303.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core         13.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   13.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                 13.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular          13.3.8\r\nrxjs                         6.6.7\r\ntypescript                   4.7.4\r\nwebpack                      5.73.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46796","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Upgrading Angular from version 12 to 13 :  Type NgxMyDatePickerModule does not have 'ɵmod' property.\" (#46796)"},{"Id":"1301884851","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T11:48:55","Actor":"JiaLinYou","Number":"46797","RawContent":null,"Title":"AOT Cannot assign value \"$event\" to template variable \"item\".

The in-browser stuff doesn't work very well when the compilation is super-slow like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.5\r\nNode: 14.19.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.17 \r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.5\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.5.6\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI filed an earlier bug that was closed due to lack of repro, which may have had some relevant info here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46790\r\n\r\nTypeScript bug I had filed initially since stack traces were leading into TS-land:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49845","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46792","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TypeScript 4.7.4: strict / full template type checks slow down exponentially with complex ngIf expressions\" (#46792)"},{"Id":"1301303319","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-11T22:50:31","Actor":"imirkin","Number":"46790","RawContent":null,"Title":"Infinite loop in typescript compiler when fullTemplateTypeCheck is enabled","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWith Angular 14.0.5 and TypeScript 4.6.4, everything is fine. When upgrading to TypeScript 4.7.4, I get an infinite loop. Disabling `fullTemplateTypeCheck` \"fixes\" this. I originally filed this as a TypeScript issue here: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49845 to get assistance in debugging, which has led me here.\r\n\r\nThe template in question has something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n<component #asdf *ngIf=\"someBool && a.length == 0 && b.length == 0 && c.length == 0 && d.length == 0 && ... && z.length == 0\" [input]=\"b\" />\r\n<component #asdf *ngIf=\"a.length > 0\"/>\r\n<component #asdf *ngIf=\"b.length > 0\"/>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nReducing this to a handful of conditions, and it all works fine. Perhaps it's a N^2 issue somewhere? I did let it run for quite a while and it didn't seem to complete.\r\n\r\nYou can see some sample stacktraces in the referenced TypeScript issue, basically things in checkExpression().

when direct `eval` is present ([#&#8203;2361](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2361))\n\n    Version 0.14.19 of esbuild added inlining of certain `const` variables during minification, which replaces all references to the variable with the initializer and then removes the variable declaration. However, this could generate incorrect code when direct `eval` is present because the direct `eval` could reference the constant by name. This release fixes the problem by preserving the `const` variable declaration in this case:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log((() => { const x = 123; return x + eval('x') }))\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    console.log(()=>123+eval(\"x\"));\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    console.log(()=>{const x=123;return 123+eval(\"x\")});\n    ```\n\n-   Fix an incorrect error in TypeScript when targeting ES5 ([#&#8203;2375](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2375))\n\n    Previously when compiling TypeScript code to ES5, esbuild could incorrectly consider the following syntax forms as a transformation error:\n\n    ```ts\n    0 ? ([]) : 1 ? ({}) : 2;\n    ```\n\n    The error messages looked like this:\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Transforming destructuring to the configured target environment (\"es5\") is not supported yet\n\n            example.ts:1:5:\n              1 │ 0 ? ([]) : 1 ? ({}) : 2;\n                ╵      ^\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Transforming destructuring to the configured target environment (\"es5\") is not supported yet\n\n            example.ts:1:16:\n              1 │ 0 ? ([]) : 1 ? ({}) : 2;\n                ╵                 ^\n\n    These parenthesized literals followed by a colon look like the start of an arrow function expression followed by a TypeScript return type (e.g. `([]) : 1` could be the start of the TypeScript arrow function `([]): 1 => 1`). Unlike in JavaScript, parsing arrow functions in TypeScript requires backtracking. In this case esbuild correctly determined that this expression wasn't an arrow function after all but the check for destructuring was incorrectly not covered under the backtracking process. With this release, the error message is now only reported if the parser successfully parses an arrow function without backtracking.\n\n-   Fix generated TypeScript `enum` comments containing `*/` ([#&#8203;2369](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2369), [#&#8203;2371](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2371))\n\n    TypeScript `enum` values that are equal to a number or string literal are inlined (references to the enum are replaced with the literal value) and have a `/* ... */` comment after them with the original enum name to improve readability. However, this comment is omitted if the enum name contains the character sequence `*/` because that would end the comment early and cause a syntax error:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript\n    enum Foo { '/*' = 1, '*/' = 2 }\n    console.log(Foo['/*'], Foo['*/'])\n\n    // Generated JavaScript\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2);\n    ```\n\n    This was originally handled correctly when TypeScript `enum` inlining was initially implemented since it was only supported within a single file. However, when esbuild was later extended to support TypeScript `enum` inlining across files, this special case where the enum name contains `*/` was not handled in that new code. Starting with this release, esbuild will now handle enums with names containing `*/` correctly when they are inlined across files:\n\n    ```ts\n    // foo.ts\n    export enum Foo { '/*' = 1, '*/' = 2 }\n\n    // bar.ts\n    import { Foo } from './foo'\n    console.log(Foo['/*'], Foo['*/'])\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle --format=esm)\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2 /* */ */);\n\n    // New output (with --bundle --format=esm)\n    console.log(1 /* /* */, 2);\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n-   Allow `declare` class fields to be initialized ([#&#8203;2380](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2380))\n\n    This release fixes an oversight in the TypeScript parser that disallowed initializers for `declare` class fields. TypeScript actually allows the following limited initializer expressions for `readonly` fields:\n\n    ```ts\n    declare const enum a { b = 0 }\n\n    class Foo {\n      // These are allowed by TypeScript\n      declare readonly a = 0\n      declare readonly b = -0\n      declare readonly c = 0n\n      declare readonly d = -0n\n      declare readonly e = 'x'\n      declare readonly f = `x`\n      declare readonly g = a.b\n      declare readonly h = a['b']\n\n      // These are not allowed by TypeScript\n      declare readonly x = (0)\n      declare readonly y = null\n      declare readonly z = -a.b\n    }\n    ```\n\n    So with this release, esbuild now allows initializers for `declare` class fields too. To future-proof this in case TypeScript allows more expressions as initializers in the future (such as `null`), esbuild will allow any expression as an initializer and will leave the specifics of TypeScript's special-casing here to the TypeScript type checker.\n\n-   Fix a bug in esbuild's feature compatibility table generator ([#&#8203;2365](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2365))\n\n    Passing specific JavaScript engines to esbuild's `--target` flag restricts esbuild to only using JavaScript features that are supported on those engines in the output files that esbuild generates. The data for this feature is automatically derived from this compatibility table with a script: https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/.\n\n    However, the script had a bug that could incorrectly consider a JavaScript syntax feature to be supported in a given engine even when it doesn't actually work in that engine. Specifically this bug happened when a certain aspect of JavaScript syntax has always worked incorrectly in that engine and the bug in that engine has never been fixed. This situation hasn't really come up before because previously esbuild pretty much only targeted JavaScript engines that always fix their bugs, but the two new JavaScript engines that were added in the previous release ([Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) and [Rhino](https://togithub.com/mozilla/rhino)) have many aspects of the JavaScript specification that have never been implemented, and may never be implemented. For example, the `let` and `const` keywords are not implemented correctly in those engines.\n\n    With this release, esbuild's compatibility table generator script has been fixed and as a result, esbuild will now correctly consider a JavaScript syntax feature to be unsupported in a given engine if there is some aspect of that syntax that is broken in all known versions of that engine. This means that the following JavaScript syntax features are no longer considered to be supported by these engines (represented using esbuild's internal names for these syntax features):\n\n    Hermes:\n\n    -   `arrow`\n    -   `const-and-let`\n    -   `default-argument`\n    -   `generator`\n    -   `optional-catch-binding`\n    -   `optional-chain`\n    -   `rest-argument`\n    -   `template-literal`\n\n    Rhino:\n\n    -   `arrow`\n    -   `const-and-let`\n    -   `destructuring`\n    -   `for-of`\n    -   `generator`\n    -   `object-extensions`\n    -   `template-literal`\n\n    IE:\n\n    -   `const-and-let`\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>microsoft/node-jsonc-parser</summary>\n\n### [`v3.1.0`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/node-jsonc-parser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;310-2022-07-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/microsoft/node-jsonc-parser/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0)\n\n\\==================\n\n-   added new API `FormattingOptions.keepLines` : It leaves the initial line positions in the formatting\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/postcss-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;701-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribpostcss-loadercomparev700v701-2022-07-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.13.2`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/tag/v5.13.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.13.1...v5.13.2)\n\n##### [5.13.2](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.13.1...v5.13.2) (2022-07-12)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **deps:** update dependency [@&#8203;verdaccio/ui-theme](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/ui-theme) to v6.0.0-6-next.25 ([#&#8203;3258](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3258)) ([af9cc6d](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/af9cc6d4f993d07e396a0391f3a964b0c7d36268))\n-   update nodejs to 14.20.0 to fix CVE-2022-32212 ([#&#8203;3262](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/3262)) ([5f83dc2](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/commit/5f83dc294e763d578b5d9f95cfee00e44fa6fd6e)) by [@&#8203;limmesberger](https://togithub.com/limmesberger)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Arabic. This is now easily configurable when we set the locale to Arabic but doing this we also do change it to using Lunar calendar rather then the Gregorian calendar.\r\n\r\nAn example behavior that I get with this is the following \r\n\r\nE.g. The DatePicker is showing Friday 25 March as the date, but the dropdown picker highlights 27th of Jamadi Akhar (6th lunar month), and showing on top right 22/8/1443. FYI 25 March 2022 = 22/8/1443, and the 8th lunar month is shaban\r\n\r\nSo I would like to have a configuration option so that we I am able to set the type of calendar I want to use.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. { provide: MAT_DATE_LOCALE, useFactory 'ar-AR' }\r\n2. Use Angular material Date picker \r\n3.  Set 25-th March as default date \r\n4. When you open the page to view the calendar it is showing Friday 25th March (in arabic) but the dropdown picker highlights 27th of Jamadi Akhar (6th lunar month) and showing on top right 22/8/1443.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nUse the Gregorian calendar for all localizations unless specified otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen using Arabic for localization for the calendar I would expect for the Gregorian month names and weekday names to be translated.\r\n\r\nThe value of the date and the selected date in the dropdown picker which is highlighted should match.\r\n\r\nThis would be good if we have the option to configure the the type of calendar.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11095190/178537168-03f4f676-324e-41cb-9450-a532f2c474c8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 14.0.3,\r\n-Angular/cli: 14.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.3\r\n- Browser(s): All Browsers and Devices\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25263","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improvement (Datepicker): Having a gregorian calendar even when locale is set to Arabic\" (#25263)"},{"Id":"1302220316","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T15:24:45","Actor":"adzhiljano","Number":"25262","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Dialog): Explicit injector does not work","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHey, I recently updated to v14 just for the newly added feature of the Dialog - the explicit injector, but it does not seem to work.

And since that's where I run `updateSize()` and `updatePosition()`. The dialog ends up looking like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5993909/178484322-8794ebc8-650e-429f-8276-9a00a269dda6.png)\r\n\r\nIf I run `this.cd.markForCheck()` after the dialog code the observer is called, so it definitely has something to do with Change Detection. However this is a feasible solution since I open the dialogs from a common services, where injecting ChangeDetectionref is not possible.\r\n\r\n`this.applicationRef.tick();` does not help (I thought this was a Global Change detection tick?)\r\n\r\nThe reason I think Change detection is not working properly is because we use native async/await.\r\nHowever I use the `zone.run()` code for that reason:\r\n```\r\nreturn this.zone.run(() => {\r\n            const dialog = this.matDialog.open<T>(template, { ...config, viewContainerRef: !useGlobalViewRef ? this.viewContainerRef : undefined });\r\n            dialog.afterOpened().subscribe(() => {\r\n                if (!config.width) {\r\n                    dialog.updateSize();\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                if (!config.position) {\r\n                    dialog.updatePosition();\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n            return dialog;\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I still get the issue. This code responsible for calling the `afterOpened` observer is never reached:\r\n```\r\n_containerInstance._animationStateChanged.pipe((0,WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_8__.filter)(event => event.state === 'opened'), (0,WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_9__.take)(1)).subscribe(() => {\r\n      this._afterOpened.next();\r\n\r\n      this._afterOpened.complete();\r\n    }); // Dispose overlay when closing animation is complete\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the dialog is created, opened and visible on screen. But the `_animationStateChanged` event does not seem to happen, which causes the `afterOpened` observable to never be \"called\".\r\n\r\nShould it be this dependent on Change detection to work? And why does running it in the zone not make the internal `Change Detection` in the `MatDialog` component to work?\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nN/A\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `afterOpened()` observer should be \"called\"\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `afterOpened()` observer is not called due to some animationStateChange not being triggered due to Change Detection issues.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 14.0.1\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.1 \r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core \r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1400.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1302.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              14.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        14.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  14.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               14.0.1\r\nng-packagr                        14.0.2\r\nrxjs                              7.5.5\r\ntypescript                        4.7.3\r\nwebpack                           5.73.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25261","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatDialog): afterOpened is not always called, probably due to change detection issues\" (#25261)"},{"Id":"1301967400","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T12:05:39","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25260","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dependency Dashboard","State":"open","Body":"This issue lists Renovate updates and detected dependencies.

Some suggestions:\r\n\r\n- The stackblitz is very very hard to read. There is one .ts file with 2 components and 3 classes, and one of the components in the file references a separate template file with a completely different name. Why not just use another file altogether for the .ts and use the same name as the template?\r\n- The accessibility section briefly mentions things like setDescribedByIds(), but the actual implementation doesn't even use many things mentioned (and when I tried to use the exact example, was met with many errors I couldn't get past).\r\n- accommodate strict typescript settings, which many people use/are forced to use at work. I ran into many problems with this. Many @Inputs needed to be initialized, and I wasn't sure if I should just use the safe navigation or non-null assertion operators. I think the official documentation should be using the strictest forms of typechecking/null checking instead of the many \"any\" types that are so often used (not in this guide, but elsewhere in angular docs).

But once it does support `exports`, I believe the styles path in https://github.com/angular/components/blob/b5c935ad3f187e86aa0748cb439e793edd8b37cb/src/material/schematics/ng-add/theming/theming.ts#L111 will need to be adjusted to something like `\"@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\"`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNg Add should create a configuration that is compatible with yarn pnp\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt doesn't currently.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.0.5\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25242","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(schematics): ng-add prebuilt styles config isn't compatible with yarn pnp\" (#25242)"},{"Id":"1297960520","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-07T22:48:22","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"25240","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add tooltip example to mdc-migration integration test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25240","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add tooltip example to mdc-migration integration test\" (#25240)"},{"Id":"1297926676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-07T19:10:36","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"25239","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add tabs example to mdc-migration integration test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25239","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add tabs example to mdc-migration integration test\" (#25239)"},{"Id":"1297089914","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-07T09:26:21","Actor":"muneebkq","Number":"25238","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material-autocomplete): (overlayOutsideClick) condradicts with (optionSelected)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwhenever i select an option from autocomplete panel the overlayOutsideClick function of overlay gets called which closes everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mtmkgh?file=src/app/app.component.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

After enough time has elapsed, or after you've restarted the app an arbitrary amount of times, it will eventually get into the memory leaking state\r\n    - therefore, if my coworkers and I download the repo, then run the app, it seems to be a coin toss on whether or not this bug gets reproduced right away\r\n    - if you're one of the lucky few that doesn't get it to happen right away, perhaps try it on a different computer, or wait a couple minutes and refresh the web app a couple times\r\n- the fact that it doesn't happen first try every time makes it hard to prove that their is a bug with this minimal reproduction app\r\n    - I've included screen shots in the stack overflow post (near the bottom), that proves that this is indeed happening\r\n    - it does however happen every time with a much larger production app that I'm working on\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kevinpbaker/angular-memory-killer\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nThere is no error thrown. The components in memory aren't being garbage collected, and will eventually crash the browser window.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nI have upgraded this project to be the latest version of angular 12, and the latest version of angular 13, and it leaks in 11, 12, and 13.

As in most common angular applications, we have a global stylesheet in which we import the aforementioned dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to Angular v13 and its toolchain, we noticed an unexpected increase in the production mode bundle size. Inspecting the build stats, we found out that such increase was concentrated in the main `styles.css` file. With a deeper inspection in the minified file, we found out that many of the global imports were duplicated in the output stylesheet.\r\n\r\nFor us, this is a regression, since before the upgrade this duplication did not occur.\r\n\r\nThe link below brings to a Github repository where we demonstrate the issue with a simple `@angular/material` import. The branches are organized as follows:\r\n\r\n`master` -> Angular 12, works as expected\r\n`feature/angular-13` -> Angular 13, duplicate entries in built style.css\r\n\r\nWe can also provide the unminified versions of the built styles.css bundles (v12 and v13, ready to be compared). Built from the same sources, the v13 indeed does have duplicate rules, while the v12 does not.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/ibanjo/angular13-duplicate-styles-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo exception, just an unexpected increase in the bundle size due to duplicate style rules.

This causes a CORS error when `<base href=\"\">` inside `index.html` is set to a assets server(for ex: http://127.0.0.1:8443/static/), and `index.html` is loaded over another server(for ex: http://127.0.0.1:8080).\r\n\r\n```\r\nAccess to script at 'http://localhost:8443/static/main.js' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven if `type=\"module\"` from the `<script/>` tag is removed, all the other JS chunks (for ex: `663.js`) which are loaded in `main.js` or `runtime.js` are still showing CORS error.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n1. Create a demo angular app using angular cli 13.\r\n2. Add `baseHref` option as empty string(for now) in angular.json.\r\n3. Build the app\r\n    ```\r\n    npm run build -- --configuration development\r\n    ```\r\n4. After building the app, separate out all the JS builds(runtime.js, main.js etc) in one folder and `index.html` in another folder.\r\n5. Download `live-server`\r\n    ```\r\n    npm install -g live-server\r\n    ```\r\n    **Note**: You can use any other way to serve `index.html` and all other JS builds from other server with different domain.\r\n6. Run `live-server` command in the folder containing JS bundles and the note the URL.\r\n7. In the `index.html`, Update `<base href>` tag with URL in step 6, and run the `live-server` command.\r\n8. Assuming the folder containing `index.html` is served through `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html` and you should be able to see the CORS error in the console.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.0.2\r\nNode: 16.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1300.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                    13.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             13.0.2\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.4.4\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

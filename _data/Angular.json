See the\r\nadded tests for details on the types of semantics we can now recover;\r\nin particular, notice that some assumptions are made about the form of\r\na keyed read/write intended by a user. For example, in the malformed\r\nexpression `a[1 + = 2`, we assume that the user meant to write a binary\r\nexpression for the key of `a`, and assign that key the value `2`. In\r\nparticular, we now parse this as `a[1 + <empty expression>] = 2`. There\r\nare some different interpretations that can be made here, but I think\r\nthis is reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe actual changes in the parser code are fairly minimal (a nice\r\nsurprise!); the biggest addition is a `writeContext` that marks whether\r\nthe `=` operator can serve as a recovery point after error detection.\r\n\r\nPart of #38596\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Feature","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39004","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(compiler): Recover on malformed keyed reads and keyed writes\" (#39004)"},{"Id":"709310017","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-25T22:04:11","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"39003","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n cleanup 4","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I have also a button attached to the form container which should be disabled if the form (in the form container) is invalid. The problem is that the form container is valid, although the parent form and its child are invalid. \r\n\r\nOnce I attach any validator to the parent form, the invalid event will be propagated to the form container. I'm not sure if it's a bug but I would expect that if the both forms are invalid (parent and child), the status should be also propagated to the form container and it's not. It's only propagated once the parent form has a validator attached. \r\n\r\nI prepared a stackblitz so that you can reproduce the issue.

One of the approaches I'm using is async imports (eg `import('../foo/foo.module').then(m => m.FooModule)`) shortly after the app is loaded, for logic that isn't absolutely required for initial load + first render.\r\n\r\nWhile we use angular animations extensively (because it's awesome!), we don't need it for first page view (relying on CSS animations for the first few seconds). It is currently not possible to move the `BrowserAnimationsModule` import to a different module from where `BrowserModule` is imported - because `BrowserAnimationModule` exports `BrowserModule`, and the `BrowserModule` constructor requires that `BrowserModule` hasn't been loaded in a parent injector. Also, angular won't start if `BrowserModule` isn't imported by the root module.\r\n\r\nI would like the ability to delay load `BrowserAnimationsModule`, and I think this would be a useful ability for anyone working to speed initial load.\r\n\r\nThe easiest repro is to create a new project using `ng new --strict --minimal`. Next, `ng build --prod` gives me a main bundle size of 187kB.\r\n\r\nIf I'm going to use @angular/animations in my app, I am currently required to import `BrowserAnimationsModule` in the root module:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [\r\n    AppComponent\r\n  ],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BrowserModule,\r\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\r\n    AppRoutingModule\r\n  ],\r\n  providers: [],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust doing this increases the main bundle to `258 kB` (+71kB or +38%).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to initialize the BrowserAnimationsModule shortly after app load, and have animations work after that point:\r\n\r\n`\r\nawait delay(1000);\r\nimport('@angular/platform-browser/animations').then(m => m.BrowserAnimationsModule );\r\n`\r\n\r\nThis will probably require that the `BrowserAnimationsModule` no longer re-export `BrowserModule`.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThe current required configuration works, it just adds unnecessary size to the initial bundle.\r\n\r\nI did try directly importing `BROWSER_ANIMATIONS_PROVIDERS` (which would get around the `BrowserModule` re-import check), but I couldn't access them.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to fork the angular code and try to create a new version of BrowserAnimationsModule that doesn't have these limitations, but I haven't gotten desparate enough for that. We'll see what the Angular team thinks about this proposal.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38982","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make BrowserAnimationsModule delay-loadable\" (#38982)"},{"Id":"708310063","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-24T16:26:14","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"38978","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(zone.js): rename BlacklistedStackFrames to InternalZoneJsStackFrames","State":"open","Body":"BlacklistedStackFrames to InternalZoneJsStackFrames along with other related\r\nsymbols renamed with the same changes (with appropriate casing style).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38978","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(zone.js): rename BlacklistedStackFrames to InternalZoneJsStackFrames\" (#38978)"},{"Id":"708308478","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-24T16:23:46","Actor":"ayazhafiz","Number":"38977","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): iteratively parse interpolations","State":"open","Body":"This patch refactors the interpolation parser to do so iteratively\r\nrather than using a regex.

In the refactor commit mentioned above, it looks like the code changed from `delete argv['_']` to `argv['_']=[]`, this looks to be the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nI did try reverting the line back to delete and the serve worked as expected.   This could affect other targets, it just manifested under the serve target for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n## ð¬ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include:

It's also fairly easy to imagine another user who might have multiple videos displayed on the page in different components and re-load this script as a result of that.\r\n\r\nI've solved this for my own use, however I feel that it would be wise and helpful to guide new implementers towards this as well.\r\n\r\nOne potential solution to this would be to recommend hardcode adding the script at a global level. However, it's possible that the developer may not have access to this (for whatever reason), and makes the implementation of this grow beyond the immediate component. This would also slow the initial load time of the app (slightly).\r\n\r\nA better solution, I feel, would be to recommend checking against the document if the script already exists, and only adding it if it doesn't exist yet. ie:\r\n```\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    // This code loads the IFrame Player API code asynchronously, according to the instructions at\r\n    // https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Getting_Started\r\n    if (document && document.body && document.body.querySelector && !document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]') {\r\n      const tag = document.createElement('script');\r\n\r\n      tag.src = \"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\";\r\n      document.body.appendChild(tag);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven better still, would be to encourage use of Angular/Common's Document Injection, rather than accessing the document directly. ie:\r\n```\r\n// example-module.ts\r\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\r\nimport {YouTubePlayerModule} from '@angular/youtube-player';\r\nimport { DOCUMENT } from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    YouTubePlayerModule,\r\n  ],\r\n  declarations: [YoutubePlayerExample],\r\n})\r\nexport class YoutubePlayerExampleModule {\r\n}\r\n\r\n// example-component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: '<youtube-player videoId=\"PRQCAL_RMVo\"></youtube-player>',\r\n  selector: 'youtube-player-example',\r\n})\r\nclass YoutubePlayerExample implements OnInit {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    @Inject(DOCUMENT) private document: Document,\r\n  ) { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    // This code loads the IFrame Player API code asynchronously, according to the instructions at\r\n    // https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Getting_Started\r\n    if (this.document && this.document.body && this.document.body.querySelector && !this.document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]') {\r\n      const tag = this.document.createElement('script');\r\n\r\n      tag.src = \"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\";\r\n      this.document.body.appendChild(tag);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could go on to encourage use of the ? existence check to simplify the if statement to \r\n```\r\nif (this.document?.body?.querySelector && !this.document.body.querySelector('script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]')\r\n```\r\nbut I felt that it was best to recommend a TypeScript version agnostic change (while still encouraging defensive checking).\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts/criticism/input is obviously more than welcome. I'm happy to make a PR for this if the proposed fix is viewed favourably/requested.

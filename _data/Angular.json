It has several flaws that make it an insufficient change detection mechanism:\r\n\r\n* It runs change detection for the component under test _after_ views attached to the `ApplicationRef`. This can cause real behavior differences that break in production, because tests can observe view refreshes in the incorrect order (for example, a dialog refreshing before the component which opened it).\r\n* Because of the above ordering, render hooks registered during change detection of the fixture views _will not execute at all_ because `ApplicationRef.tick` already happen.\r\n* It does not rerun change detection on the view tree if there are more dirty views to refresh after the render hooks complete.\r\n* It effectively hides/swallows errors from change detection inside the `onMicrotaskEmpty` subscription by not reporting them to the error handler. Instead, this error ends up being unhandled in the subscription and rxjs throws these in a `setTimeout`.\r\n\r\nAll of the above are problematic but this commit _does not_ fix the final point. Ideally, we can land this in a future change but this requires additional internal fixes. In the meantime, we have to juggle special-case handling of the component fixture views within `ApplicationRef.tick` using some special events to retain current behavior and avoid errors from the fixture propagating to the `ErrorHandler`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54354","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): ComponentFixture autodetect should detect changes within ApplicationRef.tick\" (#54354)"},{"Id":"2126049696","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T20:51:22","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"54353","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): do not crash for signal query that does not have any matches","State":"open","Body":"The newly introduced signal queries would error if no match exists, due to an invalid read within the query internals.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses the crash by allowing there to be no matches.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54353","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): do not crash for signal query that does not have any matches\" (#54353)"},{"Id":"2125592983","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T19:21:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"54344","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: reuse fake core in type checking tests","State":"closed","Body":"Currently we have two fake copies of `@angular/core` in the compiler tests which can be out of sync and cause inconsistent tests.

This is wasteful because we clear the dirty bit at the end of refreshing a view anyways so it really has no affect on that view.\r\n\r\nSometimes we can reach a view and refresh it when the parents have been skipped. For example, this happens with views that have updated signals. Ancestors are only traversed and not refreshed. Marking dirty all the way up to the root in this case can result in those ancestor views being marked with the dirty flag and it not being cleared.\r\n\r\nThis only became problematic when we started to support backwards referenced transplanted views and changed signal change detection to not mark ancestors for check. In addition to that, the loop in change detection support to remove `ExpressionChanged...` errors for these cases can potentially cause infinite loops in rare cases when these views are refreshed at a time when parents have only been traversed and `markForCheck` is called. Prior to the loop, if this `markForCheck` was combined with an actual change to binding values, this would cause `ExpressionChangedAfterItWasCheckedError`.\r\n\r\nFor regular cases where we are refreshing a view, update a binding, and call `markForCheck`, this is either `ExpressionChanged...` in views with default change detection or no error at all (but without any state update) in views that are `OnPush` since the `Dirty` flag is cleared at the end of `refreshView` and `checkNoChanges` uses the same `Dirty` bit for traversal (#45612).\r\n\r\nThe only case where this might cause different and unexpected behavior is if change detection starts in the middle of a view tree via `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges` _and_ a state update happens where the state is read in a view above the root of the traversal along with `markForCheck`. This might be the case for updating host bindings during change detection. That said, we have never really intented to support updating state during change detection, especially in a location above the current spot in the current view tree. This violates unidirectional data flow, a principle we have always intented to enforce outside of using signals for state.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54347","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(core): Avoid traversal when `markForCheck` is called on a view being refreshed\" (#54347)"},{"Id":"2125737732","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T18:01:53","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"54346","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"fix(compiler-cli): interpolatedSignalNotInvoked diagnostic for model signals (#54338)\"","State":"closed","Body":"Reverts #54338 from the patch branch since model inputs haven't been merged there.\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 63a9027720611002c6ee3b443a11e9feff213059.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54346","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"fix(compiler-cli): interpolatedSignalNotInvoked diagnostic for model signals (#54338)\"\" (#54346)"},{"Id":"2125631281","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T17:02:04","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"54345","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]","State":"closed","Body":"Updated Angular CLI help contents.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54345","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]\" (#54345)"},{"Id":"2124992852","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T16:49:17","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"54334","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: tidy up signal signal input/query/model signature tests","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

When a transplanted view is inserted before its declaration, it gets refreshed in the retry loop of `detectChanges`. At this point, the `Dirty` flag has been cleared from all parents. Calling `markForCheck` marks the insertion tree up to the root `Dirty`. If the declaration is checked again as a result (i.e. because it has default change detection) and is reachable because its parent was marked `Dirty`, this can cause an infinite loop. The declaration is refreshed again, so the insertion is marked for refresh (again). We enter an infinite loop if the insertion tree always calls `markForCheck` for some reason (i.e. `{{createReplayObservable() | async}}`).\r\n\r\nWhile the case above does fall into an infinite loop, it also truly is a problem in the application. While it's not an infinite synchronous loop, the declaration and insertion are infinitely dirty and will be refreshed on every change detection round.\r\n\r\nUsually `markForCheck` does not have this problem because the `Dirty` flag is not cleared until the very end of change detection. However, if the view did not already have the `Dirty` flag set, it is never cleared because we never entered view refresh. One solution to this problem could be to clear the `Dirty` flag even after skipping view refresh but traversing to children.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54329","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): Fix possible infinite loop with `markForCheck` by partially reverting #54074\" (#54329)"},{"Id":"2125381178","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T16:37:00","Actor":"Puigcerber","Number":"54341","RawContent":null,"Title":"Some styles rules are missing in the new angular.dev Style Guide","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nHi!

This option allows global identifiers present in the code to be replaced with another value at build time. This is similar to the behavior of Webpack's `DefinePlugin` which was previously used with some custom Webpack configurations that used third-party builders. The option has similar capabilities to the `esbuild` option of the same name. The documentation for that option can be found here: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define \r\nThe command line capabilities of the Angular CLI option are not yet implemented and will added in a future change.\r\n\r\nThe option within the `angular.json` configuration file is of the form of an object. The keys of the object represent the global identifier to replace and the values of the object represent the corresponding replacement value for the identifier. An example is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"define\": {\r\n    \"SOME_CONSTANT\": \"5\",\r\n    \"ANOTHER\": \"'this is a string literal'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll replacement values are defined as strings within the configuration file. If the replacement is intended to be an actual string literal, it should be enclosed in single quote marks. This allows the flexibility of using any valid JSON type as well as a different identifier as a replacement.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, TypeScript needs to be aware of the types to prevent type-checking\r\nerrors during the build. This can be accomplished with an additional type definition file within the\r\napplication source code (`src/types.d.ts`, for example) with the following or similar content:\r\n```\r\ndeclare const SOME_CONSTANT: number;\r\ndeclare const ANOTHER: string;\r\n```\r\nThe default project configuration is already setup to use any type definition files present in the\r\nproject source directories.

Performance & Core Web Vitals","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n@angular/core and @angular/cli\r\n\r\n### Problems :\r\n\r\n- Using custom fonts from **Google Fonts** can significantly impact FCP, LCP and initial load performance in Angular applications.\r\n\r\n- Downloading fonts from Google servers adds **extra HTTP requests** and **latency**, slowing down initial paint times.\r\n\r\n- The **font swapping** has the potential to cause layout shifts and so impact Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution :\r\n\r\n- Introduce a **built-in** **mechanism** in Angular to **automatically downloads fonts** specified by their Google Fonts names (or similar identifiers) during the build process and **self-host fonts** within the application, eliminating the need for external font services like Google Fonts.\r\n\r\n- Utilize **preconnect**, **preload**, and **size-adjust** for optimal performance and seamless font rendering.\r\n\r\n### Benefits :\r\n\r\n- **Improved Performance:** Reduces reliance on external requests, minimizes layout shifts (thanks to the underlying CSS size-adjust) , and enables efficient caching.\r\n\r\n- **Improved FCP and LCP:** Optimized fonts and proactive loading strategies contribute to significantly faster loading times and smoother user experiences.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced SEO:** Better Core Web Vitals can lead to higher search engine ranking and increased website traffic.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced Security:** Minimizes exposure to external vulnerabilities and provides more control over font sources.\r\n\r\n- **Developer Experience:** Built-in font optimization in Angular improves developer experience.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAnyone interested is welcome to comment on what the proposed syntax and feature set will be.\r\n\r\nInspired by next.js automatic font self-hosting library (

It seems now certain initialization methods are getting called before content children exist in some cases?\r\n\r\nPrior to this update it looks like `_cacheRowDefs()` was not called until `ngAfterContentChecked()` which meant all content children queries had values. In `17.1.10` however this call now has a chance to run in `_outletAssigned()`.\r\n\r\n`_outletAssigned()` checks for the existence of: \r\n- `this._rowOutlet`\r\n- `this._headerRowOutlet`\r\n- `this._footerRowOutlet`\r\n- `this._noDataRowOutlet`\r\n\r\nHowever, when `_cacheRowDefs()` is called here (as a result of `_render()` getting called), it uses these `ContentChild` queries:\r\n- `this._contentHeaderRowDefs`\r\n- `this._contentFooterRowDefs`\r\n- `this._contentRowDefs`\r\n\r\nHowever, these are all undefined still when run with `17.1.0` or higher at the moment (at least when run in our library's storybook). It seems they are maybe getting called too early because of `_outletAssigned()`? When run in `17.0.6` or any early version this was never the case because these methods only were called after `ngAfterContentChecked()`. The problem here is those empty values get passed to `_getOwnDefs()`, which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprivate _getOwnDefs<I extends {_table?: any}>(items: QueryList<I>): I[] {\r\n  return items.filter(item => !item._table || item._table === this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause this method assumes items exist, but they are actually undefined in this instance an error gets thrown and no tables can load.\r\n\r\nI assume because `_render()` looks like it still gets called in `ngAfterContentChecked()` everything would be fine as long as `_getOwnDefs()` and possibly other internal methods were updated to handle null/undefined scenarios.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI am unsure how to recreate this at the moment. I assume it only occurs on a more old-school non-standalone component example perhaps? I wanted to open this ticket as this will prevent us from allowing anyone to update to `17.1.0` or higher until we can get something figured out here.\r\n\r\nOur extension of the CDK table is purely for styling much like the MatTable and its directives. We do not alter any of this logic or override any lower CDK functions.\r\n\r\nI will work on recreating this in a stackblitz and update this ticket when/if I can.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTables load like normal.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')\r\n    at MtrTable._getOwnDefs (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_angular_cdk_17_1_2__angular_common_17_1_2__angular_core_17_1_2_rxjs-b8ea33.iframe.bundle.js:2405:18)\r\n    at MtrTable._cacheRowDefs (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_angular_cdk_17_1_2__angular_common_17_1_2__angular_core_17_1_2_rxjs-b8ea33.iframe.bundle.js:2142:49)\r\n    at MtrTable._render (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_angular_cdk_17_1_2__angular_common_17_1_2__angular_core_17_1_2_rxjs-b8ea33.iframe.bundle.js:2042:10)\r\n    at MtrTable._outletAssigned (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_angular_cdk_17_1_2__angular_common_17_1_2__angular_core_17_1_2_rxjs-b8ea33.iframe.bundle.js:2036:12)\r\n    at new FooterRowOutlet (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_angular_cdk_17_1_2__angular_common_17_1_2__angular_core_17_1_2_rxjs-b8ea33.iframe.bundle.js:1497:11)\r\n    at NodeInjectorFactory.FooterRowOutlet_Factory [as factory] (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_angular_cdk_17_1_2__angular_common_17_1_2__angular_core_17_1_2_rxjs-b8ea33.iframe.bundle.js:1500:12)\r\n    at getNodeInjectable (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_storybook_addon-essentials_7_6_9__types_react-dom_18_0_6__types_rea-3e3f13.iframe.bundle.js:56043:38)\r\n    at instantiateAllDirectives (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_storybook_addon-essentials_7_6_9__types_react-dom_18_0_6__types_rea-3e3f13.iframe.bundle.js:64249:23)\r\n    at createDirectivesInstances (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_storybook_addon-essentials_7_6_9__types_react-dom_18_0_6__types_rea-3e3f13.iframe.bundle.js:63671:3)\r\n    at ɵɵelementContainerStart (vendors-node_modules_pnpm_storybook_addon-essentials_7_6_9__types_react-dom_18_0_6__types_rea-3e3f13.iframe.bundle.js:73435:5)\r\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `>= 17.1.0`\r\n- CDK/Material: `>= 17.1.0`\r\n- Browser(s): Chromium, Webkit, and Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): MacOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28538","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(CdkTable): render QueryList timing issue in >= 17.1.0\" (#28538)"},{"Id":"2122643764","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T18:37:18","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28551","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/table): error if outlets are assigned too early","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the table was throwing an error if all outlets are assigned before `ngAfterContentInit`.\r\n\r\nFixes #28538.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28551","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/table): error if outlets are assigned too early\" (#28551)"},{"Id":"2125576648","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T16:18:08","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"28561","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material-experimental/theming): Add more tests for M3 theme tokens","State":"open","Body":"Additional tests that help ensure our M3 theme conforms to the following rules:\r\n- Does not add any additional selector specificity\r\n- Emits only CSS variable definitions\r\n- Emits each token for one and only one theme dimension\r\n\r\nAlso fixes several existing bugs that were discovered by the new tests.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28561","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material-experimental/theming): Add more tests for M3 theme tokens\" (#28561)"},{"Id":"2120396201","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T13:37:06","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28541","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/menu): prevent icon from collapsing when text is long","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the icon the menu item was collapsing if the menu item text was too long.\r\n\r\nFixes #28502.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28541","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/menu): prevent icon from collapsing when text is long\" (#28541)"},{"Id":"2124721372","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-08T09:36:45","Actor":"aapjaapan","Number":"28560","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(MatSnackBar): Pause dismiss when hovering snackbar","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nWhen snackbar has some info that needs more time to process, would be nice that when hovering the snackbar it would not close despite the duration\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28560","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatSnackBar): Pause dismiss when hovering snackbar\" (#28560)"},{"Id":"2123530395","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-07T23:09:17","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"28555","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: Ensure M3 theme is well behaved","State":"closed","Body":"Specifically it should:\r\n1.

This is because HTTP errors from backend endpoints may cause missing data to be displayed in the final HTML output, and runtime errors in a component's logic may cause the HTML to be rendered incorrectly.\r\n\r\nWhen ExpressJS receives a request from a client, it calls the `ngExpressEngine` from the public API of `@nguniversal/express-engine` that under the hood uses the method [`renderModule()`](https://angular.io/api/platform-server/renderModule) from `@angular/platform-server` to render an app and obtain the final HTML output. This last function returns a `Promise` that either resolves to the final HTML string output or rejects with the error payload. As of Angular 15, this Promise is rejected only in 2 cases:\r\n- when an error happens in some of Angular `APP_INITIALIZER` hooks\r\n- during the synchronous bootstrap of the root component.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the Angular's function `renderModule()` doesn't allow for rejecting the `Promise` in any other case, e.g. when an error happens in some other asynchronous task during the rendering (e.g. in a child component that is rendered after a delay, or after making some http calls to a backend). For reference, you might check the Angular v15.2 implementation of the [function \"renderModule()\"](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/16.1.x/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts#L140-L150) and it's dependency [function \"_render()\"](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/15.2.x/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts#L48-L111).\r\n\r\nI believe this problem is important for all users of the Angular rendering on the server. I think Angular by default should a safety mechanism to prevent SEO degradation when some async error happens during the rendering (e.g. when a backend API is temporarily unavailable or when a runtime error occurs in the application).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI can see 2 possible solutions:\r\na) the Promise should be rejected immediately, whenever an error reaches `ErrorHandler`\r\nb) the Promise should be rejected only when the app is stable, after an error reaches `ErrorHandler`\r\n\r\nNote: You might want to recover from some errors successfully in your custom `ErrorHandler`, to only errors re-thrown from `ErrorHandler` should be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAs a workaround for now, we can build a custom mechanism of propagating errors directly from Angular's ErrorHandler to the ExpressJS server (e.g. via a custom callback provided into Angular's Dependency Injection) and then ignore the result of `renderModule()` (and `ngExpressEngine`). Example draft implementation below:\r\n\r\nAngular app - define injection token `PROPAGATE_ERROR_TO_CLIENT`, and use it in custom `ErrorHandler`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { ErrorHandler } from `@angular/core`;\r\n\r\nexport const PROPAGATE_ERROR_TO_CLIENT = new InjectionToken<(error:unknown)=>void>('PROPAGATE_ERROR_TO_CLIENT');\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class CustomErrorHandler extends ErrorHandler {\r\n   propagateErrorToClient = inject(PROPAGATE_ERROR_TO_CLIENT);\r\n   handleError(error){\r\n      this.propagateErrorToClient(error)\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpress app - provide a concrete function for injection token `PROPAGATE_ERROR_TO_CLIENT` that send the given error to a client. \r\n```ts\r\nimport { format } from 'node:util';\r\n\r\nserver.get('*', (req, res) => {\r\n  function propagateErrorToClient(error) {\r\n    res.status(500).send(format(error));\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  res.render(indexHtml, {\r\n    req,\r\n    providers: [{ provide: PROPAGATE_ERROR_TO_CLIENT, useValue: propagateErrorToClient }],\r\n    (err,html) => {\r\n      if(res.headersSent) { return; } // avoid sending response, if we already did it (e.g. if `propagateErrorToClient()` was invoked before)\r\n      if(err) { res.status(500).send(format(err)); return; }\r\n      res.status(200).send(html);\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- it works :D \r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- it tightly couples the ExpressJS app with the internals of Angular app via a new injection token `PROPAGATE_ERROR_TO_CLIENT`\r\n- when error is propagated to a client, the app is yet not stable and rendering not finished. Eventually when the rendering is finished, we have to explicitly ignore the result of the rendering, if a response has been already sent to a client (because `propagateErrorToClient` was called before).\r\n- we work around the standard API of Express rendering engine (`ngExpressEngine` and `renderModule` from Angular), which returns possible 2 types of results: HTML or error, when the rendering is finished.\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere's another custom alternative approach that @eneajaho took in his library `ngx-isr` (btw. kudos to Enea for your work ðŸ™Œ ) took a different approach:\r\n- [intercept all http errors](https://github.com/eneajaho/ngx-isr/blob/main/projects/ngx-isr/server/src/http-errors.interceptor.ts#L20-L22) and [collect them to an array](https://github.com/eneajaho/ngx-isr/blob/main/projects/ngx-isr/server/src/ngx-isr-server.service.ts#L66-L68). Note: `ngx-isr` doesn't collect other asynchronous errors. But this could be easily added by providing a custom `ErrorHandler`.\r\n- [in the hook BEFORE_APP_SERIALIZED](https://github.com/eneajaho/ngx-isr/blob/main/projects/ngx-isr/server/src/ngx-isr.module.ts#L37-L38), the [errors are embedded into the final HTML as a `<script>` with JSON](https://github.com/eneajaho/ngx-isr/blob/main/projects/ngx-isr/server/src/utils/add-isr-data-before-serialized.ts#L11-L29) - similar technique to the Angular's \"TrasferState\" (but here it's used to transfer data not to the client, but to the server middleware) \r\n- then in the server middleware, [the final HTML is parsed so to extract possible `errors` from the `<script>` appended in the end of the html body](https://github.com/eneajaho/ngx-isr/blob/main/projects/ngx-isr/server/src/utils/get-isr-options.ts#L11-L33) and [if it contains embedded errors, the final HTML is ignored](https://github.com/eneajaho/ngx-isr/blob/main/projects/ngx-isr/server/src/cache-regeneration.ts#L39-L49) \r\n\r\nObservation: this approach waits until the app is stable (no async tasks).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50829","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Propagate asynchronous errors during server-side rendering to a client\" (#50829)"},{"Id":"1770465213","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-23T16:37:18","Actor":"MaciejWWojcik","Number":"50822","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: invert logic for disabled in getting started docs","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[`v0.18.7`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0187)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.6...v0.18.7)\n\n-   Add support for `using` declarations in TypeScript 5.2+ ([#&#8203;3191](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3191))\n\n    TypeScript 5.2 (due to be released in August of 2023) will introduce `using` declarations, which will allow you to automatically dispose of the declared resources when leaving the current scope. You can read the [TypeScript PR for this feature](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/54505) for more information. This release of esbuild adds support for transforming this syntax to target environments without support for `using` declarations (which is currently all targets other than `esnext`). Here's an example (helper functions are omitted):\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      [Symbol.dispose]() {\n        console.log('cleanup')\n      }\n    }\n    using foo = new Foo;\n    foo.bar();\n\n    // New output (with --target=es6)\n    var _stack = [];\n    try {\n      var Foo = class {\n        [Symbol.dispose]() {\n          console.log(\"cleanup\");\n        }\n      };\n      var foo = __using(_stack, new Foo());\n      foo.bar();\n    } catch (_) {\n      var _error = _, _hasError = true;\n    } finally {\n      __callDispose(_stack, _error, _hasError);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The injected helper functions ensure that the method named `Symbol.dispose` is called on `new Foo` when control exits the scope. Note that as with all new JavaScript APIs, you'll need to polyfill `Symbol.dispose` if it's not present before you use it. This is not something that esbuild does for you because esbuild only handles syntax, not APIs. Polyfilling it can be done with something like this:\n\n    ```js\n    Symbol.dispose ||= Symbol('Symbol.dispose')\n    ```\n\n    This feature also introduces `await using` declarations which are like `using` declarations but they call `await` on the disposal method (not on the initializer). Here's an example (helper functions are omitted):\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {\n        await new Promise(done => {\n          setTimeout(done, 1000)\n        })\n        console.log('cleanup')\n      }\n    }\n    await using foo = new Foo;\n    foo.bar();\n\n    // New output (with --target=es2022)\n    var _stack = [];\n    try {\n      var Foo = class {\n        async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {\n          await new Promise((done) => {\n            setTimeout(done, 1e3);\n          });\n          console.log(\"cleanup\");\n        }\n      };\n      var foo = __using(_stack, new Foo(), true);\n      foo.bar();\n    } catch (_) {\n      var _error = _, _hasError = true;\n    } finally {\n      var _promise = __callDispose(_stack, _error, _hasError);\n      _promise && await _promise;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The injected helper functions ensure that the method named `Symbol.asyncDispose` is called on `new Foo` when control exits the scope, and that the returned promise is awaited. Similarly to `Symbol.dispose`, you'll also need to polyfill `Symbol.asyncDispose` before you use it.\n\n-   Add a `--line-limit=` flag to limit line length ([#&#8203;3170](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3170))\n\n    Long lines are common in minified code. However, many tools and text editors can't handle long lines. This release introduces the `--line-limit=` flag to tell esbuild to wrap lines longer than the provided number of bytes. For example, `--line-limit=80` tells esbuild to insert a newline soon after a given line reaches 80 bytes in length. This setting applies to both JavaScript and CSS, and works even when minification is disabled. Note that turning this setting on will make your files bigger, as the extra newlines take up additional space in the file (even after gzip compression).\n\n### [`v0.18.6`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0186)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.5...v0.18.6)\n\n-   Fix tree-shaking of classes with decorators ([#&#8203;3164](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3164))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild incorrectly allowed tree-shaking on classes with decorators. Each decorator is a function call, so classes with decorators must never be tree-shaken. This bug was a regression that was unintentionally introduced in version 0.18.2 by the change that enabled tree-shaking of lowered private fields. Previously decorators were always lowered, and esbuild always considered the automatically-generated decorator code to be a side effect. But this is no longer the case now that esbuild analyzes side effects using the AST before lowering takes place. This bug was fixed by considering any decorator a side effect.\n\n-   Fix a minification bug involving function expressions ([#&#8203;3125](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3125))\n\n    When minification is enabled, esbuild does limited inlining of `const` symbols at the top of a scope. This release fixes a bug where inlineable symbols were incorrectly removed assuming that they were inlined. They may not be inlined in cases where they were referenced by earlier constants in the body of a function expression. The declarations involved in these edge cases are now kept instead of being removed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    {\n      const fn = () => foo\n      const foo = 123\n      console.log(fn)\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify-syntax)\n    console.log((() => foo)());\n\n    // New output (with --minify-syntax)\n    {\n      const fn = () => foo, foo = 123;\n      console.log(fn);\n    }\n    ```\n\n### [`v0.18.5`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0185)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.4...v0.18.5)\n\n-   Implement auto accessors ([#&#8203;3009](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3009))\n\n    This release implements the new auto-accessor syntax from the upcoming [JavaScript decorators proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-decorators). The auto-accessor syntax looks like this:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      accessor foo;\n      static accessor bar;\n    }\n    new Foo().foo = Foo.bar;\n    ```\n\n    This syntax is not yet a part of JavaScript but it was [added to TypeScript in version 4.9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/#auto-accessors-in-classes). More information about this feature can be found in [microsoft/TypeScript#&#8203;49705](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/49705). Auto-accessors will be transformed if the target is set to something other than `esnext`:\n\n    ```js\n    // Output (with --target=esnext)\n    class Foo {\n      accessor foo;\n      static accessor bar;\n    }\n    new Foo().foo = Foo.bar;\n\n    // Output (with --target=es2022)\n    class Foo {\n      #foo;\n      get foo() {\n        return this.#foo;\n      }\n      set foo(_) {\n        this.#foo = _;\n      }\n      static #bar;\n      static get bar() {\n        return this.#bar;\n      }\n      static set bar(_) {\n        this.#bar = _;\n      }\n    }\n    new Foo().foo = Foo.bar;\n\n    // Output (with --target=es2021)\n    var _foo, _bar;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _foo, void 0);\n      }\n      get foo() {\n        return __privateGet(this, _foo);\n      }\n      set foo(_) {\n        __privateSet(this, _foo, _);\n      }\n      static get bar() {\n        return __privateGet(this, _bar);\n      }\n      static set bar(_) {\n        __privateSet(this, _bar, _);\n      }\n    }\n    _foo = new WeakMap();\n    _bar = new WeakMap();\n    __privateAdd(Foo, _bar, void 0);\n    new Foo().foo = Foo.bar;\n    ```\n\n    You can also now use auto-accessors with esbuild's TypeScript experimental decorator transformation, which should behave the same as decorating the underlying getter/setter pair.\n\n    **Please keep in mind that this syntax is not yet part of JavaScript.** This release enables auto-accessors in `.js` files with the expectation that it will be a part of JavaScript soon. However, esbuild may change or remove this feature in the future if JavaScript ends up changing or removing this feature. Use this feature with caution for now.\n\n-   Pass through JavaScript decorators ([#&#8203;104](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/104))\n\n    In this release, esbuild now parses decorators from the upcoming [JavaScript decorators proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) and passes them through to the output unmodified (as long as the language target is set to `esnext`). Transforming JavaScript decorators to environments that don't support them has not been implemented yet. The only decorator transform that esbuild currently implements is still the TypeScript experimental decorator transform, which only works in `.ts` files and which requires `\"experimentalDecorators\": true` in your `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n-   Static fields with assign semantics now use static blocks if possible\n\n    Setting `useDefineForClassFields` to false in TypeScript requires rewriting class fields to assignment statements. Previously this was done by removing the field from the class body and adding an assignment statement after the class declaration. However, this also caused any private fields to also be lowered by necessity (in case a field initializer uses a private symbol, either directly or indirectly). This release changes this transform to use an inline static block if it's supported, which avoids needing to lower private fields in this scenario:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Test {\n      static #foo = 123\n      static bar = this.#foo\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with useDefineForClassFields=false)\n    var _foo;\n    const _Test = class _Test {\n    };\n    _foo = new WeakMap();\n    __privateAdd(_Test, _foo, 123);\n    _Test.bar = __privateGet(_Test, _foo);\n    let Test = _Test;\n\n    // New output (with useDefineForClassFields=false)\n    class Test {\n      static #foo = 123;\n      static {\n        this.bar = this.#foo;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix TypeScript experimental decorators combined with `--mangle-props` ([#&#8203;3177](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3177))\n\n    Previously using TypeScript experimental decorators combined with the `--mangle-props` setting could result in a crash, as the experimental decorator transform was not expecting a mangled property as a class member. This release fixes the crash so you can now combine both of these features together safely.\n\n### [`v0.18.4`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0184)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.18.3...v0.18.4)\n\n-   Bundling no longer unnecessarily transforms class syntax ([#&#8203;1360](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1360), [#&#8203;1328](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1328), [#&#8203;1524](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1524), [#&#8203;2416](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2416))\n\n    When bundling, esbuild automatically converts top-level class statements to class expressions. Previously this conversion had the unfortunate side-effect of also transforming certain other class-related syntax features to avoid correctness issues when the references to the class name within the class body. This conversion has been reworked to avoid doing this:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    export class Foo {\n      static foo = () => Foo\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle)\n    var _Foo = class {\n    };\n    var Foo = _Foo;\n    __publicField(Foo, \"foo\", () => _Foo);\n\n    // New output (with --bundle)\n    var Foo = class _Foo {\n      static foo = () => _Foo;\n    };\n    ```\n\n    This conversion process is very complicated and has many edge cases (including interactions with static fields, static blocks, private class properties, and TypeScript experimental decorators). It should already be pretty robust but a change like this may introduce new unintentional behavior. Please report any issues with this upgrade on the esbuild bug tracker.\n\n    You may be wondering why esbuild needs to do this at all. One reason to do this is that esbuild's bundler sometimes needs to lazily-evaluate a module. For example, a module may end up being both the target of a dynamic `import()` call and a static `import` statement. Lazy module evaluation is done by wrapping the top-level module code in a closure. To avoid a performance hit for static `import` statements, esbuild stores top-level exported symbols outside of the closure and references them directly instead of indirectly.\n\n    Another reason to do this is that multiple JavaScript VMs have had and continue to have performance issues with TDZ (i.e. \"temporal dead zone\") checks. These checks validate that a let, or const, or class symbol isn't used before it's initialized. Here are two issues with well-known VMs:\n\n    -   V8: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=13723 (10% slowdown)\n    -   JavaScriptCore: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199866 (1,000% slowdown!)\n\n    JavaScriptCore had a severe performance issue as their TDZ implementation had time complexity that was quadratic in the number of variables needing TDZ checks in the same scope (with the top-level scope typically being the worst offender). V8 has ongoing issues with TDZ checks being present throughout the code their JIT generates even when they have already been checked earlier in the same function or when the function in question has already been run (so the checks have already happened).\n\n    Due to esbuild's parallel architecture, esbuild both a) needs to convert class statements into class expressions during parsing and b) doesn't yet know whether this module will need to be lazily-evaluated or not in the parser. So esbuild always does this conversion during bundling in case it's needed for correctness (and also to avoid potentially catastrophic performance issues due to bundling creating a large scope with many TDZ variables).\n\n-   Enforce TDZ errors in computed class property keys ([#&#8203;2045](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2045))\n\n    JavaScript allows class property keys to be generated at run-time using code, like this:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      static foo = 'foo'\n      static [Foo.foo + '2'] = 2\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild treated references to the containing class name within computed property keys as a reference to the partially-initialized class object. That meant code that attempted to reference properties of the class object (such as the code above) would get back `undefined` instead of throwing an error.\n\n    This release rewrites references to the containing class name within computed property keys into code that always throws an error at run-time, which is how this JavaScript code is supposed to work. Code that does this will now also generate a warning. You should never write code like this, but it now should be more obvious when incorrect code like this is written.\n\n-   Fix an issue with experimental decorators and static fields ([#&#8203;2629](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2629))\n\n    This release also fixes a bug regarding TypeScript experimental decorators and static class fields which reference the enclosing class name in their initializer. This affected top-level classes when bundling was enabled. Previously code that does this could crash because the class name wasn't initialized yet. This case should now be handled correctly:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;someDecorator\n      static foo = 'foo'\n      static bar = Foo.foo.length\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    const _Foo = class {\n      static foo = \"foo\";\n      static bar = _Foo.foo.length;\n    };\n    let Foo = _Foo;\n    __decorateClass([\n      someDecorator\n    ], Foo, \"foo\", 2);\n\n    // New output\n    const _Foo = class _Foo {\n      static foo = \"foo\";\n      static bar = _Foo.foo.length;\n    };\n    __decorateClass([\n      someDecorator\n    ], _Foo, \"foo\", 2);\n    let Foo = _Foo;\n    ```\n\n-   Fix a minification regression with negative numeric properties ([#&#8203;3169](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3169))\n\n    Version 0.18.0 introduced a regression where computed properties with negative numbers were incorrectly shortened into a non-computed property when minification was enabled. This regression has been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    x = {\n      [1]: 1,\n      [-1]: -1,\n      [NaN]: NaN,\n      [Infinity]: Infinity,\n      [-Infinity]: -Infinity,\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    x={1:1,-1:-1,NaN:NaN,1/0:1/0,-1/0:-1/0};\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    x={1:1,[-1]:-1,NaN:NaN,[1/0]:1/0,[-1/0]:-1/0};\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.43.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.43.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.42.0...v8.43.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`14581ff`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/14581ff15aaee5a55c46bbf4983818ddc8dd7cb1) feat: directive prologue detection and autofix condition in `quotes` ([#&#8203;17284](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17284)) (Francesco Trotta)\n-   [`e50fac3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/e50fac3f8f998f729e3080e256066db3a7827c67) feat: add declaration loc to message in block-scoped-var ([#&#8203;17252](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17252)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`1b7faf0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/1b7faf0702b1af86b6a0ddafc37cf45d60f5d4d8) feat: add `skipJSXText` option to `no-irregular-whitespace` rule ([#&#8203;17182](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17182)) (Azat S)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`5338b56`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/5338b56fda7f47d16bdb23514f1e95b24de7b92f) fix: normalize `cwd` passed to `ESLint`/`FlatESLint` constructor ([#&#8203;17277](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17277)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`54383e6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/54383e69b092ef537d59a1f7799a85b1412f4e59) fix: Remove `no-extra-parens` autofix for potential directives ([#&#8203;17022](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17022)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`8b855ea`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/8b855ea058992d5446d1d6dc6394ee683c3200a0) docs: resubmit pr17061 doc changes ([#&#8203;17292](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17292)) (å”¯ç„¶)\n-   [`372722e`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/372722eac32ca9e3f31cf0d0bc10317c6f153369) docs: resubmit pr17012 doc changes ([#&#8203;17293](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17293)) (å”¯ç„¶)\n-   [`67e7af3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/67e7af3fdbdb4648b747dfd669be4decfe24086a) docs: resubmit custom-rules doc changes ([#&#8203;17294](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17294)) (å”¯ç„¶)\n-   [`9e3d77c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/9e3d77cba65d0e38e07996e57961fb04f30d9303) docs: Resubmit Fix formatting in Custom Rules docs ([#&#8203;17281](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17281)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`503647a`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/503647a0b94ca8c776d7e7e8c54c8b1d32904467) docs: Resubmit markVariableAsUsed docs ([#&#8203;17280](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17280)) (Nicholas C.

Of course, the only change I made to the libraries was to update the version of Angular we use. We first noticed the issue when our CI/CD pipelines started failing on new merge requests but the main branch was still succeeding. If there is a version of the library built/cached in the `dist` folder the build does succeed, I am assuming this has something to do with how things are cached. Builds only seem to fail when they are done cold/with nothing in the cache.\r\n\r\nLooking through our build logs the issue seems to have been introduced around `ng-packagr v16.1.0`. No changes have been made to the failing library for a couple of weeks now code-wise.\r\n\r\nI will attach the error message below.

The other bug was locked, so I wasn't able to reply there.  It seemed the suggestion from @alan-agius4 was to install `@angular-devkit/core` in order to ensure you have the right version, but we're already doing that, and it's still presenting.  This all worked well in 16.0.3.  Looking at my `yarn.lock` there's only the one version of `@angular-devkit/core` installed.  Additionally, using any of the functions from `@angular/cdk/schematics` fail with a similar error.\r\n\r\nEdit: based on @alan-agius4's comments below, it seems this is caused by `@angular/cdk` using deep imports in the schematics code, which is no longer allowed.  This tracks with my findings, as cdk 16.1.1 will work if I rollback the cli libraries to 16.0.3.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n`ng generate @angular/material:mdc-migration`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nMigration completes successfully\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen running the migration from the cli\r\n```bash\r\nError: Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/core/src/workspace/json/reader' from '../../node_modules/@angular/cdk/schematics/utils/project-tsconfig-paths.js'\r\n\r\nRequire stack:\r\n  D:/src/fabric/node_modules/@angular/cdk/schematics/utils/project-tsconfig-paths.js\r\n  D:/src/fabric/node_modules/@angular/cdk/schematics/utils/index.js\r\n  D:/src/fabric/node_modules/@angular/cdk/schematics/index.js\r\n  D:/src/fabric/node_modules/@angular/material/schematics/ng-generate/mdc-migration/index_bundled.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using any functions from `@angular/cdk/schematics`\r\n```bash\r\n Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/core/src/workspace/json/reader' from '../../node_modules/@angular/cdk/schematics/utils/project-tsconfig-paths.js'\r\n\r\n    Require stack:\r\n      D:/src/fabric/node_modules/@angular/cdk/schematics/utils/project-tsconfig-paths.js\r\n      D:/src/fabric/node_modules/@angular/cdk/schematics/utils/index.js\r\n      D:/src/fabric/node_modules/@angular/cdk/schematics/index.js\r\n      schematics/ng-add/index.spec.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16.0.3\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.1.1\r\n- Angular CLI: 16.1.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27344","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/schematics): Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/core/src/workspace/json/reader'\" (#27344)"},{"Id":"1768987330","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-22T10:59:24","Actor":"aanchal88","Number":"27342","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove unused methods from card component","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27342","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: remove unused methods from card component\" (#27342)"},{"Id":"1766996067","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-21T14:26:31","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27338","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/stepper): allow child animations to run","State":"closed","Body":"Currently the stepper doesn't explicitly allow child animations to run which means that other componets like expansion panels may be blocked from animating their initial state.\r\n\r\nThese changes add an `animateChild` query to the stepper to unblock the child animations.\r\n\r\nFixes #27318.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27338","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/stepper): allow child animations to run\" (#27338)"},{"Id":"1767714598","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-21T14:18:05","Actor":"quoctintran","Number":"27341","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/date-range-picker): placeholders for start and end show 'undefined'","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello\r\n\r\nIf the placeholder of the start or the end of the date range picker is undefined, the control shows 'undefined' for the placeholder.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/22502986/91b69bde-2c29-4ac2-9fb6-0079625e322a)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/mrm9eu-q3oknm?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdate-range-picker-forms-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

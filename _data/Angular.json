This is unexpected as esbuild's sole raison d'être is to be fast ;)\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the first incremental rebuild is slower than subsequent rebuilds, so for all tests we tigger the incremental build multiple times until times stabilize.\r\n\r\nOur app has >1000 components in >100 libraries. For testing, I just `touch` a typescript file in a feature library. So very few files should have to be recompiled & rebundled. With esbuild I get 11 sec for incremental builds, with webpack 9 seconds. \r\n\r\nLooking at running processes I see esbuild pegging most CPU cores at 100% for most of the time during the incremental rebuild. This seems to be corroborated by enabling `NG_BUILD_DEBUG_PERF`, which only logs negligible times:\r\n```\r\n$ NG_BUILD_DEBUG_PERF=1 ng build\r\n⠋ Changes detected.

Unfortunately there is no official profiling support, but it seems there is a lot of filesystem churn. When attaching strace to the running esbuild server (pid 698557 here), I get a surprising number of stat calls. For starters:\r\n```\r\nstrace -f -p 698557 |& grep /home/vbraun/frontend/package.json\r\n[pid 698634] newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, \"/home/vbraun/frontend/package.json\",  <unfinished ...>\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\ngives 71083 `stat()` calls to the `package.json` file from the different PIDs of esbuild's thread pool, each time an incremental build is triggered. Stat should run in a few microseconds but that alone probably adds up to more than 0.1s. \r\n\r\nThis is how far I have gotten debugging this..\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis is a private repo but others have reported the same: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25130#issuecomment-1684157200\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ npx ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.3\r\nNode: 16.18.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.5\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.3\r\n@angular/material               16.2.5\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.6\r\nng-packagr                      16.2.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n* Fedora 38 x86_64, btrfs\r\n* Ryzen 7900X 12-Core Processor, 64 GB RAM, nvme SSD\r\n* Using `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192` to avoid memory bottlenecks","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25935","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ESbuild slower incremental rebuilds\" (#25935)"},{"Id":"1921004983","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-01T22:24:33","Actor":"twoco","Number":"25931","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow CJS dependencies by wildcard.","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\nNot sure where to find docs sources.

It is being called from [`_isInRange`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L342) where `value` is compared to `startValue` and `endValue` which are calculated in [`_setRanges`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/1dc30e8eacae1f318b53a9d22a462571b9de8ddb/src/material/datepicker/month-view.ts#L599-L600) using [`_getCellCompareValue`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/1dc30e8eacae1f318b53a9d22a462571b9de8ddb/src/material/datepicker/month-view.ts#L578) which returns a number derived from `Date` derived from the original generic date object. `value` though is not a number like the typing might suggest, but a generic date object [retrieved from `MatCalendarCell.rawValue`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L515).\r\n\r\nThe correct way to compare these values would be to derive **all** 3 `startValue`, `endValue` and `value` using `_getCellCompareValue`, luckily the `MatCalendarCell` already contains such a derived value: [`compareValue`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L47), which is being [derived using `_getCellCompareValue`]()\r\n\r\n#### Why is this a problem and why isn't it a problem for most?\r\nNormally when using `Date` as your generic date object of choice, the [`isInRange`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/bdef0c399ae37a64cf6cb204fdb273b5e619daf5/src/material/datepicker/calendar-body.ts#L617) function implicitly calls the `valueOf()` function from `Date`, which happens to be equivalent to the logic in [`_getCellCompareValue`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/1dc30e8eacae1f318b53a9d22a462571b9de8ddb/src/material/datepicker/month-view.ts#L578).\r\n\r\nBut we are using the Picker with `Temporal.PlainDate` (using a polyfill), which [explicitly forbids](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plaindate.html#valueOf) calling the `valueOf()` function and the logic breaks down. This change should not result in any visible change for anyone using generic date objects that already do the conversion to unix timestamp implicitly, just that it's done explicitly now, but it will fix compatibility with other choices that don't do this.\r\n\r\nAlso on another note: The current way this is implemented violates TypeScript constraints, because it passes a `Date` or other date type to a function which only accepts a `number`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27896","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): Fixed raw date value being compared\" (#27896)"},{"Id":"1926259097","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-04T13:46:52","Actor":"shammy8","Number":"27895","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(menu): Disabled mat-menu-item on anchor tag still clickable","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA disabled mat-menu-item anchor  ie`<a disabled mat-menu-item (click)=\"stillGetsCalled()\" routerLink=\"/stillNavigates\"> Anchor</a>` looks disabled but is still clickable.\r\n\r\nHowever a regular href `<a disabled mat-menu-item href=\"https://www.google.com\"> Google</a>` works as expected\r\n\r\nThis occurs with the cdk menu item too. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/32sike?file=src%2Fexample%2Fmenu-icons-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

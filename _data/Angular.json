Answered yes.\r\nThe result in the terminal was something like: `source<(ng completion script)`\r\n\r\nThe completion did not work OOTB or even in a new terminal tab, decided to restart.\r\nAfter the restart saw this in the reopened terminal:\r\n\r\n![image 2022-05-14 20-11-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/681956/168443630-ee457e91-ba08-4d4d-97c6-c1802ffab50c.png)\r\n\r\nThen I realized the embedded terminal in WebStorm might have not been elevated so I repeated the entire `ng new` process from macOS Terminal. Unfortunately, I couldn't force the completion prompt to appear again. Now `ng new` proceeds now straight to the routing question.

After that I got error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported. After searching on the internet for a solution I found that this error occurs with node 17+. To solve the problem I was advised either to roll back to a previous version of node.js, or to add --openssl-legacy-provider flag. I found that my version of node.js is 16.14.0. I tried to write the flag with the NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider environment variable, to which I received a complaint that such a flag is not allowed. Then I wrote the following command: ng servce --openssl-legacy-provider, to which I got the same complaint.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n```bash\r\nng new hello_angular\r\ncd hello_angular\r\nng serve\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/t3m8ch/angular-error\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n~/T/n/hello_angular ❯❯❯ ng serve                                                                                                                                       master\r\n✔ Browser application bundle generation complete.\r\n\r\nInitial Chunk Files   | Names         |  Raw Size\r\nvendor.js             | vendor        |   1.37 MB | \r\npolyfills.js          | polyfills     | 294.80 kB | \r\nstyles.css, styles.js | styles        | 173.69 kB | \r\nmain.js               | main          |  48.20 kB | \r\nruntime.js            | runtime       |   6.52 kB | \r\n\r\n                      | Initial Total |   1.88 MB\r\n\r\nBuild at: 2022-05-14T10:07:17.769Z -

These annotations are passed through into the output by esbuild since many JavaScript tools understand them. However, there was an edge case where printing this comment before a function call caused esbuild to fail to parenthesize a function literal because it thought it was no longer at the start of the expression. This problem has been fixed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ (function() {\n    })()\n\n    // Old output\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ function() {\n    }();\n\n    // New output\n    export default /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ (function() {\n    })();\n    ```\n\n-   Preserve `...` before JSX child expressions ([#&#8203;2245](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2245))\n\n    TypeScript 4.5 changed how JSX child expressions that start with `...` are emitted. Previously the `...` was omitted but starting with TypeScript 4.5, the `...` is now preserved instead. This release updates esbuild to match TypeScript's new output in this case:\n\n    ```jsx\n    // Original code\n    console.log(<a>{...b}</a>)\n\n    // Old output\n    console.log(/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ React.createElement(\"a\", null, b));\n\n    // New output\n    console.log(/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ React.createElement(\"a\", null, ...b));\n    ```\n\n    Note that this behavior is TypeScript-specific. Babel doesn't support the `...` token at all (it gives the error \"Spread children are not supported in React\").\n\n-   Slightly adjust esbuild's handling of the `browser` field in `package.json` ([#&#8203;2239](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2239))\n\n    This release changes esbuild's interpretation of `browser` path remapping to fix a regression that was introduced in esbuild version 0.14.21. Browserify has a bug where it incorrectly matches package paths to relative paths in the `browser` field, and esbuild replicates this bug for compatibility with Browserify. I have a set of tests that I use to verify that esbuild's replication of this Browserify is accurate here: https://github.com/evanw/package-json-browser-tests. However, I was missing a test case and esbuild's behavior diverges from Browserify in this case. This release now handles this edge case as well:\n\n    -   `entry.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        require('pkg/sub')\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/package.json`:\n\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"browser\": {\n            \"./sub\": \"./sub/foo.js\",\n            \"./sub/sub.js\": \"./sub/foo.js\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/pkg/sub/foo.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        require('sub')\n        ```\n\n    -   `node_modules/sub/index.js`:\n\n        ```js\n        console.log('works')\n        ```\n\n    The import path `sub` in `require('sub')` was previously matching the remapping `\"./sub/sub.js\": \"./sub/foo.js\"` but with this release it should now no longer match that remapping. Now `require('sub')` will only match the remapping `\"./sub/sub\": \"./sub/foo.js\"` (without the trailing `.js`). Browserify apparently only matches without the `.js` suffix here.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.2`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0262-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0261v0262-2022-05-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.26.1...v0.26.2)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   specify types in exports ([#&#8203;214](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/214)) ([985e7b4](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/985e7b4d8a6fd5911d2ad2e6524999e9198a6b9f))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>ng-packagr/ng-packagr</summary>\n\n### [`v14.0.0-rc.0`](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-rc0-httpsgithubcomng-packagrng-packagrcomparev1400-next10v1400-rc0-2022-05-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/compare/v14.0.0-next.10...v14.0.0-rc.0)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>yargs/yargs</summary>\n\n### [`v17.5.0`](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1750-httpsgithubcomyargsyargscomparev1741v1750-2022-05-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/compare/v17.4.1...v17.5.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add browser.d.ts and check for existence of Error.captureStackTrace() ([#&#8203;2144](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2144)) ([6192990](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/6192990509cf793c4b10b88884d626893dee89df))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **completion:** support for default flags ([db35423](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/db354232705623bbcd8fad362f6a4d6d59650be5))\n-   import yargs/yargs in esm projects ([#&#8203;2151](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2151)) ([95aed1c](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/95aed1c175ec82e585003883bda1b6b75d5493ce))\n\n##### [17.4.1](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/compare/v17.4.0...v17.4.1) (2022-04-09)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   coerce pollutes argv ([#&#8203;2161](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2161)) ([2d1136d](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/2d1136d303ea805685a973ded62f52efd49b78b9))\n-   **completion:** don't show positional args choices with option choices ([#&#8203;2148](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2148)) ([b58b5bc](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/b58b5bc2cda7fc15acf559ae4a6a0eda0be06044))\n-   hide hidden options from completion ([#&#8203;2143](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2143)) ([e086dfa](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/e086dfad7ff11956b1e8779c00cf2351a4cc3b03)), closes [#&#8203;2142](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2142)\n-   show message when showHelpOnFail is chained globally ([#&#8203;2154](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/issues/2154)) ([ad9fcac](https://togithub.com/yargs/yargs/commit/ad9fcacb001a7eb842924408f3a06865a7c7a3b6))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The messages inside the container are linked with the host element using `aria-describedby` when calling `ariaDescriber.describe()`.\r\n\r\nWhen the host element is inside Shadow DOM this will not work properly because the hidden message element (that is referenced via `aria-describedby`) is outside of the Shadow DOM and will be ignored by the browser.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI actually had the problem with Angular Material Tooltips and Table Sort Header (which use AriaDescriber) but for the repro I use the AriaDescriber service directly.

This is part of our `@angular/core` migration for version 9. See [migration code](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/core/schematics/migrations/undecorated-classes-with-decorated-fields).\r\n\r\nAdding `@Directive()` here would be problematic because the `ButtonBase` class is never intended to be used in combination with dependency injection. i.e. the derived classes manually pass in the constructor parameters through a `super(..)` call. \r\n\r\nThe **problem** here is that `ngtsc` checks the constructor of `ButtonBase` now (since we added `@Directive`) and throws since it cannot find a suitable injection token for type `string`. The difference is that `ngc` does not seem to throw here. It seems to skip DI checking for abstract directives. Though `ngc` throws if some other non-abstract directive/ or component inherits the constructor from `ButtonBase`.

I know you could put the link directly in index.html, but if the oriented form is in angular.json it should be working. How to solve this issue of angular.json?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n- npm install bootstrap jquery popper.js --save (Install libs)\r\n- Configure angular.json\r\n```\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n  \"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css\",\r\n  \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n],\r\n\r\n\"scripts\": [\r\n  \"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js\",\r\n  \"node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.js\",\r\n  \"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n- Insert a component boostrap in app.component.html to test;\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\r\n  A simple primary alert—check it out!\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n- run ng serve\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre>There is no exception, the scripts and style simply do not load.<code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.6\r\nNode: 12.9.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.803.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core         8.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   8.3.6\r\n@schematics/angular          8.3.6\r\n@schematics/update           0.803.6\r\nrxjs                         6.4.0\r\n<code>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

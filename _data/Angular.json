OnPush change detection","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nI do a lot with data binding and these days making a new component means I set changeDetection to ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush and set a private cdr:ChangeDetectorRef variable in the constructor. \r\n\r\nI then create a Refresh() function that checks if the component is setup and if so will call the cdr.detectChanges() function. \r\n\r\nThis is great performance wise because I can change a variety of component properties and trigger Refresh when I want.\r\n\r\nThe down side is that changes to @Input variables don't necessarily trigger an update.\r\n\r\nSo I end up having to implement a private variable to hold data in, and use a setter and getter where the setter in addition to setting the variable will trigger a change detection.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate _someVar:string = 'helloWorld';\r\n@Input(someVar)\r\nset someVar(value:string) {\r\n  this._someVar = value;\r\n  this.Refresh();\r\n}\r\nget someVar():string {\r\n  return this._someVar;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI realize that using OnPush means I'm basically signing up for the hassle of these setters.  But it would be nice in an OnPush setup to have an @Input variant that is aware of this setup.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMy thinking was something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate _someVar:string ='Hello World';\r\n@OnPushInput(()=>{this.onRefresh()} ) someVar:string; \r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n@OnPushInput({onUpdate:()=>{this.onRefresh()}, saveAs:'_someVar'} ) someVar:string; \r\n```\r\nThat would transpile into the equivalent setter and getter for someVar that would store in private variable _someVar. \r\n\r\nThe IDEs would ideally recognize someVar in templates as bindable and I would have the option in the controller code to set this._someVar=\"something\" without triggering an update, or setting this.someVar = \"something\" which would trigger an update.\r\n\r\n@OnPushInput would be for when you want input but not necessarily bind output.\r\n\r\n@OnPushIO would be an addition evolution of this idea and would do the same thing as @OnPushInput but would additionally internally have a someVarChange:EventEmitter<somevar's type> event emitter which emits this.someVar (getter version) when the setter is used.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to have:\r\n```\r\nprivate _someVar:string = 'HelloWorld';\r\n@OnPushIO({saveAs:'_someVar',onUpdate:()=>{this.Refresh();}) someVar:string;\r\n```\r\nThis would mean, setup someVar with a getter/setter and emitter so that it is two-way bindable.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI know javascript has a defineProperty function, but that seems like overkill.\r\n\r\nThe proposed:\r\n```\r\nprivate _someVar:string = 'HelloWorld';\r\n@OnPushIO({saveAs:'_someVar',onUpdate:()=>{this.Refresh();}) someVar:string;\r\n```\r\nRight now is:\r\n```\r\nprivate _someVar:string = 'Hello World';\r\n@Input()\r\nsomeVar(val:string) {\r\n this._val = val;\r\n this.someValChange.emit(this._val);\r\n this.Refresh();\r\n}\r\nget someVar():string {\r\n return this._val;\r\n}\r\n@Output()\r\nsomeValChange = new EventEmitter<string>;\r\n```\r\nOne of the rules of thumb in refactoring is if you are doing the same thing three or more times encapsulate the repeated functionality in a function and call it from the same place.\r\n\r\nI do apologize if something like this exists, but I have not really seen it referred to in documentation or in discussions about @Input and @Output.

error. You can pass an individual deprecation ID\n    (e.g. `slash-div`) or you can pass a Dart Sass version to treat all\n    deprecations initially emitted in that version or earlier as errors.\n\n-   New `--future-deprecation` flag that lets you opt into warning for use of\n    certain features that will be deprecated in the future. At the moment, the\n    only option is `--future-deprecation=import`, which will emit warnings for\n    Sass `@import` rules, which are not yet deprecated, but will be in the future.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   New `Deprecation` enum, which contains the different current and future\n    deprecations used by the new CLI flags.\n\n-   The `compile` methods now take in `fatalDeprecations` and `futureDeprecations`\n    parameters, which work similarly to the CLI flags.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack</summary>\n\n### [`v5.76.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.76.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.76.0...v5.76.1)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Added `assert/strict` built-in to `NodeTargetPlugin`\n\n##### Revert\n\n-   Improve performance of `hashRegExp` lookup by [@&#8203;ryanwilsonperkin](https://togithub.com/ryanwilsonperkin) in [https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/16759](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/pull/16759)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The proposed solution was to add a cdkScrollable directive and a 'close' Scroll Strategy to the dropdown component used.\r\nA potential bug in Angular Material was discovered where if two nested scrollable containers exist (i.e. an overlay containing a cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport component within a scrollable window), the global scrollDispatcher would get triggered if a scroll within the dropdown occurs and this would cause the dropdown to close. Consequently, the user would never be able to scroll within the dropdown without abruptly closing it. The proposed solution for this was to inject a local scrollDispatcher instance in the overlay service, and the scroll event fired from the dropdown would not trigger the close scroll strategy.\r\nFinally, once the dropdown is closed on outside scroll, the dropdown search field should be unfocused, and for that, .detachments() was called in the overlay service.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ru7qdi-tbavjg?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.html,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.css,package.json\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe local Scroll Dispatcher instance would not be needed and scrolling within the dropdown would not trigger the closing scroll strategy, since the scroll strategy is related to scroll behavior outside of the overlay and not within it (see: https://material.angular.io/cdk/overlay/overview#scroll-strategies)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127736829/224677310-f119ff4e-5b26-4087-88c8-eec7bb65fd00.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nScrolling within the dropdown overlay causes it to close.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26780","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MATERIAL): Close Scroll Strategy is triggered by scroll behavior within the overlay\" (#26780)"},{"Id":"1618569182","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-13T09:01:35","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26765","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/chips): don't prevent default mousedown action","State":"closed","Body":"The chip row was calling `preventDefault` on `mousedown` events in order to avoid sending focus to the chip grid which in turn moves it to the first chip.

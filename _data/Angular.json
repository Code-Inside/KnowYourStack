However, and this is the critical point, _as a developer, I expect query string parameters to be available when visiting a route with query string parameters on it, full stop._\r\n\r\nWhen a component first loads, however, queryParams is _always an empty object_, regardless of whether or not there actually are query string params. The problem here is not a simple matter of then subscribing and `.skip(1)`-ing (which in and of itself is a hack, since we _already know we are going to be getting an empty object every single time,_). The important case is the very real, arguably more frequent case where there _are no query string params_, then the queryParams subscription never fires.\r\n\r\nYes, we could just subscribe, but then developers are left open to a race condition with early executing code. An added negative to this approach is that we now have created an open subscription for something that in my experience, 9 times out of 10, we only want once.\r\n\r\nThe expectation of the developer, if you simply look at the evidence in threads across the internet around this issue, is that `queryParams` gives you the query string parameters of the URL at the time the component is created. I believe this is very hard to argue against, given that this is simply how web development works. The reason I argue this is because if I go to `mysite.com?foo=bar`, I am, before the page has even loaded, specifying query string params - so why in any case ever would I expect the first retrieval of query string params to be empty - let alone _expect_ them to be empty on the first check _every single time_? This leads to literally writing extra \"workaround code\" everywhere, all the time, to get around a shortcoming - re: bug - in the framework that is of no use and provides no tangible benefit that I've been able to discern.\r\n\r\nAll arguments that I've read around \"it's hard for Angular to know because...\" are engineering problems on the Angular side that I strongly believe should be solvable.\r\n\r\nSolutions provided (a.k.a. workarounds) include all the way up to manual parsing of the URL itself which defeats a lot of the purpose of having a queryParams observable to begin with.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to opine about the technical limitations that I know nothing about within the Angular engine, I am just opening this issue because I find it hard to belive that we cannot make something as integral to web infrastructure as query string parameters available when components are instantiated. The amount of back-bending and weird code required to do something as simple as get qs params on component start up in a non-hacky, non-racey way is kind of surprising. I hate to say this, but I am resorting to manual parsing, or a simple timeout with 10ms on it, which is, yet again, another race condition.\r\n\r\nI hope the Angular team is willing to reconsider this, because none of the arguments I've seen against fixing this bug have convinced me that 1) it isn't fixable and 2) there is an actual, valid reason for not doing so.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-r7e2ib?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\nFor repro with qs params in url, go here (this is that stackblitz app):\r\n\r\nhttps://angular-ivy-r7e2ib.stackblitz.io/?foo=bar\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\nThis is all versions of angular to my knowledge.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40339","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"queryParms observable always fires empty initially\" (#40339)"},{"Id":"781592008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-07T20:35:28","Actor":"atscott","Number":"40345","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v11.0.7 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"11.0.x\" branch to the next branch (master).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40345","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v11.0.7 release\" (#40345)"},{"Id":"781582846","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-07T20:29:20","Actor":"atscott","Number":"40343","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v11.0.7\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40343","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v11.0.7\" with changelog.\" (#40343)"},{"Id":"781583126","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-07T20:18:35","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"40344","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(forms): handle standalone `<form>` tag in `NgControlStatusGroup` directive correctly","State":"open","Body":"The `NgControlStatusGroup` directive is shared between template-driven and reactive form modules.

this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 0.1100.5\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis file has a new default value of `true` for `watch`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/karma/schema.json\r\n\r\nThis breaks `ng test` usual behaviour which previously defaulted to `false` for `watch`, causing tests to hang in the command line when using `ChromeHeadless`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nCreate a new angular project using `0.1100.5`, set `karma.conf.js` to `ChromeHeadless` and run `ng test` - the tests will run.\r\nCreate a new angular project using `0.1100.6`, set `karma.conf.js` to `ChromeHeadless` and run `ng test` - the tests will not run.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via

That library is linked via package.json (local file reference as it is in a mono-repo style git repository). This library is quite large and it takes time for webpack to re-pack it. The contents get put into `vendor.js` as we have `vendorChunk` set to true. It would be nice to be able to have our library be able to be put in its own chunk file so that the vendor chunk rarely ever changes during a release (it is uncommon for us to change other packages during a release).\r\n\r\nWhile this may be possibly using tools like `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser` it would be nice to have greater customization of the chunks that are created via the core builder and angular.json.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nNew `additionalChunks` section of angular.json configuration for the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` builder.\r\nIt would allow glob matching to customize the chunks.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"additionalChunks\": {\r\n    \"myLib\": [ \"node_modules/myLib/**\" ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would package the \"myLib\" Angular library as \"myLib.[hash].js\" in the output of ng build (and a separate file for serve)\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n`@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19721","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support custom chunks for webpack / separate chunks for in-house libraries\" (#19721)"},{"Id":"779276127","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T20:33:19","Actor":"OrangeDog","Number":"19717","RawContent":null,"Title":"fileReplacements no longer works with css files","State":"closed","Body":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11451 got locked.\r\n\r\nIt used to work at one point (Angular 8), then was broken again by #19310","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19717","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"fileReplacements no longer works with css files\" (#19717)"},{"Id":"779391413","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T18:24:54","Actor":"slm-w","Number":"19718","RawContent":null,"Title":"Display TimeSpan type Data in Angular","State":"closed","Body":"Trying to show time in table but it shows me time in this format { \"ticks\": 690680000000, \"days\": 0, \"hours\": 19, \"milliseconds\": 0, \"minutes\": 11, \"seconds\": 8, \"totalDays\": 0.7993981481481481, \"totalHours\": 19.185555555555556, \"totalMilliseconds\": 69068000, \"totalMinutes\": 1151.1333333333334, \"totalSeconds\": 69068 } while i want it to be displayed in this format \"10:15:20\" \r\nHtml\r\n  <ng-container matColumnDef=\"debutJour\">\r\n        <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef mat-sort-header>\r\n          {{'::DebutJour' | abpLocalization}}\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\">\r\n          {{ element.debutJour|json }}\r\n        </td>\r\n      </ng-container>\r\n      <ng-container matColumnDef=\"duree\">\r\n        <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef mat-sort-header>\r\n          {{'::Duree' | abpLocalization}}\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\">\r\n          {{ element.duree|json }}\r\n        </td>\r\n      </ng-container>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19718","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Display TimeSpan type Data in Angular\" (#19718)"},{"Id":"777894527","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T11:29:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"19709","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): don't downlevel web-animations-js","State":"closed","Body":"This library is minified and it causes Babel to consume a lot of resources when trying to downlevel.\r\n\r\nCloses #19660","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/19709","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): don't downlevel web-animations-js\" (#19709)"},{"Id":"778885985","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T11:18:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"19716","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update to build_bazel_rules_nodejs version 3","State":"open","Body":"More info: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/wiki#migrating-to-30","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/19716","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: update to build_bazel_rules_nodejs version 3\" (#19716)"},{"Id":"778033916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-04T11:42:38","Actor":"ofirrifo","Number":"19712","RawContent":null,"Title":"Css variable in dev mode become shortened","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm using css variables for colors.\r\nfor example:\r\n```\r\n:root {\r\n--s1-N-0-color: #FFFFFF;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin prod mode it become shortened; \r\n```\r\n:root {\r\n--s1-N-0-color: #fff;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn dev mode is work as expected and it keep the hex as is.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n1.

Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to work if the `FocusMonitor` is on a parent element and set up with `checkChildren = true`. This is because the check here (https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20966/files#diff-02e96e7ea6a7d8f1caecdfdbb7cb38bdcdc5c43db34e4392723cc48765e330b7R316) fails, as `nativeElement` doesn't have a registered `FocusMonitor`. The `FocusMonitor` is instead registered on the parent.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-un8eee?file=src/app/hello.component.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open DevTools and watch the classes on `document.body`. There is a `FocusMonitor` attached to the `document.body`.\r\n1. Click on the button \"Focus test button with origin\". Note that the class `.cdk-mouse-focused` is first added, and then 5 seconds later, is replaced by the class `.cdk-keyboard-focused`. This is expected behavior. When this button is clicked, it calls `focusVia` wth `keyboard` origin on the \"Test\" button after 5 seconds.\r\n1. Now, again click on the button \"Focus test button with origin\". After clicking, and within 5 seconds, click on the button \"Test\". Now observe that the class `.cdk-mouse-focused` is present, and never changes to `.cdk-keyboard-focused`. **This is not expected behavior.** I'd expect the class to change to `.cdk-keyboard-focused` due to the fix https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20966. Unfortunately it doesn't, because the check `this._elementInfo.has(nativeElement)` fails within `focus-monitor.ts`.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: Latest\r\n- CDK/Material: Latest\r\n- Browser(s): All\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): All\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21500","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(FocusMonitor): Focus origin of already focused element doesn't change if FocusMonitor is on parent with checkChildren set to true.\" (#21500)"},{"Id":"778847384","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T18:33:35","Actor":"Neill83","Number":"21494","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-tab): tabs pagination not working when ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush active","State":"closed","Body":"https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-lqxupf?file=src/app/tab-nav-bar-basic-example.ts\r\n\r\nI want to get working the pagination when change detection is on push.

My first thought was that it might be due to the fact that we remove `aria-selected` from unselected options in order to reduce noise, but the behavior got even weirder once I got it to set `aria-selected=\"false\"`. Now VoiceOver started reading out both \"not selected\" and \"selected\" for each option, e.g. \"Coffee not selected, selected (5 of 10)\". We'll have to investigate this, because I don't see anything obvious that could be causing it. My best bet is that there's a random \"selected\" string somewhere in the DOM that is being picked up by VoiceOver.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21491","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"VoiceOver reads out \"selected\" after each mat-option inside mat-select\" (#21491)"},{"Id":"778222295","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-04T16:56:51","Actor":"Miguel-Bento-Github","Number":"21490","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update width and height types","State":"closed","Body":"Width and height can be a string, eg: '100%'","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21490","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update width and height types\" (#21490)"},{"Id":"777621980","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-03T11:45:51","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"21489","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(google-maps): add heatmap support","State":"open","Body":"Adds support for rendering heatmaps on the `google-map` component using the `map-heatmap-layer` directive. The directive is mostly a direct wrapper around the `google.maps.visualization.HeatmapLayer` class, except for the fact that it also accepts a `LatLngLiteral`, whereas the Google Maps class only accepts `LatLng` objects. I decided to add some logic to convert them automatically, because creating `LatLng` requires the Maps API to have been loaded which can lead to race conditions if it's being loaded lazily.\r\n\r\n![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4450522/103477692-e45d0a00-4dc9-11eb-9f92-6a8f7b2c4614.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21489","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(google-maps): add heatmap support\" (#21489)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2021-01-08T05:30:05.0141577Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2895}

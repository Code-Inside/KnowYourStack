I’d like to suggest a small but useful improvement to the documentation site that could enhance the developer experience when navigating through versioned docs.\n\n**Suggestion**\nIt would be incredibly helpful to include visual indicators (badges) such as **\"New\"** or **\"Updated\"** next to items in the documentation sidebar/menu that have changed since the previous major Angular release.\n\n**Why it matters**\nWhen developers browse the documentation for a specific version of Angular (e.g., 19.x or 20.x), it's currently difficult to tell what has changed or been added compared to the previous version. Adding badges like:\n\n**\"New\" – for entirely new sections/pages**\n\n**\"Updated\" – for pages with significant updates or API changes**\n\n...would make it much easier to:\n\n- Quickly locate what's new or updated in a given Angular release\n- Stay up to date with best practices and API changes\n- Use the docs more effectively without needing to compare changelogs manually\n\nThis kind of labeling is already common in the documentation of other major frameworks and tools, and it can significantly improve navigation and the learning experience.\n\n**Implementation idea**\nThese badges could be displayed for a particular version of the docs and reset or change with each new major version. They could also link to the relevant changelog entry or diff for more context.\nI really like how simply **PrimeNG** solved this on their website using exactly these kinds of badges.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7de14365-9f3b-44a5-9dd9-fecb8468ca0d)\n\n**Example in Angular:**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629818ec-bf68-42e1-ba9e-b65c38f63985)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adbbe886-22fe-4825-a040-f15ab354a366)\n\n**Thanks again for your consideration, and for all the work you put into Angular!**\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61702","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Suggestion: Add \"Updated\" and \"New\" badges in documentation menu to highlight recent changes per Angular version\" (#61702)"},{"Id":"3093105167","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-27T08:54:10","Actor":"Kotlin-GDE","Number":"61699","RawContent":null,"Title":"@HostBinding with computed signals not working in zoneless change detection","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n@HostBinding does not automatically update the DOM when bound to a computed signal in zoneless change detection mode, even though the signal value changes correctly.\n\n[angular_issue_template.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20453314/angular_issue_template.md)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo errors thrown, the binding simply doesn't update.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular Version: 19.2.12\nNode.js Version: 22.13.1\nBrowser: chrome, firefox (latest)\nOS: ubunto 24.04\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis appears to be a gap in zoneless change detection where host bindings don't automatically react to signal changes, while effect() works correctly.

That behavior change affected the `axios@0.30.0` package. This regression has been fixed, and now has test coverage.\n\n-   Add support for certain keywords as TypeScript tuple labels ([#&#8203;4192](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4192))\n\n    Previously esbuild could incorrectly fail to parse certain keywords as TypeScript tuple labels that are parsed by the official TypeScript compiler if they were followed by a `?` modifier. These labels included `function`, `import`, `infer`, `new`, `readonly`, and `typeof`. With this release, these keywords will now be parsed correctly. Here's an example of some affected code:\n\n    ```ts\n    type Foo = [\n      value: any,\n      readonly?: boolean, // This is now parsed correctly\n    ]\n    ```\n\n-   Add CSS prefixes for the `stretch` sizing value ([#&#8203;4184](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4184))\n\n    This release adds support for prefixing CSS declarations such as `div { width: stretch }`. That CSS is now transformed into this depending on what the `--target=` setting includes:\n\n    ```css\n    div {\n      width: -webkit-fill-available;\n      width: -moz-available;\n      width: stretch;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>kriszyp/lmdb-js (lmdb)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.4.0`](https://redirect.github.com/kriszyp/lmdb-js/compare/v3.3.0...v3.4.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/kriszyp/lmdb-js/compare/v3.3.0...v3.4.0)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype (quicktype-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v23.2.6`](https://redirect.github.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/b747e4b01a479d0bf3b415722cf4dd259ece6d3b...41950205609abd8c18a8e315ea87d8904f625012)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/b747e4b01a479d0bf3b415722cf4dd259ece6d3b...41950205609abd8c18a8e315ea87d8904f625012)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.40.0`](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5400)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.39.2...v5.40.0)\n\n-   Fix exporting AssignmentExpression (default assign pattern) to ESTree\n-   Fix ESTree output of object keys with quotes\n-   Fix handling of an ESTree empty `export {}` ([#&#8203;1601](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/issues/1601))\n-   Fix some `const` and `let` resulting from ESTree input ([#&#8203;1599](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/issues/1599))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This is simplest way to do that is with a data url (updating it with a real URL would cause it to have to be loaded separately, which works, but requires an extra request).\n\nWith the webpack loader, this is easily achieved with e.g. `import favicon from \"!!url-loader!favicon.ico\";` which produces a string like `data:image/x-icon;base64,....`.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd a \"data-url\" (or \"url\" or \"data\") loader with the following import parameters:\n* `mime: string` (defaults to mime type based on extension)\n* `plain: boolean` (defaults to false, controls whether base64 is enabled)\n\nSo e.g. one could do `import contents from 'foo.svg' with {loader: 'data-url', mime: 'foo/bar', plain: true}`\n\nPerhaps better names for the parameters could be found, e.g. the mime type isn't technically a mime type and can take additional parameters, e.g. `text/plain;charset=utf-8` and so on.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWithout this, the options seem to be to do this computation at runtime, e.g.:\n* `URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([uint8array], {type: mimetype}))`\n* `\"data:\" + mimetype + \";base64,\" + btoa(uint8array).replace(/\\+/g, '-').replace(/\\//g, '_')` (untested, but something like that should work)\n\nThis works, but why not have something in the framework that does the thing you want for you, and you don't have to do these fixups each time one wants to import such an asset.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30391","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add support for a data url file loader with application/esbuild builders\" (#30391)"},{"Id":"3092586817","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-27T05:32:55","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30390","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency yargs-parser to v22","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [yargs-parser](https://redirect.github.com/yargs/yargs-parser) | dependencies | major | [`21.1.1` -> `22.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/yargs-parser/21.1.1/22.0.0) |\n| [yargs-parser](https://redirect.github.com/yargs/yargs-parser) | devDependencies | major | [`21.1.1` -> `22.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/yargs-parser/21.1.1/22.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>yargs/yargs-parser (yargs-parser)</summary>\n\n### [`v22.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/yargs/yargs-parser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2200-2025-05-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/yargs/yargs-parser/compare/yargs-parser-v21.1.1...yargs-parser-v22.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   yargs is now ESM first ([#&#8203;503](https://redirect.github.com/yargs/yargs-parser/issues/503))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   yargs is now ESM first ([#&#8203;503](https://redirect.github.com/yargs/yargs-parser/issues/503)) ([6d69295](https://redirect.github.com/yargs/yargs-parser/commit/6d692953ade099375c6c5e131367968b07ae8470))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I made a script on the root monorepo level to run the script on all of the child applications. When I do this, it always seems to ADD a fake dependency to each of the app `package.json` files which is the name of that project\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nOn the root level package I have this NPM script\n```\n\"update-angular-apps\": \"npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-1 && npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-2 && npm run update-angular --prefix ./app-3\",\n```\nAnd here is what the individual app package files look like\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"name-of-app-2\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"author\": \"Me\",\n  \"description\": \"My App #2\",\n  \"homepage\": \"https://company.com/app-2\",\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/redacted/app-2.git\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\n    \"update-angular\": \"ng update @angular/cli @angular/core @angular/material --allow-dirty\",\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint --fix --max-warnings=0\",\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^19.2.17\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^19.2.17\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"@angular/service-worker\": \"^19.2.12\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.15.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^19.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^19.2.13\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^19.2.12\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"rxjs\": \"*\",\n    \"typescript\": \"*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom the root level I run `npm run update-angular-apps` and it modifies the `package.json` files with all the correct updates, and then after a little bit of time it adds a fake package to `dependencies` as a final step. It is formatted  like\n```json\n\"name-of-app-2\": \"file:\"\n```\n\nand I have to manually delete this and re-run `npm install` on each child application since it does add an entry to the `package-lock.json` file for this as well\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.13\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.12\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n... service-worker\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1902.13\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.2.13\n@angular-devkit/core              19.2.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.2.13\n@angular/cdk                      19.2.17\n@angular/cli                      19.2.13\n@angular/material                 19.2.17\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.2.17\n@schematics/angular               19.2.13\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThe root package does NOT have any Angular packages installed on it, only the child apps have them.

Being new to Angular, I was confused about whether that was naming the element that emitted an action that triggered the display of the overlay, given the name. \n\nIn fact, it does not matter where the show/hide behavior is triggered from. What this template ref variable is doing is identifying the attachment point.  \n\n**Details**\n\nIf you all agree with this idea, I'm happy to put in a PR for this myself as I realize it is a very small user experience enhancement and not anything critical. \n\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/cdk/overlay/examples","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31221","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(overlay): Suggestion for semantically clearer naming in Overlay example\" (#31221)"},{"Id":"3089635880","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-25T23:06:09","Actor":"atsjo","Number":"31220","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(form-field): Uncaught exception when used inside custom element \"TypeError: fn is not a function\" [ver >= 20.0.0-rc.1]","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n@angular/material 20.0.0-rc.0\n\n### Description\n\nWhen form-field is used inside a custom element and afterRenderEffect is triggered (_syncOutlineLabelOffset() in https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/form-field/form-field.ts), the below unhandled exception is thrown.\n\n```\nTypeError: fn is not a function\n    at AfterRenderEffectSequence.destroy (core.mjs:4238:17)\n    at debug_node-Nc-zr65s.mjs:16753:69\n    at processCleanups (debug_node-Nc-zr65s.mjs:8113:13)\n    at cleanUpView (debug_node-Nc-zr65s.mjs:8048:9)\n    at destroyViewTree (debug_node-Nc-zr65s.mjs:7984:21)\n    at destroyLView (debug_node-Nc-zr65s.mjs:8021:5)\n```\n\nThe passing of signels from one phase to the next fails when running inside a custom element.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v11.7.1...v12.0.0)\n\n[Full Changelog](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v11.7.1...v12.0.0)\n\nWe expect this release to ship in the DevTools of [Chrome 126](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule), and to PageSpeed Insights within 2 weeks.\n\n#### New Contributors\n\nThanks to our new contributors 👽🐷🐰🐯🐻!\n\n-   Ashley Rich [@&#8203;A5hleyRich](https://redirect.github.com/A5hleyRich)\n-   MrAdib [@&#8203;JohnAdib](https://redirect.github.com/JohnAdib)\n\n#### Notable Changes\n\n##### PWA Category Removal\n\nAs per [Chrome’s updated Installability Criteria](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/update-install-criteria), Lighthouse [has removed the PWA category](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15455). For future PWA testing, users will be directed to use the [updated PWA documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/progressive-web-apps/).\n\n##### SEO Category Reorganization\n\nThe SEO category has been updated to reflect the priorities of Google search in 2024. As such, several audits have been removed or moved to other categories:\n\n-   The `is-crawlable` audit is now weighted high enough to fail the SEO category on its own. ([#&#8203;15933](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15933))\n-   The `viewport` and `font-size` audits are no longer priorities for SEO, but are still important for UX in general so they have been moved to the best practices category. ([#&#8203;15930](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15930))\n-   The `plugins` audit is no longer a priority for SEO and has been removed. ([#&#8203;15928](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15928))\n-   The `tap-targets` audit is no longer a priority for SEO and has been replaced with the `target-size` audit in accessibility. ([#&#8203;15906](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15906))\n\n##### Overall Savings Deprecation\n\nThe `overallSavingsMs` value on performance diagnostic audits has been deprecated ([#&#8203;15902](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15902)). We recommend using `metricSavings.LCP` or `metricSavings.FCP` to understand the estimated metric savings of performance diagnostics.\n\n##### 🆕 New Audits\n\n-   The [`aria-conditional-attr`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-conditional-attr), [`aria-deprecated-role`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-deprecated-role) and [`aria-prohibited-attr`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-prohibited-attr) Axe checks have been added to the Lighthouse accessibility category. ([#&#8203;15963](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15963))\n-   The `redirects-http` audit has been brought back, but will only passively check for a http -> https redirect if the provided URL happens to be on http ([#&#8203;13548](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/13548))\n\n##### Other Audit Changes\n\n-   The `layout-shifts-elements` audit is removed. Improved layout shift information can be found in the `layout-shifts` audit. ([#&#8203;15931](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15931))\n-   The `no-unload-listeners` audit is removed. Unload listeners are deprecated and are still flagged in the `deprecations` and `bf-cache` audits. ([#&#8203;15874](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15874))\n-   The `duplicate-id-active` audit is removed because it's corresponding Axe check is deprecated. ([#&#8203;15900](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15900))\n-   The `uses-rel-preload` and `preload-fonts` audits have been moved to the experimental config. Preload advice is still on hold and these audits were already in a disabled state. ([#&#8203;15876](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15876))\n\n#### 💥 Breaking Changes\n\n-   split up `CSSUsage` artifact

The custom template will allow me to easily change the label text and also apply different CSS styles for time and duration\n\n\n  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a442c54-1d1a-4c94-a7f1-590b5dc27945)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31209","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(mat-timepicker): Add option template\" (#31209)"},{"Id":"3085894003","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-23T10:12:53","Actor":"sdedieu","Number":"31207","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(button): mat-mdc-button-touch-target height and width are hard coded to 48px","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nVersion 19 allows to redefine the button height using the `filled-container-height`, `outlined-container-height` and `protected-container-height`. \n\nHowever the inner mat-mdc-button-touch-target width and height are hard coded to 48px.\nWhich means, if we define a small button, touch area will overflow.\n\nThis behavior is present in the [documentation example](https://material.angular.dev/components/button/overview#button-overview), where the two button-icons have a width and height of `40px` but a touch target of `48px`.\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-adbmj5bj?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations,%20@angular/common,%20@angular/compiler,%20@angular/core,%20@angular/forms,%20@angular/platform-browser,%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic,%20@angular/router,%20core-js,%20rxjs,%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=package.json,src%2Findex.html,src%2Fglobal_styles.scss,src%2Fmain.ts,angular.json&template=node&title=Angular%20Starter\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

All the components are self contained, meaning the <mat-form-field><mat-label><component><mat-error> are inside our custom component, while the form is outside.\nSo ever since the upgrade (jump from 14 to 19) specifically the mat-error does not show until specifically clicked on the input. Regardless of any programmatical approach and actually debugging and seeing the error is present and the hasError returning true, the mat-error won't show unless physically clicked on the input. Additionally, with Autocomplete, label stops the field from being focused. I tried debugging and figuring out what and how happens and it all looks like the binding process can't correctly discern when we have an \"additional layer\" between the form tag and mat-form-field and the binding process fails. \nThe NgValueAccessor and MatFormFieldControl are both implemented and I can clearly see correct states for determining error and other states, however, the error specifically is not applied. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAs in version 14, I expect ALL the mat-form-fields to work properly regardless of how far inside the form they are. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe fields partially work.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19\n- CDK/Material: 19\n- Browser(s): All chromium based\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows/Mac\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31205","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Autocomplete): Custom Autocomplete component doesn't bind properly on form and other mat components\" (#31205)"},{"Id":"3085176195","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-23T05:05:20","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31204","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency karma-jasmine-html-reporter to v2","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [karma-jasmine-html-reporter](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter) | devDependencies | major | [`~1.7.0` -> `~2.1.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/1.7.0/2.1.0) |\n| [karma-jasmine-html-reporter](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter) | devDependencies | major | [`^1.5.4` -> `^2.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/1.7.0/2.1.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter (karma-jasmine-html-reporter)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.1.0`](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/releases/tag/v2.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0)\n\n-   Add jasmine 5 as a compatible peer dependency\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0\n\n### [`v2.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/releases/tag/v2.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter/compare/v1.7.0...v2.0.0)\n\nThis version rewrites the package to use the peer jasmine-core package instead of repackaging the html reporting code.

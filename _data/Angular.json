This is ultimately problematic for working in a Yarn pnp environment.  In fact, Angular Material's current `ng-add` logic adds one of their prebuilt styles to the `angular.json` using a relative path to `node_modules`, which is problematic on its own, but even if they adjusted it to be a package-relative path, it wouldn't work since their prebuilts are made accessible through package `exports`.\r\ne.g.:\r\n```json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n    \"@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\",\r\n    \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request is that module resolution for loading styles (and scripts) from the `angular.json` is expanded to support package `exports`, which would allow Angular Material to adjust their `ng-add` to use a package-relative path instead of a `node_modules` relative one.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nWithin a new project, run `ng add @angular/material`\r\nAfter completion, change the styles array in the `angular.json` to this:\r\n```json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n    \"@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\",\r\n    \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\nRun `ng serve`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to use the above, you get this error on build/serve, since it's treating it as a file path:\r\n```\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat 'C:\\Users\\<user>\\Desktop\\test147\\@angular'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.5\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.18\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.5\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.0.4\r\n@angular/flex-layout            14.0.0-beta.40\r\n@angular/material               14.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nI opened a related bug in the `components` repo for the update to their `ng-add` schematic to change the prebuilt styles entry to be package-relative, once this is possible: https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25242\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23568","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Module resolution used to load styles from `angular.json` doesn't work with package `exports`\" (#23568)"},{"Id":"1304703142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-14T12:16:21","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23567","RawContent":null,"Title":"CI fixes and improvements","State":"open","Body":"**ci: run snapshot job when snapshot package.json is modified**\r\n    \r\nPrior of switching to the self hosted Renovate bot, we ran `e2e-cli-ng-snapshots` job on the `main` branch and Renovate PRs that updated the Angular dependencies.

Given a library (`lib`) and a project (`app`) in an angular workspace. The library properly copies an scss file to the `dist` folder (which is the default output folder) and adds it to the `exports` section of the `package.json`. However, the consuming app cannot `@import` or `@use` the exported scss file.\r\n\r\nGiven the following files:\r\n\r\n- dist/my-company/my-lib/assets/_theme.scss\r\n- projects/app/src/styles.scss\r\n\r\nAnd the following export in the `package.json` of the library:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"exports\": {\r\n  \"./theme\": {\r\n    \"sass\": \"./assets/_theme.scss\"\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the default settings that the Angular CLI generates (with `ng new library` and so on...),\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWith the settings mentioned above, importing an exported scss file should work out of the box (currently it does not compile with the error `SassError: Can't find stylesheet to import.`).\r\n\r\n```\r\n// styles.scss\r\n@use \"@my-company/my-lib/theme\" as myTheme;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n1. Changing the default `dist` output of the library to the `node_modules` and the automatically removed `@` symbol is added to the path (in short `dist/my-company/my-lib` -> `node_modules/@my-company/my-lib`) resolves the scss import problem. The `tsconfig.json` must be adjusted as well. If this is the desired solution, then it should be the default generated with the CLI.\r\n2. Create an NPM Link to the dist directory (which has its own pros and cons). If this is the desired solution, then the `tsconfig.json` does not need to define additional `paths` and this should be an operation that the generation (through the CLI) does automatically. Or at least extend [the documentation](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#managing-assets-in-a-library).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23552","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Workspace

But I have scenarios where it fails 80% of the time. I think it got a little bit worse when I went from 13.x.x -> 14.x.x. But that might be due to other code changes. \r\nI don't think I can reproduce it in StackBlitz since it's involved a complex setup and a chain of events.\r\nBut I can certainly try if the description is not detailed enough.\r\n\r\nWhen opening dialogs the `afterOpened()` observer is not always \"called\". And since that's where I run `updateSize()` and `updatePosition()`. The dialog ends up looking like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5993909/178484322-8794ebc8-650e-429f-8276-9a00a269dda6.png)\r\n\r\nIf I run `this.cd.markForCheck()` after the dialog code the observer is called, so it definitely has something to do with Change Detection. However this is a feasible solution since I open the dialogs from a common services, where injecting ChangeDetectionref is not possible.\r\n\r\n`this.applicationRef.tick();` does not help (I thought this was a Global Change detection tick?)\r\n\r\nThe reason I think Change detection is not working properly is because we use native async/await.\r\nHowever I use the `zone.run()` code for that reason:\r\n```\r\nreturn this.zone.run(() => {\r\n    const dialog = this.matDialog.open<T>(template, { ...config, viewContainerRef: !useGlobalViewRef ? this.viewContainerRef : undefined });\r\n    dialog.afterOpened().subscribe(() => {\r\n        if (!config.width) {\r\n            dialog.updateSize();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!config.position) {\r\n            dialog.updatePosition();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    return dialog;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I still get the issue. This code responsible for calling the `afterOpened` observer is never reached:\r\n```\r\n_containerInstance._animationStateChanged.pipe((0,WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_8__.filter)(event => event.state === 'opened'), (0,WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_9__.take)(1)).subscribe(() => {\r\n  this._afterOpened.next();\r\n\r\n  this._afterOpened.complete();\r\n}); // Dispose overlay when closing animation is complete\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the dialog is created, opened and visible on screen. But the `_animationStateChanged` event does not seem to happen, which causes the `afterOpened` observable to never be \"called\".\r\n\r\nShould it be this dependent on Change detection to work? And why does running it in the zone not make the internal `Change Detection` in the `MatDialog` component to work?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `afterOpened()` observer should be \"called\"\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `afterOpened()` observer is not called due to some animationStateChange not being triggered due to Change Detection issues.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.1\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.3.1 \r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core \r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1400.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1302.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              14.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        14.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  14.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               14.0.1\r\nng-packagr                        14.0.2\r\nrxjs                              7.5.5\r\ntypescript                        4.7.3\r\nwebpack                           5.73.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25261","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatDialog): afterOpened is not always called, probably due to change detection issues\" (#25261)"},{"Id":"1301967400","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T12:05:39","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"25260","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dependency Dashboard","State":"open","Body":"This issue lists Renovate updates and detected dependencies.

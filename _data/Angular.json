For example `resource` and `linkedSignal` both use multiple signal APIs under the hood.\n\nAngular DevTools only sees the raw reactive graph, and so it displays the raw signal primitives rather than a single `resource` or `linkedSignal`. For example, I believe `resource` creates an effect for making the network request and then updates an internal signal. There's also multiple computeds for things like `hasError`.\n\nThis might be WAI from the perspective that it is more representative of what is actually happening. `resource` is not a single reactive value, and we should not mislead developers into thinking it is.\n\nCC @JeanMeche @AleksanderBodurri @milomg\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThere are two potential improvements we can make though:\n\n1. Improve `debugName` so it is clear the composed signal primitives originate from a single user-defined `resource` or `linkedSignal`.\n2. Create a visual \"group\" of signal nodes under a specific `resource` or `linkedSignal`.\n\nI'm thinking that the graph would initially just treat a `resource` as a single reactive node and any dependency on `value` or `hasError` would point to that same node. But then when the user clicks on the node, they can expand it to show all the internal signal primitives (with appropriate names) and the dependency graph adjusts to depend on the specific internals it needs. This allows developers to get a high-level view up front while still supporting the more specific details when it becomes relevant to them.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. We could hide signal internals altogether and _only_ show `resource` / `linkedSignal` as a single reactive node, but this could be misleading to developers and potentially impede debugging efforts.\n2. We could ignore the grouping solution and instead just focus on better naming, keeping the graph \"honest\", but this adds complexity where it often doesn't matter.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63227","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"DevTools signal visualization: Compound signals\" (#63227)"},{"Id":"3331455508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-18T16:57:33","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"63226","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CLI help [20.2.x]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CLI help contents.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63226","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CLI help [20.2.x]\" (#63226)"},{"Id":"3331455089","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-18T16:57:22","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"63225","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CLI help contents.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63225","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]\" (#63225)"},{"Id":"3331441397","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-18T16:52:37","Actor":"armved","Number":"63224","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo in SSR section","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

this package cannot be said to be complete without supporting it.\n\nAnother option could be to add a warning to ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDOM that it's not feature complete for SSR.\n\nSince 2015 there's been a wide support for declarative shadow DOM in all browsers and similar features have been implemented in other SSR libraries.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n``` ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-shadow-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: '<h2>This should be RED</h2>',\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom,\n  styles: 'h2 { color: red }',\n})\nexport class

HTML was rendered as if encapsulation was emulated, but the respective CSS was added to the head \"as is\" and consequently was applied incorrectly.\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n> ng

Rather, based on our experience, the current six-month major release cycle can be challenging for many teams—especially small teams or those primarily focused on delivering new features—to keep up with consistently.\n\nOur goal is to continue running our applications on the latest Angular APIs and to avoid falling behind on updates. However, the rapid pace of major releases makes this difficult in practice. We believe many developers share this concern.\n\nExtending the major release cycle while placing greater emphasis on bug fixes and patches would be a wise and balanced approach. Notably, many organizations are still maintaining applications built on legacy versions of Angular, which highlights the challenges of frequent major upgrades.\n\nWe therefore propose shifting to a 12-month major release cycle, similar to the approach taken by other major frameworks, while increasing focus on stability, bug fixes, and patches between releases.\n\nThank you very much for considering this perspective.\n- Mohssine Khaloufi\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtend Angular’s major release frequency from 6 months to 12 months, while maintaining the current cadence for minor releases, bug fixes, and security patches.\n\nUnder this model:\n\n-  Major releases would focus on significant architectural changes and breaking changes. \n- Minor releases and patches would continue to deliver improvements, optimizations, and bug fixes regularly.\n- Teams would have more time to plan, test, and adopt major upgrades without falling behind.\n- Greater emphasis would be placed on stability and long-term maintainability between major releases.\n\nThis approach would help teams stay aligned with the latest Angular APIs while reducing upgrade fatigue, particularly for small teams and organizations focused on feature development.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nExtend Long-Term Support (LTS) Releases Only\n\nPros:\n\n- Strong stability guarantees\n- Easier long-term maintenance for enterprise applications\n\nCons:\n\n- Slower adoption of new APIs and features\n- Potential fragmentation between LTS and non-LTS users","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/66843","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Versioning / Proposal to Extend Angular Major Release Frequency\" (#66843)"},{"Id":"3881863382","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-01T14:54:05","Actor":"abudygold","Number":"66860","RawContent":null,"Title":"error message not show when use applyEach for form array","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n```\nexport interface MenuData {\n\tmenuName: string;\n\tpackages: {\n\t\tpackageName: string;\n\t\tquota: number;\n\t\tprices: {\n\t\t\tpriceValue: number;\n\t\t}[];\n\t}[];\n}\n\nformModel = signal<MenuData>({\n\t\tmenuName: '',\n\t\tpackages: [],\n\t});\n\n\tformData = form(this.formModel, (schemaPath) => {\n\t\trequired(schemaPath.menuName, { message: 'Menu name is required' });\n\t\tapplyEach(\n\t\t\tschemaPath.packages,\n\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\titem: SchemaPathTree<{\n\t\t\t\t\tpackageName: string;\n\t\t\t\t\tquota: number;\n\t\t\t\t\tprices: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpriceValue: number;\n\t\t\t\t\t}[];\n\t\t\t\t}>,\n\t\t\t) => {\n\t\t\t\trequired(item.packageName, { message: 'Package Name is required' });\n\t\t\t\trequired(item.quota, { message: 'Quota is required' });\n\t\t\t\tapplyEach(\n\t\t\t\t\titem.prices,\n\t\t\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\t\t\titem: SchemaPathTree<{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpriceValue: number;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}>,\n\t\t\t\t\t) => {\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequired(item.priceValue, { message: 'Price value is required' });\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t);\n\t});\n\n@if (field.control().touched() && field.control().invalid()) {\n\t@for (error of field.control().errors();

This ensures that the artifact names do not clash between multiple jobs in a build matrix. [#&#8203;3409](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3409)\n- Improved error handling throughout the CodeQL Action. [#&#8203;3415](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3415)\n- Added experimental support for automatically excluding [generated files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/customizing-how-changed-files-appear-on-github) from the analysis. This feature is not currently enabled for any analysis. In the future, it may be enabled by default for some GitHub-managed analyses. [#&#8203;3318](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3318)\n- The changelog extracts that are included with releases of the CodeQL Action are now shorter to avoid duplicated information from appearing in Dependabot PRs.

shared menu component from aria/menu","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nWhen building a menu using [aria/menu](https://angular.dev/guide/aria/menu#menu-with-trigger) you have to have the following structure:\n\n1. an <ng-template> for cdkConnectedOverlay\n2. a container element with ngMenu\n3. another <ng-template> for ngMenuContent\n4. only then the actual ngMenuItem elements\n\nThis results in 4 structural levels that need to be repeated every time you need a new menu.\n\nI attempted to create a shared menu component (similar to Angular Material’s MatMenu) in order to reduce this complexity to 2 levels and enable an API like:\n\n```\n<button appMenuTrigger #appMenuTrigger=\"appMenuTrigger\"  [appMenu]=\"appMenu.formatMenu()\">\n  Open Menu\n</button>\n\n<app-menu #appMenu [appMenuTrigger]=\"appMenuTrigger\">\n  <app-menu-item value=\"Mark as read\">\n    <span class=\"icon material-symbols-outlined\" aria-hidden=\"true\">mark_email_read</span>\n    <span class=\"label\">Mark as read</span>\n  </app-menu-item>\n\n  <app-menu-item value=\"Snooze\">\n    <span class=\"icon material-symbols-outlined\" aria-hidden=\"true\">snooze</span>\n    <span class=\"label\">Snooze</span>\n  </app-menu-item>\n</app-menu>\n```\n\nInternally, app-menu wraps Menu and MenuContent:\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-menu',\n  imports: [OverlayModule, Menu, MenuContent],\n  template: `\n    <ng-template\n      [cdkConnectedOverlayOpen]=\"appMenuTrigger().menuTrigger.expanded()\"\n      [cdkConnectedOverlay]=\"{ origin: appMenuTrigger().nativeElement, usePopover: 'inline' }\"\n      [cdkConnectedOverlayPositions]=\"overlayPositions\"\n      cdkAttachPopoverAsChild>\n\n      <div ngMenu class=\"menu\" #formatMenu=\"ngMenu\">\n        <ng-template ngMenuContent>\n          <ng-content />\n        </ng-template>\n      </div>\n    </ng-template>\n  `\n})\nexport class AppMenu {\n  appMenuTrigger = input.required<AppMenuTrigger>();\n  formatMenu = viewChild<Menu<string>>('formatMenu');\n  overlayPositions: ConnectedPosition[] = [{originX: 'start', originY: 'bottom', overlayX: 'start', overlayY: 'top', offsetY: 4}];\n}\n```\n\nand menu items are wrapped like this:\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-menu-item',\n  template: '<ng-content />',\n  hostDirectives: [{ directive: MenuItem, inputs: ['value: value'] }]\n})\nexport class AppMenuItem {}\n```\n\n**Problem**\nWith this approach, accessibility breaks (keyboard navigation no longer works correctly). This seems to happen because `Menu` cannot properly register `MenuItem` children when they are content projected.\n\n**Proposed enhancement**\nExpose a public API on `Menu` that allows the menu to \"refresh\" in order to register the items when they are content projected.\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32731","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(aria/menu): Add possibility to create a shared menu component from aria/menu\" (#32731)"},{"Id":"3874629868","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-30T08:33:42","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32730","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove flaky test","State":"open","Body":"Removes the `harness-e2e-cli` integration test, because it's been really flaky and we don't get much out of it.

indicators rely primarily on low-contrast background color and are not sufficiently visible (WCAG 2.4.7 / 2.4.11)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWe’ve observed a recurring accessibility issue across several Angular Material components where the keyboard focus indicator relies primarily on a subtle background color change, often without a visible outline or border.\n\nIn many cases, the focus state is indicated only by a light background shade (e.g., light grey or light blue), which is difficult or impossible to perceive, especially:\n\n- For users with low vision\n- For users with color vision deficiencies\n- In bright environments or low-quality displays\n- When components are placed on similar colored backgrounds\n\n**This affects multiple components, including (but not limited to):**\n\n- Buttons\n- Icon buttons\n- List items\n- Menu items\n- Tabs\n- Select options\n- Table rows / interactive rows\n\nWhy this is an accessibility problem\nWCAG 2.4.7 – Focus Visible (Level AA)\nKeyboard focus must be visible.\n\n- In many Angular Material components, the current focus indicator:\n- Has no distinct shape (no outline, border)\n- Is visually indistinguishable from hover or selected states\n- This makes keyboard navigation extremely difficult for users who rely on visible focus.\n\n**From an accessibility testing perspective:**\n\n- Users cannot reliably tell where focus is on the page\n- Screen magnifier users lose orientation\n- Keyboard-only users frequently get “lost” in complex UIs\n- The UI technically supports keyboard, but practically fails usability\n\nThis results in applications built with Angular Material failing accessibility compliance (WCAG) unless we manually override focus styles.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nAngular Material components should provide, by default: A clearly visible focus indicator\n\nWith a distinct visual affordance, such as:\n\n- Outline\n- Border\n\nCurrently we have to implement custom global CSS overrides just to achieve basic focus visibility, which defeats the purpose of a component library that claims accessibility support out of the box.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. \n2.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAngular Material components should provide, by default: A clearly visible focus indicator\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly backgroing color appears on focus, and this color is very light and very hard to notice by the users with vision impairements. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material:\n- Browser(s):\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS,

Upgrade to 21.0.0 broke the custom scrolling strategy implementation we have used so we decided to look for alternatives. Luckily, It seems that 21.0 also introduced support for tables with sticky header (or was introduced earlier, I am actually not sure which version added support), unfortunately, version 21.1 seems to introduce a bug which makes the scrolling shift around.\n\nThe bug can be seen in the example provided in the Table documentation as well. The documentation is still running on 21.0.0 but if you upgrade the example to 21.1.1, you can start seeing the buggy behavior when scrolling.\n\nScrolling seems to be fixed when `itemSize` is set to 0, however, in infinite scrolling implementations using DataSource that rely on `collectionViewer.onViewChange` `range.end`, it will continuously fetch the next page since `range.end` will always be the max value (3rd stackblitz link in the reproduction links has an async implementation mocked example that can be tested if uncommented in `table-virtual-scroll-example.component.ts` in constructor)\n\nExample provided is on mat-table but cdkTable's behavior is the same if not worse\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \nv21.0 (original example on version 21.0): https://stackblitz.com/edit/dfp4dgn5?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts&startScript=start\nv21.1.1 (original example but on version 21.1.1): https://stackblitz.com/edit/6wi4nsxd?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts&startScript=start\nv21.1.1 with DataSource: https://stackblitz.com/edit/gt9emjwr?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftable-virtual-scroll-example.ts (much more noticeable in this example)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Scroll around using the scroll wheel (also happens when you drag around the scrollbar thumb especially visible in tables with small amount of rows)\n2. 3rd link has an infinite scrolling implementation that can be tested if uncommented in `table-virtual-scroll-example.component.ts`'s constructor\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe table should scroll correctly without shifting around\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nScrolling shifts around, some cases making it impossible to even scroll back up once you go all the way down and some cases scrolls upwards when scrolling down\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 21.1.1\n- CDK/Material: 21.1.1\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows & macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdkTable & mat-table): virtual scrolling shifting issues introduced in 21.1\" (#32715)"},{"Id":"3862892171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T23:43:21","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32714","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(aria/combobox): fix selection via keyboard by passing proper item","State":"open","Body":"Autocomplete example is broken when using keyboard navigation to select an item, as it appears selected, but then pressing clear does not have an effect.

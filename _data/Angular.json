I have an angular project to which I have added schematics support so I can update it using `ng update`. So I have a schematics folder with a `migration.json` file : \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"../../../node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/collection-schema.json\",\r\n  \"schematics\": {\r\n    \"migration01\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Update\",\r\n      \"factory\": \"./src/ng-update/index\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`tsconfig.schematics.json` : \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"target\": \"es2015\",\r\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\r\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\r\n    \"declaration\": true,\r\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n    \"lib\": [\r\n      \"dom\",\r\n      \"es2017\",\r\n      \"esnext.asynciterable\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"exclude\": [\r\n    \"**/files/*.ts\",\r\n    \"**/*.spec.ts\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`tsconfig.schematics.spec.json` : \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\r\n    \"target\": \"es2015\",\r\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\r\n    \"types\": [\r\n      \"jasmine\",\r\n      \"node\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"lib\": [\r\n        \"es2017\",\r\n        \"dom\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"declaration\": false\r\n  },\r\n  \"include\": [\r\n    \"./spec/**/*.spec.ts\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`jasmine.json` :  \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"spec_dir\": \"projects/nav-menu/schematics/spec\",\r\n  \"spec_files\": [\r\n    \"**/*.spec.js\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"helpers\": [\r\n    \"projects/nav-menu/schematics/spec/helpers/**/*.js\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"stopSpecOnExpectationFailure\": false,\r\n  \"random\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have an `ng-update` folder with `index.ts` : \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Rule, SchematicContext, SchematicsException, Tree } from \"@angular-devkit/schematics\";\r\n\r\nexport default function(): Rule {\r\n  return (tree: Tree, context: SchematicContext) => {\r\n    context.logger.warn(\"it's happening!\");\r\n\r\n    const pkgPath = \"/package.json\";\r\n    const buffer = tree.read(pkgPath);\r\n    if (buffer == null) {\r\n      throw new SchematicsException(\"Could not read package.json\");\r\n    }\r\n    const content = buffer.toString();\r\n    const pkg = JSON.parse(content);\r\n\r\n    if (pkg === null || typeof pkg !== \"object\" || Array.isArray(pkg)) {\r\n      throw new SchematicsException(\"Error reading package.json\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (!pkg.dependencies) {\r\n      pkg.dependencies = {};\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (pkg.dependencies[\"@solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration\"]) {\r\n      pkg.dependencies[\"ngx-perfect-scrollbar\"] = `^7.0.0`;\r\n      pkg.dependencies[\"ngx-device-detector\"] = null;\r\n\r\n      tree.overwrite(pkgPath, JSON.stringify(pkg, null, 2));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return tree;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`package.json` for my nav menu project : \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"@solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\r\n    \"css-element-queries\": \"~0.4.0\",\r\n    \"ngx-perfect-scrollbar\": \"^7.0.0\",\r\n    \"web-animations-js\": \"^2.3.1\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^6.0.2\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^6.0.7\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^6.0.7\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^6.0.7\",\r\n    \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\": \"6.3.0-alpha.10.1322\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"^6.0.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.8.26\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"schematics\": \"./schematics/collection.json\",\r\n  \"ng-update\": {\r\n    \"migrations\": \"./schematics/migration.json\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce I publish my package I try to update `nav-menu` in one of my other application's which use this package. I have tried a number of different commands and non of them seem to run the `migration.json` schematic on `ng update`. So I have tried : \r\n\r\n`ng update @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration --to=1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3 --migrate-only`\r\n\r\nand I get the following error: `Incompatible peer dependencies found. See above` \r\n\r\n ```\r\nPackage \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/cdk\" (requires \"6.3.3\", would install \"6.4.7\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/http\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/core\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), wouldinstall \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/common\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/router\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/platform-browser\" (requires \"6.1.10\", would install \"6.1.0\")\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/router\" (requires \"6.1.4\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"rxjs\" (requires \"6.2.2\", would install \"6.3.3\").\r\nIncompatible peer dependencies found. See above.\r\n```\r\n \r\nSo I tried with `--force` flag and I do get my `package.json` file updated but I never see my `migration.json` schematic run. \r\n\r\n`g update @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration --to=1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3 --force --migrate-only`\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"rxjs\" (requires \"6.2.2\", would install \"6.3.3\").\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/cdk\" (requires \"6.3.3\", would install \"6.4.7\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/core\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/router\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/platform-browser\" (requires \"6.1.10\", would install \"6.1.0\")\r\n                  Package \"@solarwinds/nova-xui\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/router\" (requires \"6.1.4\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n                  Package \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\" has an incompatible peer dependency to \"@angular/common\" (requires \"6.1.0\" (extended), would install \"6.1.10\").\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency rxjs @ \"6.3.3\" (was \"6.2.2\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/cdk @ \"6.4.7\" (was \"6.4.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/core @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/router @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/common @ \"6.1.10\" (was \"6.1.0\")...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure why my `ng update` command is not run. I wanted to test my `migration.json` schematic so I pointed my `collection.json` to point to `ng-update/index` so that when I run `ng add @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration@1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3` I can see if my `ng-update` code work and it does work as expected (Note: this was only to test purpose and I do not intend to use `ng add` to run migrations). Here is the output  :  \r\n\r\n```\r\nTREHMAN-MB:web-application-seed tanzeel.rehman$ ng add @solarwinds/nav-menu-with-migration@1.0.0-nav-menu-with-migration.3Installing packages for tooling via npm.\r\nnpm WARN @solarwinds/nav-menu@2.2.0 requires a peer of @solarwinds/nova-xui@6.3.0-alpha.10.1322 but none is installed.

'serverside_validation_error',\r\n    ENTITY_NOT_EXISTENT_ERROR_KEY = 'entity_not_existent_error',\r\n    DEPENDENT_ENTITY_ERROR_KEY = 'dependent_entity_error',\r\n    DUPLICATE_ERROR_KEY = 'duplicate_error',\r\n  }\r\n\r\nexport default class Utils {\r\n```\r\n\r\nImport the enum like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\nimport Utils, {ErrorCode} from \"../utils\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'adresse',\r\n  templateUrl: './adresse.component.html'\r\n})\r\nexport class AdresseComponent {\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get errorCodes() {\r\n    return ErrorCode\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run: `ng build --prod`\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be related to #10655 but this time setting buildOptimzier and optimisation in angular.json to false does not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nTurning off Ahead of Time compilation seems to help for now.\r\n\r\n### The log given by the failure\r\n\r\n```\r\nReferenceError: Can't find

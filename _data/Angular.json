Angular is not doing so hot on the StackOverflow annual surveys, coming in as the \"most dreaded\" framework for 3 years in a row and counting. A glance at the npm stats is eye-opening.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55965128/225167579-63b22951-a718-41e1-b9ea-04a3fc476a78.png)\r\n\r\nI think this is actually a shame, as Google hires brilliant people and leads the world's internet in almost every other way. I think the Angular team could really benefit from considering changes that would earn some reputation among the developers who are clamoring for a better DX. With the introduction of signals, you've already started seeing some positive light shone on the framework among both the common community and the influential voices in it. Let's capitalize on that while we have the momentum!\r\n\r\nThe popular trend is moving toward simplified code with less boilerplate, and functional components have been a great way to achieve that. React is the obvious example here, despite some criticisms of its hooks. Vue3 came next with its setup scripts, dramatically reducing its boilerplate. And now we're in a new era of front end frameworks, where Solid is making its debut with functional components that only run once, while subsequent renders are centered around signals.\r\n\r\nAngular brings a unique perspective to development that may be overlooked and undervalued, specifically because people don't look long enough to see it. Some of its notable strengths are _prescribed architecture_, _resilience to bugs_, and its _powerful CLI_. Let's see if we can get away with sprinkling a little bit of DX without sacrificing any of that! I think functional components would be a very interesting place to start.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe following demonstrates one possible idea for how this could be implemented in Angular. Please keep in mind, this is very raw and unrefined - the primary purpose of the feature request is to get some feedback and discussion brewing in both the Angular team and the greater dev community.\r\n\r\nAnother note just for transparency, I'm out of practice when it comes to Angular, so a lot of my experience may be more reflective of what I'm used to seeing in React/Next and Vue/Nuxt. If this discussion gains traction, I will be more than happy to refresh myself on the more advanced usage and contribute any way I can.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { setupComponent, signal } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HeroService } from '../../services/hero.service';\r\n\r\nexport const define = setupComponent({\r\n  selector: 'app-hero-list',\r\n  inject: { heroService: HeroService },\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst HeroListComponent = ({\r\n  ngInput,\r\n  ngOutput,\r\n  ngComponent,\r\n  heroService,\r\n}) => {\r\n\r\n  // I/O\r\n  const title = ngInput<string>('Hero List'); // defines an Input (prop)\r\n  const onSelect = ngOutput<Hero>(); // defines an EventEmitter\r\n\r\n  // component state\r\n  const heroes = signal<Hero[]>([]);\r\n  const selectedHero = signal<Hero | null>(null);\r\n  const selectHero = (hero: Hero) => {\r\n    selectedHero.set(hero);\r\n    onSelect.emit(hero);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // fetch data\r\n  heroService.fetchHeroes().subscribe((resultHeroes: Hero[]) => {\r\n    heroes.set(resultHeroes);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // provide values to the template and return it\r\n  //  *notes:\n  //    - this could be made simpler with JSX or even lit-html, if we forego the Angular templating.\n  //    - you could potentially use `templateUrl` here too.\r\n  return ngComponent({\r\n    provide: { title, heroes, selectHero, selectedHero },\r\n    template: `\r\n      <h2>{{ title }}</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p><em>Select a hero from the list to see details.</em></p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li *ngFor=\"let hero of heroes()\">\r\n          <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"selectHero(hero)\">\r\n            {{ hero.name }}\r\n          </button>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <app-hero-detail *ngIf=\"selectedHero()\" [hero]=\"selectedHero()\"></app-hero-detail>\r\n    `,\r\n  });\r\n\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default HeroListComponent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis part could happen under the hood, but it could be important for testing's sake:\r\n```ts\r\nimport HeroListComponent, { define } from 'heroList.component';\r\ndefine(HeroListComponent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the code more or less speaks for itself, but here are some things to note:\r\n\r\n- The `define` exported function would be replaceable with a mock version, which would inject mock dependencies like that HeroService.\r\n- This component function would be run once like Solid, not repeatedly like React.\r\n- Notice all dependencies are destructured from the params instead of being imported directly. This is intentional, because such a pattern tends to be slightly easier to test.\r\n- Opting out of decorators like this may be more attractive to conscientious devs who don't like the idea of supporting a [non-standard feature](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) using compiler magic to force it to work across platforms.\r\n- You may even consider supporting JSX here... but on the other side of things, I imagine `templateUrl: './heroList.component.html'` could be an option to maintain the separation as well. Worth noting, I don't think a lot of modern developers value markup separation at this point, because the [concerns are separated differently these days](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/modern-day-separation-of-concerns-74e79ff87767).

error. You can pass an individual deprecation ID\n    (e.g. `slash-div`) or you can pass a Dart Sass version to treat all\n    deprecations initially emitted in that version or earlier as errors.\n\n-   New `--future-deprecation` flag that lets you opt into warning for use of\n    certain features that will be deprecated in the future. At the moment, the\n    only option is `--future-deprecation=import`, which will emit warnings for\n    Sass `@import` rules, which are not yet deprecated, but will be in the future.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   New `Deprecation` enum, which contains the different current and future\n    deprecations used by the new CLI flags.\n\n-   The `compile` methods now take in `fatalDeprecations` and `futureDeprecations`\n    parameters, which work similarly to the CLI flags.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack</summary>\n\n### [`v5.76.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.76.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.76.0...v5.76.1)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Added `assert/strict` built-in to `NodeTargetPlugin`\n\n##### Revert\n\n-   Improve performance of `hashRegExp` lookup by [@&#8203;ryanwilsonperkin](https://togithub.com/ryanwilsonperkin) in [https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/16759](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/pull/16759)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The proposed solution was to add a cdkScrollable directive and a 'close' Scroll Strategy to the dropdown component used.\r\nA potential bug in Angular Material was discovered where if two nested scrollable containers exist (i.e. an overlay containing a cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport component within a scrollable window), the global scrollDispatcher would get triggered if a scroll within the dropdown occurs and this would cause the dropdown to close. Consequently, the user would never be able to scroll within the dropdown without abruptly closing it. The proposed solution for this was to inject a local scrollDispatcher instance in the overlay service, and the scroll event fired from the dropdown would not trigger the close scroll strategy.\r\nFinally, once the dropdown is closed on outside scroll, the dropdown search field should be unfocused, and for that, .detachments() was called in the overlay service.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ru7qdi-tbavjg?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.html,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-overlay-basic-example.css,package.json\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe local Scroll Dispatcher instance would not be needed and scrolling within the dropdown would not trigger the closing scroll strategy, since the scroll strategy is related to scroll behavior outside of the overlay and not within it (see: https://material.angular.io/cdk/overlay/overview#scroll-strategies)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127736829/224677310-f119ff4e-5b26-4087-88c8-eec7bb65fd00.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nScrolling within the dropdown overlay causes it to close.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26780","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MATERIAL): Close Scroll Strategy is triggered by scroll behavior within the overlay\" (#26780)"},{"Id":"1621003997","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-13T08:45:22","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26779","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tooltip): match panel to trigger in test harness","State":"open","Body":"The tooltip harness was written the assumption that only tooltip can be shown on the page at a time, however in tests that might not be the case.

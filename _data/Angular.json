In particular, the following methods are specified with negative indices. On negative indices, each method behaves just like a corresponding Array method:\r\n* `FormArray.at(index)`: behaves the same as `Array.at(index)`\r\n* `FormArray.insert(index, control)`: behaves the same as `Array.splice(index, 0, control)`\r\n* `FormArray.setControl(index, control)`: behaves the same as `Array.splice(index, 1, control)`\r\n* `FormArray.removeAt(index, control)`: behaves the same as `Array.splice(index, 1)`\r\n\r\nPrevious work in #44746 and #44631 (by @amitbeck).\r\n\r\nIssue #44642.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Amit Beckenstein <amitbeck@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other... Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n`FormArray` has various unpredictable behaviors with negative indices:\r\n\r\n- `at` returns undefined\r\n- `insert` works correctly\r\n- `removeAt` works in trivial cases, but fails to call `_registerOnCollectionChange`\r\n- `setControl` performs a nonsense transformation\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n`FormArray` accepts negative indices, and treats them according to comparable basic `Array` methods. \r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\nYes, this is technically a breaking change. However, the current behavior of `FormArray` with negative indices is not reliable (e.g. `setControl` produces garbage results), so I'd be surprised if many people are relying on it. I will run a TGP in google3 to determine the extent of breakage.\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44848","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): support negative indices in FormArray methods.\" (#44848)"},{"Id":"1115377539","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-27T01:42:13","Actor":"nawlbergs","Number":"44836","RawContent":null,"Title":"[BUG] WebWorker is still typescript in dist folder. IE11 Support.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nDon't known / other\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n# tldr:\r\n- im need to support IE11 (so still on v12)\r\n- the web-worker file generated via cli is still a `.ts` file inside my dist folder (IE no likey)\r\n- the docs that that show you how to get your web-worker url using `include.meta` did not return the correct path in IE11.\r\n\r\n# What happened\r\n1. Using https://v12.angular.io/guide/web-worker\r\n2. I added web-worker via cli to my poject.. it added a tsconfig file.. updated my angular.json etc.\r\n3. I moved my webworker code into a service and updated paths..\r\n    ` Worker = new Worker(new URL('./../super-logic.worker', import.meta.url));`\r\n4. Everything ran fine in chrome.. but now IE11 was throwing `Object doesn't not support this action`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What  was wrong\r\n\r\n### First Issue\r\nAfter farting around for a few hours (adding shims.. looking at compiled code etc etc).. i realized the actual file in the dist folder was not `.js` but still a `.ts` file!  The url being provided to the Worker via (`new URL('./../super-logic.worker', import.meta.url)`) was `...../survey/super-logic.ts`.. and obviously IE11 didnt like that. (`/survey` is my dist/route)\r\n\r\n**My Fix**: Changed the worker to a `js` file and edited the `tsconfig.webworker.ts` to only include `.js` files:\r\n```\r\n  \"include\": [\r\n    \"src/**/*.worker.js\"\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Second Issue\r\nDuring my debugging... I added console logs to my service to print out the url to the service worker.  For some reason, IE11 was producing a different URL than what Chrome was.\r\n- Chrome: `...mydomain.local/survey/8230219b602f9582c8b7.js`\r\n- IE11: `...mydomain.local/survey/take/8230219b602f9582c8b7.js`\r\nSo again.. obviously IE could not find the file...   The service was provided in root.. but it might be important to note that this service was being injected from a module which was being lazy-loaded.\r\n\r\n**My Fix**:  Since all the files are dumped in root of the dist folder... I just hard-coded the path to the dist folder into service and used the generated filename provided by the new URL:\r\n```javascript\r\n      const url = new URL('./../../shared/workers/logic-worker.worker', import.meta.url);\r\n      // IE11 hack.. for some reason this is wrong.. just force to dist folder root\r\n      const finalUrl = `/survey/${url.toString().split('/').pop()}`;\r\n      this.worker = new Worker(finalUrl);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps others with this issue if nothing else.  Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 12.1.4\r\nNode: 12.22.9\r\nPackage Manager: npm 7.24.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.1.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1201.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   12.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            12.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      12.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                    12.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular             12.1.4\r\nng-packagr                      12.2.6\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.3.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44836","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[BUG] WebWorker is still typescript in dist folder.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/13.1.3...13.2.0)\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n#####\n\n-   The `CachedResourceLoader` and `RESOURCE_CACHE_PROVIDER` symbols were previously necessary in some cases to test AOT-compiled components with View Engine, but they are no longer needed since Ivy.\n\n-   The `ComponentFactory` and `ComponentFactoryResolver` classes are deprecated. Since Ivy, there is no need to resolve Component factories. Please use other APIs where you Component classes can be used directly (without resolving their factories).\n\n-   Since Ivy, the `CompilerOptions.useJit` and `CompilerOptions.missingTranslation` config options are unused, passing them has no effect.\n\n#####\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [9c11183e74](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9c11183e74980b12c3c5712df174e90af6f19027) | docs | deprecate `CachedResourceLoader` and `RESOURCE_CACHE_PROVIDER` symbols ([#&#8203;44749](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44749)) |\n| [9f12e7fea4](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9f12e7fea434c6d33e1155994e2c228d51520744) | docs | deprecate `ComponentFactory` and `ComponentFactoryResolver` symbols ([#&#8203;44749](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44749)) |\n| [4e95a316ce](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4e95a316cef35a771cd8168e3a744eb6bd7f1615) | docs | deprecate unused config options from the `CompilerOptions` interface ([#&#8203;44749](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44749)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [a4ab6d6b72](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a4ab6d6b72fe891f232d2446f8b7c454a82a5ba0) | feat | add support for safe calls in templates ([#&#8203;44580](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44580)) |\n| [abd1bc8039](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/abd1bc8039ade4324f91fd616c82e52f05bdbb70) | fix | correct spans when parsing bindings with comments ([#&#8203;44785](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44785)) |\n| [ed67a074ce](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ed67a074ceed6440bf7f638512a20bbd3be8cbd4) | fix | properly compile DI factories when coverage reporting is enabled ([#&#8203;44732](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44732)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [fa835b5a29](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fa835b5a297087087eac2750b662096ed5492cb6) | feat | enable extended diagnostics by default ([#&#8203;44712](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44712)) |\n| [73424def13](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/73424def130ae1d72036142f6f2d7bce63858c9e) | feat | provide the animations for `DirectiveMeta` ([#&#8203;44630](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44630)) |\n| [fe3e4d6865](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/fe3e4d6865c1e760be0511cfd757b4574a67fa5b) | fix | Handle `ng-template` with structural directive in indexer ([#&#8203;44788](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44788)) |\n| [7316e72ec5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7316e72ec5ccc475e610bf26b5da451b8ffa50a2) | fix | properly index <svg> elements when on a template ([#&#8203;44785](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44785)) |\n| [100091ebf0](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/100091ebf0ad480e94b5db4f183f9bfcfe8b8274) | fix | remove leftover `_extendedTemplateDiagnostics` requirements ([#&#8203;44777](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44777)) |\n| [d2ae96f742](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d2ae96f742c82daa6c4d4b8afd3b0959fb9b89d1) | fix | skip `ExtendedTemplateCheckerImpl` construction if there were configuration errors ([#&#8203;44778](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44778)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [5626b34264](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5626b34264d8893fece74d30db4920a685f3b17f) | fix | consistently use namespace short name rather than URI ([#&#8203;44766](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44766)) |\n| [94bfcdd9de](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/94bfcdd9de234f7189daaa06a6c179d9697bef8d) | fix | error if NgZone.isInAngularZone is called with a noop zone ([#&#8203;44800](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/44800)) |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [72092ebd26](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/72092ebd26d6670a7dd02f6db5515d2afd27c4d6) | feat | Allow a FormControl to use initial value as default.

Importing a file with the `file` loader causes the imported file to be copied to the output directory and causes the imported value to be the relative path from the output JS file to that copied file. This bug meant that if the `--asset-names=` setting also contained `[hash]` and the file loaded with the `file` loader was changed, the hash in the copied file name would change but the hash of the JS file would not change, which could potentially result in a stale JS file being loaded. Now the hash of the JS file will be changed too which fixes the reload issue.\n\n-   Prefer the `import` condition for entry points ([#&#8203;1956](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1956))\n\n    The `exports` field in `package.json` maps package subpaths to file paths. The mapping can be conditional, which lets it vary in different situations. For example, you can have an `import` condition that applies when the subpath originated from a JS import statement, and a `require` condition that applies when the subpath originated from a JS require call. These are supposed to be mutually exclusive according to the specification: https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports.\n\n    However, there's a situation with esbuild where it's not immediately obvious which one should be applied: when a package name is specified as an entry point. For example, this can happen if you do `esbuild --bundle some-pkg` on the command line. In this situation `some-pkg` does not originate from either a JS import statement or a JS require call. Previously esbuild just didn't apply the `import` or `require` conditions. But that could result in path resolution failure if the package doesn't provide a back-up `default` condition, as is the case with the `is-plain-object` package.\n\n    Starting with this release, esbuild will now use the `import` condition in this case. This appears to be how Webpack and Rollup handle this situation so this change makes esbuild consistent with other tools in the ecosystem. Parcel (the other major bundler) just doesn't handle this case at all so esbuild's behavior is not at odds with Parcel's behavior here.\n\n-   Make parsing of invalid `@keyframes` rules more robust ([#&#8203;1959](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1959))\n\n    This improves esbuild's parsing of certain malformed `@keyframes` rules to avoid them affecting the following rule. This fix only affects invalid CSS files, and does not change any behavior for files containing valid CSS. Here's an example of the fix:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    @&#8203;keyframes x { . }\n    @&#8203;keyframes y { 1% { a: b; } }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;keyframes x{y{1% {a: b;}}}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;keyframes x{.}@&#8203;keyframes y{1%{a:b}}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v12.0.3`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v12.0.2...v12.0.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v12.0.2...v12.0.3)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Feature request\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [X] new\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFor prerelease testing, it's pretty common to make a new application, switch it to `next` dependencies, and then test out a new feature.

This could potentially take the form of a new attribute, `mat-inline`, placed on a `mat-button`.  \r\n\r\nThis is an image of what I'm imagining a regular `mat-button` compared against a `mat-inline mat-button` would look like: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6538289/151215652-7f6e6acf-99b0-4bdb-b928-da94642f3a36.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sample Usage**\r\n```\r\n<button mat-flat-button mat-inline color=\"accent\">\r\n  <mat-icon>account_circle</mat-icon>\r\n  W/ Inline\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Potential Implementation**\r\n```\r\n.mat-button-base[mat-inline] {\r\n    .mat-button-wrapper {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        align-items: center;\r\n    }\r\n    .mat-icon {\r\n        height: 18px;\r\n        width: 18px;\r\n        font-size: 18px;\r\n        margin: 0 8px 0 -4px;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[dir='rtl'] .mat-button-base[mat-inline] .mat-icon {\r\n    margin: 0 -4px 0 8px;\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Use Case\n\nWhenever a user is creating an icon button, a user wouldn't have to refer to the material documentation & have to add these styles manually within their projects.  \r\n\r\nIt helps to ensure alignment with Material's specs.

Build breaks\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is that i can use the palette as any other palette but im not required to add both 100, 500 & 700 hue and the build to not break when i do so.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild failed\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.1.3\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.1.3\r\n- Browser(s): all\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24268","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(COMPONENT): build breaks if following hues 100, 500 and 700 is not present in color palettes\" (#24268)"},{"Id":"1113196385","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-24T22:13:19","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"24266","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: Add golden tests to MDC migration script","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24266","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: Add golden tests to MDC migration script\" (#24266)"},{"Id":"1113076740","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-24T22:09:46","Actor":"devversion","Number":"24264","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: setup integration test for harnesses with selenium-webdriver","State":"closed","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24264","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: setup integration test for harnesses with selenium-webdriver\" (#24264)"},{"Id":"1112090357","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-24T11:15:16","Actor":"jfan0888","Number":"24261","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(mat-radio-button): I can't use `color` attribute in the <mat-radio-button>","State":"closed","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-radio-group aria-label=\"Select an option\">\r\n  <mat-radio-button value=\"1\" color=\"primary\">Option 1</mat-radio-button>\r\n  <mat-radio-button value=\"2\" color=\"accent\">Option 2</mat-radio-button>\r\n  <mat-radio-button value=\"3\" color=\"warn\">Option 3</mat-radio-button>\r\n  <mat-radio-button value=\"4\" color=\"info\">Option 4</mat-radio-button>\r\n</mat-radio-group>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to create a custom material theme and use `info` theme palette like below.\r\n`<mat-radio-button value=\"4\" color=\"info\">Option 4</mat-radio-button>`\r\n\r\n### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nFor the other components like button, toggle, checkbox, I can use color=\"info\" palette.\r\n\r\n`<mat-radio-button value=\"4\" color=\"info\">Option 4</mat-radio-button>`\r\n\r\nI expect `mat-info` class in the `<mat-radio-button>`, but not working :(\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-radio-button _ngcontent-csm-c296=\"\" class=\"mat-radio-button example-radio-button mat-radio-checked\" ng-reflect-value=\"Winter\" id=\"mat-radio-2\">\r\n ...\r\n ...\r\n</mat-radio-button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/radio/examples\r\nyou can add color=\"info\" in the `<mat-radio-button>`\r\n```\r\n<mat-radio-group aria-label=\"Select an option\">\r\n  <mat-radio-button value=\"1\" color=\"primary\">Option 1</mat-radio-button>\r\n  <mat-radio-button value=\"2\" color=\"accent\">Option 2</mat-radio-button>\r\n  <mat-radio-button value=\"3\" color=\"warn\">Option 3</mat-radio-button>\r\n  <mat-radio-button value=\"4\" color=\"info\">Option 4</mat-radio-button>\r\n</mat-radio-group>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: v13\r\n- CDK/Material: v13\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24261","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"help(mat-radio-button): I can't use `color` attribute in the <mat-radio-button>\" (#24261)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-01-27T03:30:03.8192055Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2721}

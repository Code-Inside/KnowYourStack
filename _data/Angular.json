The issue appeared after updating @angular/core and @angular/router from 17.2.2 to 17.3.1. In 17.2.2 it works as expected, the params returned are the ones of the current route.\r\n\r\nI provide a link to a minimal reproduction repo. In order to reproduce the issue is important to follow these steps:\r\n1. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/id-1/child \r\n2. Click the '/id-2' link to route to http://localhost:4200/id-2\r\n3. Click the '/id-2/child' link to route to http://localhost:4200/id-2/child\r\n4. Click the \"Click and check console\" button\r\n5.

We introduced a fix to remove the event listener, but it was erroneously stored on the `taskData`, which is a shared global object. Consequently, when something attempted to remove an event listener, it immediately removed the last stored abort listener. As a result, events would never be canceled.\r\n\r\nWe have now rectified this by storing the remove abort listener function directly on the task itself. This adjustment ensures that the abort listener is tied only to the specific task. When the `abort` function is called, it cancels the task. Therefore, it is safe to associate the cleanup function directly with the task.\r\n\r\nCloses: #56148","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56160","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(zone.js): store remove abort listener on the scheduled task\" (#56160)"},{"Id":"2323752336","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-29T16:38:06","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"56159","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56159","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.1.0-next.0\" with changelog.\" (#56159)"},{"Id":"2323698480","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-29T16:13:57","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"56158","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56158","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.1 release\" (#56158)"},{"Id":"2323632420","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-29T16:05:21","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"56156","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56156","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.1\" with changelog.\" (#56156)"},{"Id":"2323271824","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-29T13:00:15","Actor":"rainerhahnekamp","Number":"56155","RawContent":null,"Title":"Explicit Tracking for `effect()`: Request for Reconsideration","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nWe have been refactoring an application towards using Angular's Signals. During this process, we observed a recurring pattern where effects inevitably require the use of `untracked`. This pattern has revealed several issues:\r\n\r\n1. **Frequent Use of `untracked`:** Developers frequently need to use `untracked` to prevent unintended side effects in signals, making it a standard practice in our codebase.\r\n2. **Error-Prone Nature:** The necessity of `untracked` is not well-known among developers, leading to common errors when it is omitted.\r\n3. **Maintenance Overhead:** Constantly ensuring that `untracked` is correctly applied adds to the maintenance burden and cognitive load on developers.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we propose that Angular effects should adopt an explicit tracking model. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\n1. **Explicit Declaration:** Developers should explicitly declare dependencies within effects, rather than relying on automatic tracking.\r\n2. **Default Non-Tracking:** By default, effects should not track dependencies unless explicitly specified, reducing the need for `untracked`.\r\n\r\n**Example Scenario:**\r\nCurrently, developers write:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n\r\nid = input.required<number>();\r\n\r\neffect(() => {\r\n  // Part 1: Tracking\r\n  const id = this.id();\r\n\r\n  // Part 2: Execution\r\n  untracked(() => {\r\n    this.dataService.load(id);\r\n  });\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith explicit tracking, it would look like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nid = input.required<number>();\r\n\r\neffect(this.id, (id) => {\r\n  this.dataService.load(id);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n1. **Reduced Errors:** Explicit tracking minimizes the risk of overlooking `untracked`, leading to more predictable and stable code.\r\n2. **Improved Developer Experience:** Clearer dependency management simplifies understanding and maintaining the code.\r\n3. **Enhanced Performance:** Explicit tracking can optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-computations and side effects.\r\n\r\n**Internal API and Library Ecosystem:**\r\nIt is noteworthy that some parts of the internal Angular API already utilize automatic `untracked`. While this is beneficial, other libraries face similar problems and would benefit if the untracking responsibility was handled by the caller. This approach can provide more consistent and error-free usage across different codebases and libraries.\r\n\r\n**Prior Discussion:**\r\nThis issue was previously raised in \r\n- [Issue #54548](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54548#issuecomment-1961712985)\r\n- [PR 54614](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54614)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this enhancement.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Introducing a fourth \"effect-like\" function with explicit tracking\r\n- Keep it as it is","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56155","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Explicit Tracking for `effect()`: Request for Reconsideration\" (#56155)"},{"Id":"2323228865","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-29T12:41:26","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"56154","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(migrations): do not generate aliased variables with the same name","State":"open","Body":"Adds some logic to avoid generating expressions like `let $index = $index` in the control flow migration.\r\n\r\nFixes #56152.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56154","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(migrations): do not generate aliased variables with the same name\" (#56154)"},{"Id":"2323178211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-29T12:17:09","Actor":"s0h311","Number":"56153","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update creating-libraries.md add language=\"json\"","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

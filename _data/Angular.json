I understand, a `ComponentFixture` has two ways of working: with, or without changes auto-detection.\r\n\r\nIn reality, setting `autoDetectChanges` to `false` (even though it's supposed to already be `false` by default) has the same (partial) effect as setting it to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

repro, you'll find three similar tests, for an OnPush component.\r\n- the first one doesn't call `fixture.autoDetechChanges()` at all (so it leaves it to false)\r\n- the second one call `fixture.autoDetechChanges(false)`\r\n- the third one call `fixture.autoDetechChanges(true)`\r\n\r\nMy expectation is that the second one should pass: it should behave exactly like the first one, because setting autoDetectChanges to false when it's already false (by default) shouldn't change anything.\r\n\r\nBut the second one fails for the same reason as the third one.\r\n\r\nYou can run the

Specifically, our builder adds plugins to webpack for handling fonts and SVGs from assets, which are subsequently included in indexHtml, along with additional scripts.\r\n\r\nI attempted to use a `buildApplicationInternal` equivalent for esbuild, but I encountered difficulties retrieving fonts and SVG information in the `onEnd` callbacks to use later in `indexHtmlTransformer` - not all information about media files is returned in metafile.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for guidance on the best approach to take when working with esbuild, considering the need to maintain our existing logic.\r\nIs it save to use `buildApplicationInternal` in the future?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I tried to run the project with ng serve. However, instead of launching Vite, webpack is initiated.\r\n\r\nThis might be because `ng serve `uses the `isEsbuildBased` function for verification, which only checks:\r\n```\r\nfunction isEsbuildBased(builderName) {\r\n    if (builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:application' ||\r\n        builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild') {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni have my custom builder name there.\r\n\r\nI might be missing something here, but there is no documentation for these cases.

Also when scrolling through the list, closing and reopening the menu, the list is empty. Resizing the window solves all the problems.

For this, I used a **mat-autocomplete** on a **mat-input**, and a **mat-chip-grid** to display the values. To handle the input state, there is a signal with two-way binding using [(ngModel)]. \r\n\r\nIn this particular case, it seems that updating the signal linked to the ngModel does not update the input value.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n**StackBlitz link**: https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview#chips-autocomplete (the stackblitz from the official documentation showcase this bug)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n1. Type the letter 'a'\r\n2. Click on 'Apple' to add the apple to the multi-selection\r\n3. Despite the signal being set to an empty string, the input is still displaying 'a'\r\n\r\n_Note: the signal state is correctly used to filter, which means that clicking on the input will display all values (despite the displayed 'a', which should supposedly be used to filter). For example, if you change the code to do `this.currentFruit.set('apple')` and reproduce this bug again, only the Apple element will be displayed when clicking a second time on the autocomplete (despite having only 'a' displayed)_ \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input should reflect the signal state correctly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input is not updated according to the signal state.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.6\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu, probably?

They give full control over theming:\r\n* Theme variable values are available at runtime.\r\n* Theme variable values can be adjusted at runtime.\r\n* Changing the entire theme is just a matter of supplying different values for the `sys-` variables.\r\n* Using any theme variable anywhere in the app can be done using the CSS variables. No need for importing any SASS logic from `@angular/material`.\r\n\r\nDefining and using a theme is as simple as:\r\n```scss\r\n@use \"@angular/material\" as mat;\r\n\r\n$theme: mat.define-theme(\r\n  (\r\n    color: (\r\n      theme-type: light,\r\n      primary: mat.$cyan-palette,\r\n      tertiary: mat.$magenta-palette,\r\n      use-system-variables: true,\r\n    ),\r\n    typography: (\r\n      use-system-variables: true,\r\n    ),\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.system-level-colors($theme);\r\n  @include mat.system-level-typography($theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this one can easily define a bunch of such defined themes, and then load one based on user settings. Alternatively a backend endpoint could render the CSS file with the `sys-` variables.\r\n\r\n## The issue\r\nEverything in Angular Material nicely supports system-level themes, except the component theming mixins. \r\nWe still are still required to do something like:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n    @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not nice, because we now have generic styling code that needs to use a specific theme. \r\n\r\nA solution would be to allow passing something like this:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes((use-system-variables: true));\r\n  // Or available on mat.\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes(mat.$system-variables-theme);\r\n  // Or allow passing no theme\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nCreate your own `$system-variables-theme`, and use it:\r\n```scss\r\nhtml {\r\n  $system-variables-theme: mat.define-theme(\r\n    (\r\n      color: (\r\n        use-system-variables: true,\r\n      ),\r\n      typography: (\r\n        use-system-variables: true,\r\n      ),\r\n    )\r\n  );\r\n  @include mat.all-component-themes($system-variables-theme);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nEasy and clean theming, with minimal theme files.\r\nI'm not sure whether the current workaround is 'ergonomic' enough. If it is, it should at least be added to the documentation.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(system-level-variables): Allow calling component mixins without specific theme\" (#29374)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-07-09T03:30:02.2463705Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1423}

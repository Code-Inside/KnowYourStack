a reproduction with SSR on Stackblitz, so please read it first and check the videos - perhaps you'll see what I'm talking about and what could cause that and perhaps it is a duplicate (I tried searching).\n\nSo, in the template, we have:\n```html\n...\n@if (store.$isAuthenticated()) {\n      <div class=\"nav-btn\" (click)=\"...\">\n        <mat-icon svgIcon=\"account\"/>\n        <span

i18n=\"@navbar.signup\" class=\"btn-label\">Sign Up</span>\n      </div>\n}\n...\n```\nAs you can see, they can **never** be rendered together.\nBut if I use `withI18nSupport()`:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53d7b5c1-dc55-4aed-a9a5-4ec479cd1a9c\n\n\nAnd if I remove `withI18nSupport()`:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5cb9b3c-bf53-4959-a2af-96b52427d6e2\n\n\nThis is `ng serve` with `\"ssr\": true`, but deployed versions behave the same.\n\nFull app config:\n```ts\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n  providers: [\n    provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection(),\n    provideRouter(appRoutes,\n      withComponentInputBinding(),\n

This means, the app developer can determine the change detection strategy himself.\n\nMy library component can host the content of the app developer in form of content projection or by providing a template. In both cases, the information has to be provided by the app developer, in a context he has control of. The template and/or projected content will be parsed by angular in the context it was \"written in\" by the app developer. \n\nImagine the following situation: \n\nComponent A `Default`, our root component.\nComponent B `Default`, a component that relies on zone.js for change detection\nComponent C `OnPush`, projects content or prints a template.\n\nComponent A.html:\n`\n<component-c> \n  <ng-template #template>\n    <component-b></component-b>\n  </ng-template>\n  <component-b></component-b>\n</component-c>\n`\n\nThis will work as long as Component A is set to `Default`.\n\nSee https://github.com/fl-mueller/zonelessTest/tree/angular-issue-showcase\n\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58648","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missleading zoneless documentation\" (#58648)"},{"Id":"2657530790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-14T04:34:55","Actor":"sheikalthaf","Number":"58646","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(docs-infra): migrate adev to signal-based queries","State":"open","Body":"Used migration schametic to migrate to signal based queries and little manual migration where setter is used\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The esbuild configuration pre-configured the builder with the angular-devkit/build-angular:application option. If I run ng serve with this configuration the microfrontend works, but unfortunately I would need the browser-esbuild option and this is where the problem arises.\nSo by configuring angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild and changing the key from options.browser to options.main and then starting ng serve I get the error:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'browser'.\n\nChanging again from options.main to options.browser (not noticing that it warns you by saying: the browser property is not allowed.) and running ng serve again gives me:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'main'.\n\nAnother test I performed is deleting the options.main/options.browser key and running ng serve again gives me the error:\n\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\nData path \"\" must have required property 'main'.\n\nEven initializing the microfrontend with --type remote gives the same problem\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nreproducing this error is simple: \n- make a new app\n- install @angular-architects/native-federation library (my version is 18.2.2)\n- initialize the microfrontend with ng g @angular-architects/native-federation:init --type host\n- change in angular.json file architect.esbuild.builder: \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\"\n- change from options.browser to options.main\n- ng serve\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError: Schema validation failed with the following errors:\n  Data path \"\" must have required property 'browser'.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.11\nNode: 22.0.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.11\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.11\n@schematics/angular             18.2.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28837","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Use angular native federation with builder configuration: \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\"\" (#28837)"},{"Id":"2648281070","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-11T06:11:57","Actor":"SanderElias","Number":"28834","RawContent":null,"Title":"`ng update` breaks on \"private\" packages","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nupdate\n\n### Description\n\nI'm unsure if this is a regression.

This is especially noticeable when the asynchronous action involves some kind of XHR.\n\nLooking a bit further into it, I noticed that synchronous `getChildren` calls have also regressed in 18.2.0: there are now a lot more calls to this method than in cdk/material 18.1.5.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n18.2.X:\n\nStackBlitz link: [StackBlitz 18.2.X](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-acc226?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

This is sometimes used in\r\ncomplex expressions, where the resulting value is captured in a\r\ncontext variable. There's two syntax forms available:\r\n\r\n1. Binding to `NgIfContext.ngIf` using the `as` syntax:\r\n```html\r\n<span *ngIf=\"enabled && user as u\">{{u.name}}</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

Both create an instance of their own component which both contain a `TestComponent`. In `one.spec.ts` I replace `TestComponent` with a Mock using `overrideModule`. If `one.spec.ts` is executed first by the test runner, `two.spec.ts` also uses the Mock component.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this example also does not work if `two.spec.ts` is executed first. In that case the `overrideModule`-call seems to be ignored.\r\n\r\nI cannot say for sure wether this is a problem with Angular or Karma. If you think I should open an issue on Karma, please let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nhttps://github.com/kalsowerus/repro-app\r\n\r\nThe `TestComponent` I mentioned earlier prints `'test'` in its `ngOnInit()`, while the mock component inside `one.spec.ts` prints `'mock'`. To see the problem just `npm install` and then `ng test`. The exact command I used to execute the tests is `ng test --browsers ChromeForWSL --watch=false`. `ChromeForWSL` being a custom Launcher based on Chrome which disables the \"VizDisplayCompositor\"-feature since that does not seem to work in a WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) environment.\r\n\r\nThe expected result would be seeing both `'test'` and `'mock'` in the console once in any order. But depending on the execution order either of them are printed twice while the other one is not printed at all.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNo exception or error\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.1\r\nNode: 12.14.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Specifically, when both \"full checking\" or \"full+strict checking\" is enabled, the compiler errors out on valid code as if the type of the iteration variable was not inferred (see the error in the section below).\r\n\r\nConversely, when only doing \"strict checking\" (without \"full checking\") the compiler accepts invalid code, which seems to contradict the docs: \r\n\r\n> Strict mode is a superset of full mode, and is accessed by setting the strictTemplates flag to true. This flag supersedes the fullTemplateTypeCheck flag. In strict mode, Angular version 9 adds checks that go beyond the version 8 type-checker.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\nI have been unable to tweak the compiler settings on stackblitz, so I created a repo containg the reproduction.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ranma42/strict-ngfor/commits/master\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>ERROR in src/app/app.component.html:3:31 - error TS7053: Element\r\nimplicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'any' can't be\r\nused to index type '{ x: string; }'.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 9.1.1\r\nNode: 12.16.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

This will load the child again that returns its parent's routes and so on.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nLazy loaded modules without `RouterModule.forChild()` won't break the app.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that this might throw an exception telling me that I'm lazy loading a module that doesn't define any routes but maybe it is a valid use-case (for example I'm loading a module that only does some logic in its constructor).\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI only changed one line and added one test that would fail with `Error: 1 timer(s) still in the queue.` without this change:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/compare/master...martinsik:issue-29164?expand=1#diff-2a29f955e9e56e86ee957a9768a19929R44\r\n\r\nAll other changes were made by running `yarn gulp format`\r\n\r\nCloses #29164","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36605","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): lazy loaded modules without RouterModule.forChild() won't cause infinite loop\" (#36605)"},{"Id":"598717575","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-13T07:08:42","Actor":"afeef1915","Number":"36603","RawContent":null,"Title":"FormControlName not working with Checkboxes Angular 9","State":"open","Body":"This code was working Angular 8.2\r\n\r\nBut didn't work Angular 9\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<input [id]=\"field.code\" [name]=\"field.code\" [formControlName]=\"field.code\"\r\n\t\t\tclass=\"form-check-input custom-control-input\" type=\"checkbox\"\r\n\t\t\tvalue=\"field.checkbox_values.checked.code\" (change)=\"onChange($event)\"\r\n\t\t\t[checked]=\"this.field.checkbox_values.checked.code === this.field.value ?

All that was added was a `cdkDragPreview` with the `matchSize` input property.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div cdkDropList cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" class=\"example-list\" (cdkDropListDropped)=\"drop($event)\">\r\n  <div class=\"example-box\" *ngFor=\"let timePeriod of timePeriods\" cdkDrag>\r\n    {{timePeriod}}\r\n    <ng-template cdkDragPreview matchSize>\r\n      <div class=\"example-box\">\r\n        {{timePeriod}}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </ng-template>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n(In this case, the preview element is basically the same thing as the cdkDrag element, which doesn't make too much sense, but it is just for demonstration purposes and could contain different elements/styles)\r\n\r\nUpon dragging an item, the preview does not match the same size as the original item/placeholder.\r\n\r\n![GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23387905/79091382-15b51780-7d1b-11ea-93e4-95d60cf8e712.gif)\r\n_(Notice the \"Bronze Age\" preview is not as wide causing text wrap)_\r\n\r\nThe cause of this problem is the flexbox droplist container (where the items grow/shrink to fill the available space) combined with how the preview element is created.\r\n\r\nThe preview template is currently being stamped out in the `cdkDrag` injected view container.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprivate _createPreviewElement(): HTMLElement {\r\n    const previewConfig = this._previewTemplate;\r\n    const previewClass = this.previewClass;\r\n    const previewTemplate = previewConfig ? previewConfig.template : null;\r\n    let preview: HTMLElement;\r\n\r\n    if (previewTemplate) {\r\n      // <-- HERE -->\r\n      const viewRef = previewConfig!.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(previewTemplate,\r\n                                                                       previewConfig!.context);\r\n      viewRef.detectChanges();\r\n      preview = getRootNode(viewRef, this._document);\r\n      this._previewRef = viewRef;\r\n\r\n      if (previewConfig!.matchSize) {\r\n        matchElementSize(preview, this._rootElement);\r\n      } else {\r\n        //...\r\n      }\r\n    } else {\r\n      //...\r\n    }\r\n//...\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nIf you put a breakpoint immediately after the `viewRef.detectChanges()` line, you will see the preview becoming another item in the list, as creating and inserting the embedded view in the view container essentially just tacks on another sibling.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23387905/79090580-24e69600-7d18-11ea-820c-55b5a079c375.png)\r\n_(\"Bronze Age\" was started to be dragged)_\r\n\r\nSince the preview item is added as a sibling, flexbox recalculates the width of all the items. The `matchSize` functionality is then executed with these modified (smaller, in this case) dimensions.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nIs a view container even necessary here?\r\nChanging the above code to the following appears to work just fine.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n if (previewTemplate) {\r\n      // <-- HERE -->\r\n      //const viewRef = previewConfig!.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(previewTemplate,\r\n      //                                                                 previewConfig!.context);\r\n      const viewRef = previewTemplate.createEmbeddedView(previewConfig!.context);\r\n      viewRef.detectChanges();\r\n```\r\nThis creates the same drag preview `viewRef`, except it is not immediately attached to the DOM.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction link contains some copied source code to preview this change - just need to comment/uncomment those lines.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the dragged item could be measured before the preview is created. But if there is no reason to use a view container, the above change seems like the more optimal approach.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-twksuh?file=src/app/cdk-drag-drop-horizontal-sorting-example.html)\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPreview to match size.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nPreview does not match size.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 9.2\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19060","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(drag-drop): cdkDragPreview matchSize does not always match size due to view container insertion\" (#19060)"},{"Id":"598631632","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-13T02:28:46","Actor":"ngohungphuc","Number":"19059","RawContent":null,"Title":"help([CDK]): [enter is deprecated: No longer being used.

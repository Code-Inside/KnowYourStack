This would otherwise cause problems with assignability of types.\r\n\r\nIt also nicely integrates into our existing rollup configuration, and overall simplifies the `ng_package` rule even further!\r\n\r\nNotably `tsup` also uses this rollup plugin, and it seems to work well. Keep in mind that Microsoft's API extractor is pretty hard to integrate, caused many problems in the past, and isn't capable of code splitting.

The settings should use camelCase [#&#8203;9211](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9211).\n\n    `pnpm-workspace.yaml` example:\n\n    ```yaml\n    verifyDepsBeforeRun: install\n    optimisticRepeatInstall: true\n    publicHoistPattern:\n      - \"*types*\"\n      - \"!@&#8203;types/react\"\n    ```\n\n-   Projects using a `file:` dependency on a local tarball file (i.e. `.tgz`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar`) will see a performance improvement during installation. Previously, using a `file:` dependency on a tarball caused the lockfile resolution step to always run. The lockfile will now be considered up-to-date if the tarball is unchanged.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   `pnpm self-update` should not leave a directory with a broken pnpm installation if the installation fails.\n-   `fast-glob` replace with `tinyglobby` to reduce the size of the pnpm CLI dependencies [#&#8203;9169](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9169).\n-   `pnpm deploy` should not remove fields from the deployed package's `package.json` file [#&#8203;9215](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9215).\n-   `pnpm self-update` should not read the pnpm settings from the `package.json` file in the current working directory.\n-   Fix `pnpm deploy` creating a `package.json` without the `imports` and `license` field [#&#8203;9193](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9193).\n-   `pnpm update -i` should list only packages that have newer versions [#&#8203;9206](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9206).\n-   Fix a bug causing entries in the `catalogs` section of the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to be removed when `dedupe-peer-dependents=false` on a filtered install.

Use the `sync-injected-deps-after-scripts` setting to specify which scripts build the workspace package. This tells pnpm when syncing is needed. The setting should be defined in a `.npmrc` file at the root of the workspace. Example:\n\n    ```ini\n    sync-injected-deps-after-scripts[]=compile\n    ```\n\n-   The `packages` field in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` became optional.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   `pnpm link` with no parameters should work as if `--global` is specified [#&#8203;9151](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9151).\n-   Allow scope registry CLI option without `--config.` prefix such as `--@&#8203;scope:registry=https://scope.example.com/npm` [#&#8203;9089](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9089).\n-   `pnpm link <path>` should calculate relative path from the root of the workspace directory [#&#8203;9132](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9132).\n-   Fix a bug causing catalog snapshots to be removed from the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file when using `--fix-lockfile` and `--filter`. [#&#8203;8639](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8639)\n-   Fix a bug causing catalog protocol dependencies to not re-resolve on a filtered install [#&#8203;8638](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8638).\n\n### [`v10.4.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1041)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.4.0...v10.4.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   Throws an error when the value provided by the `--allow-build` option overlaps with the `pnpm.ignoredBuildDependencies` list [#&#8203;9105](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9105).\n-   Print pnpm's version after the execution time at the end of the console output.\n-   Print warning about ignored builds of dependencies on repeat install [#&#8203;9106](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9106).\n-   Setting `init-package-manager` should work.\n\n### [`v10.4.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1040)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.3.0...v10.4.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n-   `pnpm approve-builds --global` works now for allowing dependencies of globally installed packages to run postinstall scripts.\n\n-   The `pnpm add` command now supports a new flag, `--allow-build`, which allows building the specified dependencies. For instance, if you want to install a package called `bundle` that has `esbuild` as a dependency and want to allow `esbuild` to run postinstall scripts, you can run:\n\n        pnpm --allow-build=esbuild add bundle\n\n    This will run `esbuild`'s postinstall script and also add it to the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` field of `package.json`. So, `esbuild` will always be allowed to run its scripts in the future.\n\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;9086](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9086).\n\n-   The `pnpm init` command adds a `packageManager` field with the current version of pnpm CLI [#&#8203;9069](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9069). To disable this behaviour, set the `init-package-manager` setting to `false`.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   `pnpm approve-builds` should work after two consecutive `pnpm install` runs [#&#8203;9083](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9083).\n-   Fix instruction for updating pnpm with corepack [#&#8203;9101](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9101).\n-   The pnpm version specified by `packageManager` cannot start with `v`.\n\n### [`v10.3.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1030)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.2.1...v10.3.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n-   Added a new setting called `strict-dep-builds`. When enabled, the installation will exit with a non-zero exit code if any dependencies have unreviewed build scripts (aka postinstall scripts) [#&#8203;9071](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9071).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   Fix a false negative of `verify-deps-before-run` after `pnpm install --production|--no-optional` [#&#8203;9019](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9019).\n-   Print the warning about blocked installation scripts at the end of the installation output and make it more prominent.\n\n### [`v10.2.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1021)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.2.0...v10.2.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   Don't read a package from side-effects cache if it isn't allowed to be built [#&#8203;9042](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9042).\n-   `pnpm approve-builds` should work, when executed from a subdirectory of a workspace [#&#8203;9042](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9042).\n-   `pnpm deploy --legacy` should work without injected dependencies.\n-   Add information about how to deploy without \"injected dependencies\" to the \"pnpm deploy\" error message.\n\n### [`v10.2.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1020)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.1.0...v10.2.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n-   Packages executed via `pnpm dlx` and `pnpm create` are allowed to be built (run postinstall scripts) by default.\n\n    If the packages executed by `dlx` or `create` have dependencies that have to be built, they should be listed via the `--allow-build` flag. For instance, if you want to run a package called `bundle` that has `esbuild` in dependencies and want to allow `esbuild` to run postinstall scripts, run:\n\n        pnpm --allow-build=esbuild dlx bundle\n\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;9026](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9026).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   Quote args for scripts with shell-quote to support new lines (on POSIX only) [#&#8203;8980](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8980).\n-   Fix a bug in which `pnpm deploy` fails to read the correct `projectId` when the deploy source is the same as the workspace directory [#&#8203;9001](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9001).\n-   Proxy settings should be respected, when resolving Git-hosted dependencies [#&#8203;6530](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/6530).\n-   Prevent `overrides` from adding invalid version ranges to `peerDependencies` by keeping the `peerDependencies` and overriding them with prod `dependencies` [#&#8203;8978](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8978).\n-   Sort the package names in the \"pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies\" list saved by `pnpm approve-builds`.\n\n### [`v10.1.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1010)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.0.0...v10.1.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n-   Added a new command for printing the list of dependencies with ignored build scripts: `pnpm ignored-builds` [#&#8203;8963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8963).\n-   Added a new command for approving dependencies for running scripts during installation: `pnpm approve-builds` [#&#8203;8963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8963).\n-   Added a new setting called `optimistic-repeat-install`. When enabled, a fast check will be performed before proceeding to installation. This way a repeat install or an install on a project with everything up-to-date becomes a lot faster. But some edge cases might arise, so we keep it disabled by default for now [#&#8203;8977](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8977).\n-   Added a new field \"pnpm.ignoredBuiltDependencies\" for explicitly listing packages that should not be built. When a package is in the list, pnpm will not print an info message about that package not being built [#&#8203;8935](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8935).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   Verify that the package name is valid when executing the publish command.\n-   When running `pnpm install`, the `preprepare` and `postprepare` scripts of the project should be executed [#&#8203;8989](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8989).\n-   Allow `workspace:` and `catalog:` to be part of wider version range in `peerDependencies`.\n-   `pnpm deploy` should inherit the `pnpm` object from the root `package.json` [#&#8203;8991](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8991).\n-   Make sure that the deletion of a `node_modules` in a sub-project of a monorepo is detected as out-of-date [#&#8203;8959](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8959).\n-   Fix infinite loop caused by lifecycle scripts using `pnpm` to execute other scripts during `pnpm install` with `verify-deps-before-run=install` [#&#8203;8954](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8954).\n-   Replace `strip-ansi` with the built-in `util.stripVTControlCharacters` [#&#8203;9009](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9009).\n-   Do not print patched dependencies as ignored dependencies that require a build [#&#8203;8952](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8952).\n\n### [`v10.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1000)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.15.9...v10.0.0)\n\n##### Major Changes\n\n-   Lifecycle scripts of dependencies are not executed during installation by default! This is a breaking change aimed at increasing security. In order to allow lifecycle scripts of specific dependencies, they should be listed in the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` field of `package.json` [#&#8203;8897](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8897). For example:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"pnpm\": {\n        \"onlyBuiltDependencies\": [\"fsevents\"]\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   `pnpm link` behavior updated:\n\n    The `pnpm link` command now adds overrides to the root `package.json`.\n\n    -   In a workspace: The override is added to the root of the workspace, linking the dependency to all projects in the workspace.\n    -   Global linking: To link a package globally, run `pnpm link` from the package’s directory. Previously, you needed to use `pnpm link -g`.\n        Related PR: [#&#8203;8653](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8653)\n\n-   Secure hashing with SHA256:\n\n    Various hashing algorithms have been updated to SHA256 for enhanced security and consistency:\n\n    -   Long paths inside `node_modules/.pnpm` are now hashed with SHA256.\n    -   Long peer dependency hashes in the lockfile now use SHA256 instead of MD5. (This affects very few users since these are only used for long keys.)\n    -   The hash stored in the `packageExtensionsChecksum` field of `pnpm-lock.yaml` is now SHA256.\n    -   The side effects cache keys now use SHA256.\n    -   The pnpmfile checksum in the lockfile now uses SHA256 ([#&#8203;8530](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8530)).\n\n-   Configuration updates:\n\n    -   `manage-package-manager-versions`: enabled by default. pnpm now manages its own version based on the `packageManager` field in `package.json` by default.\n\n    -   `public-hoist-pattern`: nothing is hoisted by default. Packages containing `eslint` or `prettier` in their name are no longer hoisted to the root of `node_modules`. Related Issue: [#&#8203;8378](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8378)\n\n    -   Upgraded `@yarnpkg/extensions` to v2.0.3. This may alter your lockfile.\n\n    -   `virtual-store-dir-max-length`: the default value on Windows has been reduced to 60 characters.\n\n    -   Reduced environment variables for scripts:\n        During script execution, fewer `npm_package_*` environment variables are set. Only `name`, `version`, `bin`, `engines`, and `config` remain.\n        Related Issue: [#&#8203;8552](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8552)\n\n    -   All dependencies are now installed even if `NODE_ENV=production`. Related Issue: [#&#8203;8827](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8827)\n\n-   Changes to the global store:\n\n    -   Store version bumped to v10.\n\n    -   Some registries allow identical content to be published under different package names or versions. To accommodate this, index files in the store are now stored using both the content hash and package identifier.\n\n        This approach ensures that we can:\n\n        1.  Validate that the integrity in the lockfile corresponds to the correct package, which might not be the case after a poorly resolved Git conflict.\n        2.  Allow the same content to be referenced by different packages or different versions of the same package.\n            Related PR: [#&#8203;8510](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8510)\n            Related Issue: [#&#8203;8204](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8204)\n\n    -   More efficient side effects indexing. The structure of index files in the store has changed. Side effects are now tracked more efficiently by listing only file differences rather than all files.\n        Related PR: [#&#8203;8636](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8636)\n\n    -   A new `index` directory stores package content mappings. Previously, these files were in `files`.\n\n-   Other breaking changes:\n    -   The `#` character is now escaped in directory names within `node_modules/.pnpm`.\n        Related PR: [#&#8203;8557](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8557)\n    -   Running `pnpm add --global pnpm` or `pnpm add --global @&#8203;pnpm/exe` now fails with an error message, directing you to use `pnpm self-update` instead.\n        Related PR: [#&#8203;8728](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8728)\n    -   Dependencies added via a URL now record the final resolved URL in the lockfile, ensuring that any redirects are fully captured.\n        Related Issue: [#&#8203;8833](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8833)\n    -   The `pnpm deploy` command now only works in workspaces that have `inject-workspace-packages=true`. This limitation is introduced to allow us to create a proper lockfile for the deployed project using the workspace lockfile.\n    -   Removed conversion from lockfile v6 to v9. If you need v6-to-v9 conversion, use pnpm CLI v9.\n    -   `pnpm test` now passes all parameters after the `test` keyword directly to the underlying script. This matches the behavior of `pnpm run test`. Previously you needed to use the `--` prefix.\n        Related PR: [#&#8203;8619](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8619)\n\n-   `node-gyp` updated to version 11.\n\n-   `pnpm deploy` now tries creating a dedicated lockfile from a shared lockfile for deployment. It will fallback to deployment without a lockfile if there is no shared lockfile or `force-legacy-deploy` is set to `true`.\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n-   Added support for a new type of dependencies called \"configurational dependencies\". These dependencies are installed before all the other types of dependencies (before \"dependencies\", \"devDependencies\", \"optionalDependencies\").\n\n    Configurational dependencies cannot have dependencies of their own or lifecycle scripts. They should be added using exact version and the integrity checksum. Example:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"pnpm\": {\n        \"configDependencies\": {\n          \"my-configs\": \"1.0.0+sha512-30iZtAPgz+LTIYoeivqYo853f02jBYSd5uGnGpkFV0M3xOt9aN73erkgYAmZU43x4VfqcnLxW9Kpg3R5LC4YYw==\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Related RFC: [#&#8203;8](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/rfcs/pull/8).\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8915](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8915).\n\n-   New settings:\n\n    -   New `verify-deps-before-run` setting. This setting controls how `pnpm` checks `node_modules` before running scripts:\n\n        -   `install`: Automatically run `pnpm install` if `node_modules` is outdated.\n        -   `warn`: Print a warning if `node_modules` is outdated.\n        -   `prompt`: Prompt the user to confirm running `pnpm install` if `node_modules` is outdated.\n        -   `error`: Throw an error if `node_modules` is outdated.\n        -   `false`: Disable dependency checks.\n            Related Issue: [#&#8203;8585](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8585)\n\n    -   New `inject-workspace-packages` setting enables hard-linking all local workspace dependencies instead of symlinking them. Previously, this could be achieved using [`dependenciesMeta[].injected`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#dependenciesmetainjected), which remains supported.\n        Related PR: [#&#8203;8836](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8836)\n\n-   Faster repeat installs:\n\n    On repeated installs, `pnpm` performs a quick check to ensure `node_modules` is up to date.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8838](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8838)\n\n-   `pnpm add` integrates with default workspace catalog:\n\n    When adding a dependency, `pnpm add` checks the default workspace catalog. If the dependency and version requirement match the catalog, `pnpm add` uses the `catalog:` protocol. Without a specified version, it matches the catalog’s version. If it doesn’t match, it falls back to standard behavior.\n    Related Issue: [#&#8203;8640](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8640)\n\n-   `pnpm dlx` now resolves packages to their exact versions and uses these exact versions for cache keys. This ensures `pnpm dlx` always installs the latest requested packages.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8811](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8811)\n\n-   No `node_modules` validation on certain commands. Commands that should not modify `node_modules` (e.g., `pnpm install --lockfile-only`) no longer validate or purge `node_modules`.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8657](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8657)\n\n### [`v9.15.9`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.15.9): pnpm 9.15.9\n\n[Compare

Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.15.6...v9.15.7)\n\n#### Patch Changes\n\n-   `pnpm self-update` should not leave a directory with a broken pnpm installation if the installation fails.\n-   Allow scope registry CLI option without `--config.` prefix such as `--@&#8203;scope:registry=https://scope.example.com/npm` [#&#8203;9089](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9089).\n-   `pnpm self-update` should not read the pnpm settings from the `package.json` file in the current working directory.\n-   `pnpm update -i` should list only packages that have newer versions [#&#8203;9206](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9206).\n-   Fix a bug causing entries in the `catalogs` section of the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to be removed when `dedupe-peer-dependents=false` on a filtered install.

Notice these colors match which means they would blend together.\n\n```\n@media (prefers-contrast: more) {\n    --mat-sys-tertiary: light-dark(#56004f, #ffeaf6);\n    --mat-sys-on-tertiary: light-dark(#56004f, #ffeaf6);\n}\n````\n\nI tracked this down to [this section of the schematic](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/1b721a03faca95636d202660167ff35c2399bdfb/src/material/schematics/ng-generate/theme-color/index.ts#L533): \n\n\n```\n  css += createLightDarkVar(\n    leftSpacing,\n    'on-tertiary',\n    isHighContrast ? lightScheme.tertiary : lightScheme.tertiaryPalette.tone(100),\n    isHighContrast ? darkScheme.tertiary : darkScheme.tertiaryPalette.tone(20),\n  );\n```\n\n\nI believe that `lightScheme.onTertiary` and `darkScheme.onTertiary` should be used here?  However I am honestly out of my depth. \n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. run `ng generate @angular/material:theme-color`\n2.

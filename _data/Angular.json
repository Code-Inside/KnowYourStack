Often, developers map observables to fields within a mapping and then name that mapping. This leads to blocks that look like the following:\r\n```\r\n<div *ngIf=\"{ \r\n    a: aObservable$ | async,\r\n    b: bObservable$ | async,\r\n    c: cObservable$ | async\r\n} as obs\">\r\n  <p>{{ obs.a }}</p>\r\n  <p>{{ obs.b }}</p>\r\n  <p>{{ obs.c }}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nThere is an annoying bug with this code though. When one of the observables within the mapping returns a value, the result is defined, therefore the entire NgIf results to `true` (since an object is truthy). This causes race conditions and cases where the nested html is rendered with null fields instead of the expected emitted values.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to fix this issue is to break it into multiple async calls:\r\n```\r\n<div *ngIf=\"aObservable$ | async as a\">\r\n  <div *ngIf=\"bObservable$ | async as b\">\r\n    <div *ngIf=\"cObservable$ | async as c\">\r\n      <p>{{ a }}</p>\r\n      <p>{{ b }}</p>\r\n      <p>{{ c }}</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nThis leads to deep nesting though and is cumbersome to write and consume.\r\n\r\nWithin our codebase I have implemented the proposed solution and was wondering if others were open to me contributing it to @angular/common pipes.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI implemented the `multiasync` pipe. It works just like the `async` pipe but operates on a mapping to observables instead of a singular observable value.\r\n```\r\n<div *ngIf=\"{ \r\n    a: aObservable$,\r\n    b: bObservable$,\r\n    c: cObservable$\r\n} | multiasync as obs\">\r\n  <p>{{ obs.a }}</p>\r\n  <p>{{ obs.b }}</p>\r\n  <p>{{ obs.c }}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInternally, `multiasync`is similar to async but instead of a singular subscription it is subscribing to all the member observables using `combineLatest`. This results in a value once all the observables emit. It will also re-render the inner html when any of observables update after that initial emit.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI tried to implement this with multiple async pipes but nothing worked as intended or was ugly to write and hard to use. I think the above pattern is fairly common (I could be wrong), and if so, this might be a nice ergonomic addition to angular's pipes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55693","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Async Pipe for map of Observables\" (#55693)"},{"Id":"2281859989","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-06T22:02:13","Actor":"tbondwilkinson","Number":"55695","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Remove custom event and replay behavior.","State":"open","Body":"These behaviors have been moved back to g3.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

computed with write operations","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nRevival with use case of #50498\r\n\r\nCurrently `signal` produces a writable signal.\r\nCurrently `computed` produces a non writable signal.\r\nWhat I am missing is a `writableComputed`.\r\n\r\nUse case example:\r\nI have a required input called `value` but inside the component I can edit this value without affecting the outside. At the end an apply button is clicked and I emit the new value via an output.\r\nSomething like this:\r\n```ts\r\nclass Test {\r\n  value = input.required<string>();\r\n  tempValue = signal(/*??*/);\r\n  commit = output<string>()\r\n\r\n  onEdit(newValue: string) {\r\n    this.tempValue.set(newValue);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  onApply() {\r\n    this.commit.emit(this.tempValue());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThe first problem is `tempValue` isn't based on `value`.\r\nThe second problem is when `value` is changed from outside. At this point I wish to discard  `tempValue` and start fresh with the new `value`.\r\nIf I had `writableComputed` I could do:\r\n```ts\r\ntempValue = writableComputed(() => this.value());\r\n```\r\nWhich means anytime `value` changes it becomes the new `tempValue` value. If `tempValue` is edited the new edit is the `tempValue` new value until something gets changed in `value`.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA new `writableComputed` which tracks the value inside based on the writeable part and will get reset each time the computed function runs to what it creates.\r\nExamples:\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = signal(7);\r\nconst b = writableComputed(() => a() + 1);\r\n// b is 8\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = signal(7);\r\nconst b = writableComputed(() => a() + 1);\r\nb.set(9);\r\n// A design question - 8 or 9\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = signal(7);\r\nconst b = writableComputed(() => a() + 1);\r\na.set(11);\r\nb.set(9);\r\n// A design question - 12 or 9\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = signal(7);\r\nconst b = writableComputed(() => a() + 1);\r\n// b is 8\r\n// Later\r\nb.set(10)\r\n// b is 10\r\n// Later\r\na.set(20);\r\n// b is 21\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing effect. The downside is with required inputs.\r\n```ts\r\ntempValue = signal<string | undefined>(undefined);\r\neffect(() => this.tempValue.set(this.value()), {allowSignalWrites: true});\r\n```\r\nThis will result in `tempValue` having `undefined` initially and for example in `ngOnInit` it will still have `undefined` although `value` already have the actual value set. Also a computed will have its value set too.\r\nusing `writableComputed` in `ngOnInit` will have the correct computed value.\r\n\r\nAnother option is that scenario hints that something I am doing is wrong from the basis and I would like to hear better suggestions how to handle it.

I accidentally ran into some of these limits. I had to grab a calculator, the build output, make some assumptions, run some calculations, before I could actually understand what these options meant.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if these were unambiguous.\r\n\r\nThe generated project limits rules-as-written are:\r\n\r\n- Initial maximum warning: 500 kilobits\r\n- Initial maximum error: 1millibit\r\n- Any component style maximum warning: 2 kilobits\r\n- Any component style maximum error: 6 kilobits\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let's assume that the the `m` in `mb` should be `M`, that's a factor 10⁹ difference, but ¹/₁₀₀₀ bits makes no sense here, since we're talking about real storage here. I've only ever used millibits in calculations on pure information.\r\n\r\nI analysed this output:\r\n\r\n> Budget 500.00 kB was not met by 589.00 kB with a total of 1.06 MB\r\n\r\nThis quickly points in the direction that the `b` should be a `B`, it's bytes, not bits.\r\nFinally if I run some calculations on this, it clears up another thing (but the output is faulty here too).\r\n\r\n(500 + 589)×10³ ≠ 1.06 × 10⁶ (rules-as-written ISO prefixes)\r\n(500 + 589)×2¹⁰ ≠ 1.06 × 10³ × 2¹⁰ (floppy disk megabytes)\r\n(500 + 589)×2¹⁰ = 1.06 × 10²⁰ (actually intended ISO/IEC 80000-13 binary prefix standard)\r\n\r\nFrom this I can conclude that the numbers used in calculations are actually using the binary measures according to ISO/IEC 80000 (which is the most common for modern systems AFAIK), and the `k` should be `ki` and the `m` should ultimately be `Mi`.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it's no trivial matter to understand what the configuration file actually means with these values:\r\n\r\n- Initial maximum warning: 500 kiB (kibibytes) or 500 × 10¹⁰ bytes = 512000 bytes\r\n- Initial maximum error: 1 MiB (mebibyte) or 1 × 10²⁰ bytes = 1048576 bytes\r\n- Any component style maximum warning: 2 kiB or 2 × 10¹⁰ bytes = 2048 bytes\r\n- Any component style maximum error: 6 kiB or 6 × 10¹⁰ bytes = 6144 bytes\r\n\r\nNote that you now suddenly can see that the initial maximum _warning_ is **not** half of the initial maximum _error_ but is approximately 48.8% of the maximum error.\r\n\r\nWhile not a big priority, as it is unlikely to cause problems whose solution isn't obvious (increase the limits), it is annoying as it can unexpectedly cause errors whose exact cause is hard to understand.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n`ng g new app`\r\nCheck `angular.json` » project » app » architect » build » configuration » production » budgets\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.6\r\nNode: 22.0.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1703.6 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          17.3.6 (cli-only)\r\n    \r\nWarning: The current version of Node (22.0.0) is not supported by Angular.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27580","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Confusing project budgets\" (#27580)"},{"Id":"2280924031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-06T14:03:25","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27602","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): format sizes using decimal byte units consistently","State":"closed","Body":"Ensure that file sizes are consistently formatted using decimal byte units, adhering to the International System of Units (SI) convention.

The new CLI `@tailwindcss/cli` traverses files in your project and automatically finds the tailwind classes. It works without a tailwind config, which is what the angular builder looks for to support tailwind. The problem is, you have to setup an npm script to invoke the tailwind CLI, and it is seemingly impossible to integrate it into Angular's build process. I've tried lots of weird hacky things.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Tailwind v4 offers a new [postcss plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha#using-post-css), but again, there is no way to configure post css in Angular.\r\n\r\nOther issues with using Tailwind v4 in an Angular project:\r\n- `@angular-devkit/build-angular` (v16 and v17) has a peer dependency of `\"tailwindcss\": \"^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0\",`\r\n- Tailwind support is currently [baked into the builder](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/styles.ts#L78), making it impossible to support new major versions of tailwind. \r\n\r\nWe ought to be able to use the latest and greatest in our Angular projects. As a start we should remove the peer dependency on old versions of tailwind. \r\n\r\nWe ought to decouple tailwind integration out of this package so it can be configurable by devs.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have an angular 16 project [here](https://github.com/jamie-perkins-sp/angular16-test) with tailwind v4 installed, you have to use the `--force` flag to install dependencies because of the incompatible tailwind peer dep. An npm script \"tailwind\"  has to be run separately from the build, so for every style change you have to rerun the command.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nv16 and v17\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27585","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Supporting Tailwind v4\" (#27585)"},{"Id":"2276093089","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T17:28:17","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27583","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.1 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27583","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.1 release\" (#27583)"},{"Id":"2276078974","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T17:23:28","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27582","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27582","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.1\" with changelog.\" (#27582)"},{"Id":"2275772137","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-02T16:21:58","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27581","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): only generate shallow preload links for initial files","State":"closed","Body":"To remove the potential for a large amount of modulepreload link elements being added to the generating `index.html` for an application, the number of elements is now limited to five.

This behavior limits dynamic interaction capabilities, such as updating marker styles in real-time based on user interactions or data changes.\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis feature would allow developers to dynamically change the properties of markers on a map based on real-time data or user interactions. For example, changing the color or icon of a marker to reflect it's status (e.g., available, busy, or inactive) without needing to remove and re-add the marker to the map.

PostgreSQL uses multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) to ensure consistency between simultaneous transactions. This means each transaction may see different rows -- and different numbers of rows -- in a table. There is no single universal row count that the database could cache, so it must scan through all rows counting how many are visible.

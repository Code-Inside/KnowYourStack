Reading the tutorial for the new angular.dev path, in the [Property Binding](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/property-binding) section, I saw the following code.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  styleUrls: ['app.component.css'],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div [contentEditable]=\"isEditable\"></div>\r\n  `,\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  isEditable = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nTo make it easier, I suggest a shortened form when the element's attribute matches the class property name:\r\n\r\nThe code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  styleUrls: ['app.component.css'],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div [contentEditable]></div> // Shorthand property\r\n  `,\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  contentEditable = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWhen the elements repeat with the same attribute, you could do it like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  styleUrls: ['app.component.css'],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div [contentEditable].first></div>\r\n    <div [contentEditable].second></div>\r\n  `,\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  contentEditable = {first: true, second: false}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor the standard mode\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  styleUrls: ['app.component.css'],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div [contentEditable]=\"isEditable\"></div>\r\n    <div [contentEditable]=\"isEditable2\"></div>\r\n  `,\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  isEditable = true;\r\n  isEditable2 = true;\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53109","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Shorthand Property Binding\" (#53109)"},{"Id":"2005366350","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-22T00:40:50","Actor":"csnsw-igor","Number":"53108","RawContent":null,"Title":"Broken link to  Angular's version compatibility","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nClicked on link : [Angular's version compatibility](https://angular.dev/versions) got:\r\n\r\nPage Not Found ðŸ™ƒ\r\nIf you think this is a mistake, please [open an issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/new?template=3-docs-bug.yaml) so we can fix it.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Broken link to  Angular's version compatibility\" (#53108)"},{"Id":"2005324436","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-21T23:47:33","Actor":"anthonychavis","Number":"53107","RawContent":null,"Title":"typo: tutorials/learn-angular/composing-components#add-a-reference-to-usercomponent","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nThere is a typo in the first paragraph, second sentence of https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/composing-components#add-a-reference-to-usercomponent\r\n\r\n- \"Be sure to add `AppComponent` to the imports array of `AppComponent`, this makes it available for use in the `AppComponent` template.\"\r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/composing-components#add-a-reference-to-usercomponent\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\nWas going through the tutorial with the \"Learn Angular in your browser via the Playground\" tutorial.\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- navigate to https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/composing-components#add-a-reference-to-usercomponent\r\n- read the second sentence of this section\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\n- \"Be sure to add `UserComponent` to the imports array of `AppComponent`.

How can I locally work on a project, including hydration, when some components are displayed only for mobile devices and others only for desktop? Previously, I could do this by passing the user-agent to the ngx-device-detector library and obtaining information about the user's device. Unfortunately, currently on localhost I do not have the ability to check what device it is because the REQUEST and RESPONSE have a value of null. As a result, it is difficult to work on the project. How can I deal with this?\r\n\r\n`<div class=\"app\">\r\n  @if (!isMobile) {\r\n  <app-header></app-header>\r\n  }\r\n  @if (isMobile) {\r\n  <app-bottom-navbar></app-bottom-navbar>\r\n  }\r\n</div>\r\n`\r\n\r\nCurrently, on the server side, the isMobile variable will always assume a hardcoded value, e.g. true, until it receives the correct value on the browser side. This causes incompatibility, e.g. in hydration, because the DOM layout on the browser will be different from the server.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53106","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular/ssr - how to handle responsiveness\" (#53106)"},{"Id":"2005292442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-21T23:07:40","Actor":"anthonychavis","Number":"53105","RawContent":null,"Title":"broken url found on tutorials/learn-angular/updating-the-component-class","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nOn page https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/updating-the-component-class, within \"1 Add a property called city\" there is an _anchor element_ wrapping the text \"type inference in TypeScript\" that has an invalid _href_ value.\r\n\r\nWhen clicking \"type inference in TypeScript\" I expected to go to a page containing information about type inference in typescript.

That file is just a re-export (cf code below) and it causes problems for projects trying to use `Node16` as module/moduleResolution option in order to get typescript to understand package exports (#46181).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/c62b2dae8c4653996969df992e8f88887e7c83c4/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/entry_point/src/generator.ts#L30-L35\r\n\r\nThe only benefit that I could find to adding `flatModuleOutFile` is that it triggers the compiler-cli package to check whether everything that is exposed from the package is exported from the package.\r\n\r\nI want to streamline angular library compilation. We've got a proprietary library builder at work, and packages with multiple entry points currently require pretty annoying boilerplate and building is a slow process because every entry point is in its own source folder with its own `(ng-)package.json` file being built by its own typescript program.\r\nUsing `exports` this could be simplified quite a bit. Here's an example of where I'd like to end up:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"some-package\",\r\n  \"exports\": {\r\n    \".\": \"./src/index.ts\",\r\n    \"./sub\": \"./src/sub.ts\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n-> Compiler detects entry points automatically based on the exports, builds the entire package in a single typecript run, generates the FESM files and voilÃ , done.\r\n\r\nI've created a proof-of-concept compiler implementation and plugged it into [a small project](https://github.com/bgotink/ng-lazy) I was working on, in case you're interested. Building this compiler required removing the `flatModuleOutFile` from the typescript config in order to allow multiple rootNames in the project.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSupport the \"is everything that's exposed also exported?\" check if there are multiple rootNames in the typescript project.\r\nRemove the \"use flatModuleOutFile\" prescription in the APF document.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Keep the situation as is\r\n- We could stop using multiple entry points.\r\n  We're actually moving in the opposite direction. We have over 100 packages in our biggest library and we want to scale this down. Entry points are the smallest unit the application javascript can be split at, so we are looking at merging smaller packages into bigger packages with multiple entry points.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53103","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reconsider usefulness of flatModuleOutFile\"

uses import attributes ([#&#8203;3384](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3384))\n\n    JavaScript is gaining new syntax for associating a map of string key-value pairs with individual ESM imports. The proposal is still a work in progress and is still undergoing significant changes before being finalized. However, the first iteration has already been shipping in Chromium-based browsers for a while, and the second iteration has landed in V8 and is now shipping in node, so it makes sense for esbuild to support it. Here are the two major iterations of this proposal (so far):\n\n    1.  Import assertions (deprecated, will not be standardized)\n        -   Uses the `assert` keyword\n        -   Does *not* affect module resolution\n        -   Causes an error if the assertion fails\n        -   Shipping in Chrome 91+ (and in esbuild 0.11.22+)\n\n    2.  Import attributes (currently set to become standardized)\n        -   Uses the `with` keyword\n        -   Affects module resolution\n        -   Unknown attributes cause an error\n        -   Shipping in node 21+\n\n    You can already use esbuild to bundle code that uses import assertions (the first iteration). However, this feature is mostly useless for bundlers because import assertions are not allowed to affect module resolution. It's basically only useful as an annotation on external imports, which esbuild will then preserve in the output for use in a browser (which would otherwise refuse to load certain imports).\n\n    With this release, esbuild now supports bundling code that uses import attributes (the second iteration). This is much more useful for bundlers because they are allowed to affect module resolution, which means the key-value pairs can be provided to plugins. Here's an example, which uses esbuild's built-in support for the upcoming [JSON module standard](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules):\n\n    ```js\n    // On static imports\n    import foo from './package.json' with { type: 'json' }\n    console.log(foo)\n\n    // On dynamic imports\n    const bar = await import('./package.json', { with: { type: 'json' } })\n    console.log(bar)\n    ```\n\n    One important consequence of the change in semantics between import assertions and import attributes is that two imports with identical paths but different import attributes are now considered to be different modules. This is because the import attributes are provided to the loader, which might then use those attributes during loading. For example, you could imagine an image loader that produces an image of a different size depending on the import attributes.\n\n    Import attributes are now reported in the [metafile](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#metafile) and are now provided to [on-load plugins](https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/#on-load) as a map in the `with` property. For example, here's an esbuild plugin that turns all imports with a `type` import attribute equal to `'cheese'` into a module that exports the cheese emoji:\n\n    ```js\n    const cheesePlugin = {\n      name: 'cheese',\n      setup(build) {\n        build.onLoad({ filter: /.*/ }, args => {\n          if (args.with.type === 'cheese') return {\n            contents: `export default \"ðŸ§€\"`,\n          }\n        })\n      }\n    }\n\n    require('esbuild').build({\n      bundle: true,\n      write: false,\n      stdin: {\n        contents: `\n          import foo from 'data:text/javascript,' with { type: 'cheese' }\n          console.log(foo)\n        `,\n      },\n      plugins: [cheesePlugin],\n    }).then(result => {\n      const code = new Function(result.outputFiles[0].text)\n      code()\n    })\n    ```\n\n    Warning: It's possible that the second iteration of this feature may change significantly again even though it's already shipping in real JavaScript VMs (since it has already happened once before). In that case, esbuild may end up adjusting its implementation to match the eventual standard behavior. So keep in mind that by using this, you are using an unstable upcoming JavaScript feature that may undergo breaking changes in the future.\n\n-   Adjust TypeScript experimental decorator behavior ([#&#8203;3230](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3230), [#&#8203;3326](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3326), [#&#8203;3394](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3394))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now allow TypeScript experimental decorators to access both static class properties and `#private` class names. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    const check =\n      <T,>(a: T, b: T): PropertyDecorator =>\n        () => console.log(a === b)\n\n    async function test() {\n      class Foo {\n        static #foo = 1\n        static bar = 1 + Foo.#foo\n        @&#8203;check(Foo.#foo, 1) a: any\n        @&#8203;check(Foo.bar, await Promise.resolve(2)) b: any\n      }\n    }\n\n    test().then(() => console.log('pass'))\n    ```\n\n    This will now print `true true pass` when compiled by esbuild. Previously esbuild evaluated TypeScript decorators outside of the class body, so it didn't allow decorators to access `Foo` or `#foo`. Now esbuild does something different, although it's hard to concisely explain exactly what esbuild is doing now (see the background section below for more information).\n\n    Note that TypeScript's experimental decorator support is currently buggy: TypeScript's compiler passes this test if only the first `@check` is present or if only the second `@check` is present, but TypeScript's compiler fails this test if both checks are present together. I haven't changed esbuild to match TypeScript's behavior exactly here because I'm waiting for TypeScript to fix these bugs instead.\n\n    Some background: TypeScript experimental decorators don't have consistent semantics regarding the context that the decorators are evaluated in. For example, TypeScript will let you use `await` within a decorator, which implies that the decorator runs outside the class body (since `await` isn't supported inside a class body), but TypeScript will also let you use `#private` names, which implies that the decorator runs inside the class body (since `#private` names are only supported inside a class body). The value of `this` in a decorator is also buggy (the run-time value of `this` changes if any decorator in the class uses a `#private` name but the type of `this` doesn't change, leading to the type checker no longer matching reality). These inconsistent semantics make it hard for esbuild to implement this feature as decorator evaluation happens in some superposition of both inside and outside the class body that is particular to the internal implementation details of the TypeScript compiler.\n\n-   Forbid `--keep-names` when targeting old browsers ([#&#8203;3477](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3477))\n\n    The `--keep-names` setting needs to be able to assign to the `name` property on functions and classes. However, before ES6 this property was non-configurable, and attempting to assign to it would throw an error. So with this release, esbuild will no longer allow you to enable this setting while also targeting a really old browser.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.2`](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small502-2023-11-21-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v5.0.1...v5.0.2)\n\n-   fix: make htmlFallback more permissive ([#&#8203;15059](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15059)) ([6fcceeb](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/6fcceeb)), closes [#&#8203;15059](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15059)\n\n### [`v5.0.1`](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small501-2023-11-21-small)\n\n-   test: avoid read check when running as root ([#&#8203;14884](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14884)) ([1d9516c](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/1d9516c)), closes [#&#8203;14884](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14884)\n-   perf(hmr): skip traversed modules when checking circular imports ([#&#8203;15034](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15034)) ([41e437f](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/41e437f)), closes [#&#8203;15034](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15034)\n-   fix: run htmlFallbackMiddleware for no accept header requests ([#&#8203;15025](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15025)) ([b93dfe3](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/b93dfe3)), closes [#&#8203;15025](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15025)\n-   fix: update type CSSModulesOptions interface ([#&#8203;14987](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14987)) ([d0b2153](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/d0b2153)), closes [#&#8203;14987](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14987)\n-   fix(legacy): error in build with --watch and manifest enabled ([#&#8203;14450](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14450)) ([b9ee620](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/b9ee620)), closes [#&#8203;14450](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14450)\n-   chore: add comment about crossorigin attribute for script module ([#&#8203;15040](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15040)) ([03c371e](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/03c371e)), closes [#&#8203;15040](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15040)\n-   chore: cleanup v5 beta changelog ([#&#8203;14694](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14694)) ([531d3cb](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/531d3cb)), closes [#&#8203;14694](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14694)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I see this as an issue in 2 places:\r\n\r\n* `angular.json` does not support conditional setting of values via environment variables. I can't even add comments in a valid JSON.\r\n* Because `ng test --codeCoverage` is a command-line option, I can't use it in `karma.conf.js`. This might be true to whatever replaced Karma recently (Jest by default?). Since I also use the Cypress component test runner, where I also enabled code coverage, an environment variable reused for both tools is more convenient.\r\n\r\nYes I understand that this makes migration scripts much harder to implement if not impossible. But look at how other frameworks work, e.g. Vite.

Even though the animation appears to happen, the callbacks do not get called. When the sort is not applied, this does not ever seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be related to changes to/from `void`, but as best I can tell from the docs, these should still trigger the callbacks.\r\n\r\nI believe this is related to this issue https://github.com/angular/components/issues/13431 in that both are related to the sort causing animation to default to void (instead of whatever the default state is when rows are not sorted).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sreaf6\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

The purpose of this service is to provide a convenient and accessible way for developers to monitor and respond to text selections within specific HTML elements.\r\n\r\nText selection is a common interaction in web applications, and it is crucial to ensure a positive user experience for both mouse and keyboard users. The proposed Text Selection Service aims to simplify the process of monitoring text selections, making it easier for developers to build accessible applications.\r\n\r\nThe Text Selection Service could include methods for:\r\n- Retrieving the currently selected text.\r\n- Getting the range at a specified index.\r\n- Monitoring text selection within a specific HTML element.\r\n- Emitting events when the text selection starts or ends.\r\n- Ensuring accessibility by considering both mouse and keyboard interactions.\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Allow to develop CDK menus opening on text selection (like on Medium)\r\n- Allow to develop tooltips based on text selection (?)\r\n- Maybe more features I didn't think about","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28156","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(CDK): text selection service\" (#28156)"},{"Id":"2001256613","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T10:56:45","Actor":"nikos-moysiadis","Number":"28153","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(google-maps): convert to standalone","State":"closed","Body":"Converts google maps module to standalone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(google-maps): convert to standalone\" (#28153)"},{"Id":"2001277376","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T10:36:25","Actor":"nikos-moysiadis","Number":"28154","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(youtube-player): convert to standalone","State":"closed","Body":"Converts youtube player module to standalone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28154","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(youtube-player): convert to standalone\" (#28154)"},{"Id":"2000413059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T10:35:29","Actor":"robertIsaac","Number":"28150","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(update): v17 migration process node_modules","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nthe original explanation is here https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/20301#issuecomment-1816592456\r\nbut short version, v17 migration while processing files to look for `@angular/material/legacy-`, it also include node_modules files\r\nthis causes two problems\r\n1. it's very slow for everyone\r\n2. it makes nx migration fails as mentioned in the link above\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. create new v16 of Angular `npx @angular/cli@16 new`\r\n2. add angular material `ng add @angular/material`\r\n3. update cli to v17 `ng update @angular/cli`\r\n4. update material to v17 `ng update @angular/material`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nit should take couple of seconds to updater material since it's a new project with few .ts files\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nit takes around 2 minutes with a very powerful PC\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 17.0.1\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.7\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.1\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.1\r\n@angular/material               17.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28150","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(update): v17 migration process node_modules\" (#28150)"},{"Id":"2000746379","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T10:35:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28152","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): prevent ng update schematic from checking node_modules","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the `ng update` schematic was cheking `node_modules` and .d.ts files when looking for legacy imports.

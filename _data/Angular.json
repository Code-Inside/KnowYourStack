I put all routes in routes.txt\r\n\r\n \"prerender\": {\r\n   \"routesFile\": \"routes.txt\"\r\n },\r\n\r\nIt worked well until I realized that some of pre-render pages had empty content. Every time I run the prerender, it has random results, some pages works some pages don't. if I only have 2-5 routes, the pre-render works fine and consistent. My suspicious is that when pre-render, angular just blasts calls to Firebase and doesn't wait until Firebase returns the data, hence the empty pre-render page.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to set pre-render to do it synchronously or a way for prerender to wait until each page is finished?\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nno error\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.1.2\r\nNode: 20.11.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.2\r\n@angular/fire                   17.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54267","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 17 Prerendering (Static Site Generation (SSG)) does not wait until the request is done when using with Firebase\" (#54267)"},{"Id":"2119723044","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-06T00:42:22","Actor":"DevWedeloper","Number":"54266","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo in Angular Material Scrolling","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nChange to either \"This is often\" or \"This offers\"\r\n\r\n> This often a better user experience on mobile devices, as it allows the browser chrome to scroll away.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/cdk/scrolling/overview\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54266","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Typo in Angular Material Scrolling\" (#54266)"},{"Id":"2118587007","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-05T19:07:40","Actor":"rearl","Number":"54254","RawContent":null,"Title":"computed signal does not recalculate when depending signal uses equality function","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGiven the following simplified component:\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <h1>dynamic count that works : {{ list().length }}!</h1>\r\n    <h2>computed doesn't update : [{{count()}}]</h2>\r\n    <h2>effect does update : [{{countProp.length}}]</h2>\r\n    <button (click)=\"add()\">add</button>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App {\r\n  list = signal<string[]>(['a', 'b'], {\r\n    equal: (arr1: string[], arr2: string[]) => arr1.length === arr2.length,\r\n  });\r\n  count = computed(() => this.list().length);\r\n  countProp: string[] = [];\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    effect(() => (this.countProp = this.list()));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  add() {\r\n    this.list.update((list) => {\r\n      list.push('a');\r\n      return list;\r\n    });\r\n    // it always works if a new array is created\r\n    // this.list.update((list) => [...list, 'a']);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe signal `count` is not recalculated even though the signal `list` is updated (due to the custom equality function it even emits if an item is added to the array).

A few stacktraces to show where this happens:\r\n1. `[formControl]`:\r\n    * [form_control_directive.ts:128](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_directive.ts#L128)\r\n2. `[formControlName]`:\r\n    * [form_control_name.ts:145](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_name.ts#L145)\r\n    * [form_control_name.ts:206](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_name.ts#L206)\r\n    * [form_group_directive.ts:170](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_group_directive.ts#L170)\r\n3. `[formGroupName]`:\r\n    * [form_group_name.ts:74](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_group_name.ts#L74)\r\n    * [abstract_form_group_directive.ts:40](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/abstract_form_group_directive.ts#L40)\r\n    * [form_group_directive.ts:202](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_group_directive.ts#L202)\r\n    * [form_group_directive.ts:332](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_group_directive.ts#L332)\r\n\r\nThese `AbstractControl.updateValueAndValidity()` calls mean that every time a new `[formControl]`/`[formControlName]`/`[formGroupName]`/`[formArrayName]` directive is instantiated in the template, a significant part of the form tree has to reduce value again, and rerun validation checks.\r\n\r\n## Performance implications\r\n\r\nIf we consider an example of a `FormArray` with `N` `FormControl`s inside, and some non-trivial validation at the `FormArray` level ([demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-cz2rek?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html)), then we'll quickly see that this is a significant amount of work. More specifically, just displaying this form causes:\r\n* the `FormArray` to allocate an array of size `N` (for storing value), `N` times.\r\n* the `FormArray`-level validator to be rerun `N` times\r\n\r\nMoreover, all of this work appears unnecessary, because:\r\n* the form being rendered (or not) should have no impact on the form state (stored in the tree of `AbstractControl`s),\r\n* we are rerunning all of these validation checks with the exact same form value, getting the same results, every time.\r\n\r\n## So why do we have it?\r\n\r\nIt seems that these calls are remnants of the days when the template-driven and reactive forms frameworks were a single thing. I can imagine that these may be needed to:\r\n* support the [`ngModel` on reactive form directives](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_directive.ts#L79-L103)\r\n* [support the setting of template-driven validators through reactive form directives](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_directive.ts#L115-L116)\r\n\r\nUsing these features is a terrible idea, and they have been deprecated for at least 5 years now (https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12708, https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/22633, https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28996).\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCan we please remove the leftovers of these legacy features, and get the performance benefits?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54260","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve form initialization performance by removing template-driven code from reactive form directives\" (#54260)"},{"Id":"2116809662","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-05T15:15:20","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"54239","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): create pending task while defer block loading is in progress","State":"closed","Body":"This PR updates the logic of defer blocks to create an internal pending task to indicate that an application is not yet stable.

When the value of the `model` changes, it will emit an event with the current value.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these changes expand two-way bindings to accept `WritableSignal`. This will make it easier to transition existing code to signals in a backwards-compatible way.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: 'counter',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  host: {\r\n    '(click)': 'increment()',\r\n  }\r\n})\r\nexport class Counter {\r\n  value = model(0);\r\n\r\n  increment(): void {\r\n    this.value.update(current => current + 1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `<counter [(value)]=\"count\"/> The current count is: {{count()}}`,\r\n})\r\nclass App {\r\n  count = signal(0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** with these changes model inputs should be mostly working. There are a few places where things will be improved in a follow-up PR:\r\n- Ensuring that the language service works correctly with the new TCB for two-way bindings.\r\n- Avoid having to return an object literal from `ModelSignal.subscribe`.\r\n- Figure out the performance implications of checking if the value is a signal each time the `twoWayProperty` instruction is called.\r\n- Figure out if we should remove `applyValueToInputSignal` from `MODEL_SIGNAL_NODE`.\r\n- Avoid the extra variable in the two-way binding TCB.\r\n- Adding a diagnostic when `input()` is mixed with `@Output()` in a two-way binding.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54252","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Initial implementation of model inputs\" (#54252)"},{"Id":"2117351264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-04T22:47:03","Actor":"johnnygerard","Number":"54249","RawContent":null,"Title":"In the API documentation, many directives are labeled `class` instead of `directive`.","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nFor example, [NgIf](https://angular.dev/api/common/NgIf) has the `class` label in angular.dev instead of the `directive` label (see [NgIf](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf) in angular.io).\r\n\r\nHaving the wrong label affects filtering as well.

But child component's of B are properly cleaned up, B's DOM objects (nodes) are also properly cleaned up (unless there is a ViewChild in B, see the `@for` I added and the slight memory decrease when navigating back), so I'm wondering if it really is some sort of caching how much sense does it make to partially cache destroyed routed components? How many cache hits would there be, are top level routing components always initialised with the same data?

stumbled upon this issue in the project in which we are reading css variables in the runtime, in the prod build they were doubled due to inline styles redundancy).\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nDo

Performance & Core Web Vitals","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n@angular/core and @angular/cli\r\n\r\n### Problems :\r\n\r\n- Using custom fonts from **Google Fonts** can significantly impact FCP, LCP and initial load performance in Angular applications.\r\n\r\n- Downloading fonts from Google servers adds **extra HTTP requests** and **latency**, slowing down initial paint times.\r\n\r\n- The **font swapping** has the potential to cause layout shifts and so impact Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution :\r\n\r\n- Introduce a **built-in** **mechanism** in Angular to **automatically downloads fonts** specified by their Google Fonts names (or similar identifiers) during the build process and **self-host fonts** within the application, eliminating the need for external font services like Google Fonts.\r\n\r\n- Utilize **preconnect**, **preload**, and **size-adjust** for optimal performance and seamless font rendering.\r\n\r\n### Benefits :\r\n\r\n- **Improved Performance:** Reduces reliance on external requests, minimizes layout shifts (thanks to the underlying CSS size-adjust) , and enables efficient caching.\r\n\r\n- **Improved FCP and LCP:** Optimized fonts and proactive loading strategies contribute to significantly faster loading times and smoother user experiences.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced SEO:** Better Core Web Vitals can lead to higher search engine ranking and increased website traffic.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced Security:** Minimizes exposure to external vulnerabilities and provides more control over font sources.\r\n\r\n- **Developer Experience:** Built-in font optimization in Angular improves developer experience.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAnyone interested is welcome to comment on what the proposed syntax and feature set will be.\r\n\r\nInspired by next.js automatic font self-hosting library (

#26339)\r\n```scss\r\n$font-url: \"assets/my-font.woff\";\r\n$font-url2: \"assets/my-font.woff2\";\r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: \"my-font\";\r\n  src: url($font-url2) format(\"woff2\"),\r\n  url($font-url) format(\"woff\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- Replace the urls with absolute or relative path like \"../../assets/\", \"projects/my-lib/assets/\", \"assets/\" or \"/assets\"\r\n\r\nBut the ng builld command still fail. Do I missed something ?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- Create a angular 17 workspace with a library\r\n- Add a `url(\"/assets/my-font.woff2\")` in any scss file\r\n- Run `ng build` command``\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nBuild failed with 1 errors\r\n<stdin>:3:11: ERROR: Could not resolve \"/assets/my-font.woff2\"\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.1.2\r\nNode: 18.19.0\r\nNpm: 10.2.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27037","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Could not resolve url(\"/assets/my-font.woff2\") with angular 17\" (#27037)"},{"Id":"2117039879","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-05T09:03:57","Actor":"piozygmunt","Number":"27033","RawContent":null,"Title":"External library not excluded from build despite being defined in browser field","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild, serve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nExternal library that is marked with `false` in `package.json` (`browser` field) is still added to final bundle.

I'm not sure if it is correct that esbuild invokes plugins for disabled libraries or maybe angular-plugin should filter disabled entries. \r\n\r\nSimilar simple setup (esbuild + excluded library in browser field) but without angular works as expected.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27033","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"External library not excluded from build despite

The development server now has a specific `prebundle` option to allow more control over prebundling while still allowing other forms of caching within the Angular CLI. The `prebundle` option can be a boolean value of `true` or `false` that will enable or disable prebundling, respectively. Additionally, the option also has an object long-form. This long-form enables prebundling and currently contains one property named `exclude`. The `exclude` property supports cases where a package should not be prebundled and rather should be bundled directly into the application code. These cases are not common but can happen based on project specific requirements. If the `prebundle` option is enabled when using the `browser` builder or any other Webpack-based builder, it will be ignored as the Webpack-based development server does not contain such functionality.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27021","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow control of Vite-based development server

It seems now certain initialization methods are getting called before content children exist in some cases?\r\n\r\nPrior to this update it looks like `_cacheRowDefs()` was not called until `ngAfterContentChecked()` which meant all content children queries had values. In `17.1.10` however this call now has a chance to run in `_outletAssigned()`.\r\n\r\n`_outletAssigned()` checks for the existence of: \r\n- `this._rowOutlet`\r\n- `this._headerRowOutlet`\r\n- `this._footerRowOutlet`\r\n- `this._noDataRowOutlet`\r\n\r\nHowever, when `_cacheRowDefs()` is called here (as a result of `_render()` getting called), it uses these `ContentChild` queries:\r\n- `this._contentHeaderRowDefs`\r\n- `this._contentFooterRowDefs`\r\n- `this._contentRowDefs`\r\n\r\nHowever, these are all undefined still when run with `17.1.0` or higher at the moment (at least when run in our library's storybook). It seems they are maybe getting called too early because of `_outletAssigned()`? When run in `17.0.6` or any early version this was never the case because these methods only were called after `ngAfterContentChecked()`. The problem here is those empty values get passed to `_getOwnDefs()`, which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprivate _getOwnDefs<I extends {_table?: any}>(items: QueryList<I>): I[] {\r\n  return items.filter(item => !item._table || item._table === this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause this method assumes items exist, but they are actually undefined in this instance an error gets thrown and no tables can load.\r\n\r\nI assume because `_render()` looks like it still gets called in `ngAfterContentChecked()` everything would be fine as long as `_getOwnDefs()` and possibly other internal methods were updated to handle null/undefined scenarios.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI am unsure how to recreate this at the moment. I assume it only occurs on a more old-school non-standalone component example perhaps? I wanted to open this ticket as this will prevent us from allowing anyone to update to `17.1.0` or higher until we can get something figured out here.\r\n\r\nOur extension of the CDK table is purely for styling much like the MatTable and its directives. We do not alter any of this logic or override any lower CDK functions.\r\n\r\nI will work on recreating this in a stackblitz and update this ticket when/if I can.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTables load like normal.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')\r\n    at MtrTable._getOwnDefs

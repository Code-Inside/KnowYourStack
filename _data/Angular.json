I have tried everything on the web to increase it's performance with luck. I used App Shell, Webpack and even changed my server to nginx to serve static content but it's the same. Also another problem that the page takes about 18 seconds to fully which is really huge. Although I am using i18n because the application it's multi language. When I used App shell, my TTFB decreased to 60 ms which is ideal but the probelm that the page only rendered in the static html for the homepage for the whole app. If i tried to analyze any route it will return the same html which will effect my SEO. I understand that I can use csr and google can index it but i don't want to target only google and can be indexed from any craweler.\r\nHowever, I tried using prerender instead of server side and it did it's magic and loaded the page very quickly but the problem that my web app is really huge have about 80k routes which is not logic. Although that I have a huge server that can store all of this but I thought that's would be stupid idea. Does anyone know any ideas to solve this situation. you will find below my website link and please let me know what do you think with this situation!!!\r\nwww.easyschools.org\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27361","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Universal ttfb to first byte is very slow and fully page load \" (#27361)"},{"Id":"385659714","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-30T00:48:31","Actor":"linwrui","Number":"27344","RawContent":null,"Title":"Parse error when responseType=\"text\"","State":"closed","Body":"One strange thing I noticed is that when I set responseType=\"text\", the body returned by HTTPClient is a bit abnormal.\r\nNetWorke screenshot :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22316156/49214456-aa0e2b00-f401-11e8-8ac7-f829c3569e9c.png)\r\n\r\nBut the http response.body is like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22316156/49214514-cf029e00-f401-11e8-8296-e5e5fbb5b521.png)\r\n\r\nWhy there are double double quotation marks?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27344","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Parse error when responseType=\"text\"\" (#27344)"},{"Id":"385977607","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-29T23:51:40","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"27360","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): More precise return type for `InjectableDecorator`","State":"open","Body":"closes #26942\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27360","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): More precise return type for `InjectableDecorator`\" (#27360)"},{"Id":"385699541","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-29T22:59:46","Actor":"ezhuikova","Number":"27348","RawContent":null,"Title":"Life cycle - ControlValueAccessor ","State":"closed","Body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nif i use ngControl like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class AnyComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {\r\n   constructor(@Self() public controlDir: NgControl) {\r\n      controlDir.valueAccessor = this;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe life cycle looks like this:\r\n**WriteValue\r\nOnInit**\r\n\r\nI think this is incorrect behavior.

So at this point, after selecting one the the children, at the path `grandfather/1/father/children/one`, if I refresh the page, the uri changes to `grandfather/1` as expected, but I can still see the child component i.e, `Children{One|Two|Three}Component`, and as the select option has been reseted on the page refresh, if I try to choose the same child I get the error mentioned in the description.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.0.4\r\nNode: 8.13.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: \r\n... \r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.10.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core         7.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   7.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular          7.0.4\r\n@schematics/update           0.10.4\r\nrxjs                         6.3.3\r\ntypescript                   3.1.3\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

build/packaging process is unable to remove third party dependencies from unused components in a library.  The example provided includes a library called components containing a component that imports moment.js and one that doesn't.  When only the component that DOES NOT use moment is imported into the application the resulting application bundle will still contain moment.  I have tried to force the build process to use esm5 instead of fesm 5 and this does not help. The only thing left referencing moment would be the metadata.json.  This problem makes it difficult to build large component libraries using the cli due to the fact that all runtime transitive dependencies will be included in the final bundle whether they are used or not.  I would like to know why this is and where the problem resides.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/babeal/ng-tdp\r\n\r\nclone, run ```npm install```, then ```npm run analyze```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe results of the webpack analysis will show moment in the main bundle as well as inspecting the minified main.js in the dist folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.1.0\r\nNode: 8.12.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.1.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.11.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.11.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.11.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.11.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.11.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.1.0\r\n@angular/cli                       7.1.0\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular                7.1.0\r\n@schematics/update                 0.11.0\r\nng-packagr                         4.4.0\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.1.6\r\nwebpack                            4.23.1\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27340","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular cli - not removing dependencies of unused library components\" (#27340)"},{"Id":"385530140","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-29T01:37:54","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"27338","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): proper accounting of bound vars in i18nExp fns (FW-747)","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds proper accounting of bound vars (e.g. `bind(ctx.myVar)`) used in `i18nExp` instructions.

I have tried everything on the web to increase it's performance with luck. I used App Shell, Webpack and even changed my server to nginx to serve static content but it's the same. Also another problem that the page takes about 18 seconds to fully which is really huge. Although I am using i18n because the application it's multi language. When I used App shell, my TTFB decreased to 60 ms which is ideal but the probelm that the page only rendered in the static html for the homepage for the whole app. If i tried to analyze any route it will return the same html which will effect my SEO. I understand that I can use csr and google can index it but i don't want to target only google and can be indexed from any craweler.\r\nHowever, I tried using prerender instead of server side and it did it's magic and loaded the page very quickly but the problem that my web app is really huge have about 80k routes which is not logic. Although that I have a huge server that can store all of this but I thought that's would be stupid idea.

The example provided includes a library called components containing a component that imports moment.js and one that doesn't. When only the component that DOES NOT use moment is imported into the application the resulting application bundle will still contain moment. I have tried to force the build process to use esm5 instead of fesm 5 and this does not help. The only thing left referencing moment would be the metadata.json. This problem makes it difficult to build large component libraries using the cli due to the fact that all runtime transitive dependencies will be included in the final bundle whether they are used or not. I would like to know why this is and where the problem resides.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/babeal/ng-tdp\r\n\r\nclone, run npm install, then npm run analyze\r\n\r\n### The log given by the failure\r\n\r\nThe results of the webpack analysis will show moment in the main bundle as well as inspecting the minified main.js in the dist folder.\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\n\r\nShould not include unused external dependencies into the final bundle\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13082","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular cli - not removing dependencies of unused library components\" (#13082)"},{"Id":"385541189","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-29T02:28:48","Actor":"bsdfzzzy","Number":"13081","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): addProviderToModule bug: add providers into inner Object","State":"open","Body":"Fix bug when add providers into module.\r\nThe issue is here: [#13080](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13080).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13081","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): addProviderToModule bug: add providers into inner Object\" (#13081)"},{"Id":"385539614","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-29T02:21:52","Actor":"bsdfzzzy","Number":"13080","RawContent":null,"Title":"@schematics/angular error: addProviderToModule error when using interceptor","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

Yesterday, I've updated from Angular 6 to Angular 7 using `ng update` and started the project as usual with `ng serve`. \r\n\r\nHowever, I've noticed a strange behaviour with the update. When I've used Angular 6 and I changed some code within the JS-Files from the AngularJS project, the CLI recompiled the app and outputted one changed chunk. \r\nWith Angular (CLI) 7, the CLI recompiles after a change as well, but does not output a changed chunk, so the changed code is not there after the live reload. Source Maps are also broken at this point. However, if I change code within a template file of the AngularJS app, then a new chunk will be generated. \r\n\r\nIn both versions it worked perfectly when changing TypeScript sources (but still, won't update the JS sources within the changed chunk)\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\n\r\nIt should work like it did before, so whenever I change code within the AngularJS code base, the recompilation should output a changed chunk with the new code.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed, that if I remove `allowJs` from my `tsconfig.app.json`, it works as expected with Angular 7. \r\n\r\n### Package Versions:\r\n\r\nAngular (CLI/ Compiler CLI, Language Service etc.): 7.1.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular: 0.11.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13076","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hybrid/ngUpdate build does not output a changed chunk when updating AngularJS javascript sources\" (#13076)"},{"Id":"385248836","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-28T12:37:28","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13074","RawContent":null,"Title":" feat(@schematics/angular): account for root level assets and `resourcesOutputPath`","State":"open","Body":"By default we are only account for assets inside the assets folder.

This would be really usefull.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\n<!-- Please include a link to the repo if this is related to an OSS project. -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13071","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature request: plugable hooks\" (#13071)"},{"Id":"385033164","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-12T06:34:23","Actor":"gtsopour","Number":"13069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Exclude other source.*.xlf files from locales during build (reducing bundle size)","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nPLEASE HELP US PROCESS GITHUB ISSUES FASTER BY PROVIDING THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nISSUES MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION MAY BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATION.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## I'm submitting a...\r\n<!-- Check one of the following options with \"x\" -->\r\n<pre><code>\r\n[ ] Regression (a behavior that used to work and stopped working in a new release)\r\n[ ] Bug report  <!-- Please search GitHub for a similar issue or PR before submitting -->\r\n[ ] Performance issue\r\n[x ] Feature request\r\n[x] Documentation issue or request\r\n[ ] Support request => Please do not submit support request here, instead see https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#question\r\n[ ] Other...

of how to write Angular code following best practices\".\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nThe \"Tree with checkboxes\" example on the [Material Tree examples page](https://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples) has the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-checkbox [checked]=\"descendantsAllSelected(node)\"\r\n                  [indeterminate]=\"descendantsPartiallySelected(node)\"\r\n                  (change)=\"todoItemSelectionToggle(node)\">{{node.item}}</mat-checkbox>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\n/** Whether all the

`some`) during every change detection. In fact, `descendantsAllSelected` will even get called twice as it's called again from `descendantsPartiallySelected`. Isn't this bad practice? Shouldn't we be [caching these values](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#quick-execution) when something is checked/unchecked?

I defined an array called links which contains 9 distinct items.\n2. I used the ngPlural directive to dynamically determine the pluralization case based on the length of the links array.\n3. I defined cases for =0, =1, =2, few and many in the component class.\n4. I also used the **i18nPlural** pipe to map the value 9 to a string according to locale-specific pluralization rules.\n5. Expected Behavior: The ngPlural directive should correctly match the value 9 to the few or many case based on the active locale's pluralization rules _(ar for Arabic)_.\n\nActual Behavior: An error is thrown: ERROR Error: No plural message found for value \"9\". It seems that the ngPlural directive does not correctly handle the few and many cases for the value 9 as per the locale rules\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

Something like this:\n\n```\n@Component({\n\tselector: 'my-component'\t\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n\tmyService = inject(MyService);\n\n\tname = input<string>();\n\n\tprivate updated = effect(() => {\n\t\tconst name = name();\n\t\tif (name) {\n\t\t\tthis.myService.setName(name);\n\t\t}\n\t})\n}\n\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class MyService {\n\tprivate name = signal<string>();\n\n\tsetName(name: string) {\n\t\tthis.name.set(name);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis looked quite boilerplatey to me so I had an idea if we could introduce something like a linkedInput where we could connect a service variable to a component input in a single line.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMy proposition would be to add something like this:\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-sample',\n  template: `\n    Hello {{ greeting() }}\n  `,\n  styles: ``,\n})\nexport class SampleComponent {\n  private service: SampleService = inject(SampleService);\n\n  name = linkedInput<string>(this.service.name);\n  greeting = this.service.greeting;\n\n  constructor() {\n    // Just to simulate input change\n    this.name.set('John');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhich would directly set a signal in the service\n\n```\n@Injectable()\nexport class SampleService {\n  name = signal<string>('');\n\n  greeting = computed(() => {\n    return `dear ${this.name()}`;\n  });\n}\n```\n\nA simple example of what I had in mind:\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-m1nfkxf6?file=src%2Fapp%2Fsample%2Fsample.component.ts\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo other alternatives so far","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60913","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"linkedInput suggestion\" (#60913)"},{"Id":"3005045559","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-18T14:11:06","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"60914","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `8b24063` -> `94729f4` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `279c93e` -> `64d0e9d` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This experimental system is intended to provide support for investigation of future unit testing efforts within the Angular CLI. As this is experimental, no SemVer guarantees are provided, the API and behavior may change, and there may be unexpected behavior. Available test runners may be added or removed as well.\r\n\r\nThe setup is somewhat different than the previous unit-testing builders. It uses a similar mechanism to that of the `dev-server` and requires a `buildTarget` option. This allows the code building aspects of the unit-testing process to leverage pre-existing option values that are already defined for development. If differing option values are required for testing, an additional build target configuration specifically for testing can be used.\r\n\r\nThe current vitest support has multiple caveats including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n* No watch support\r\n* `jsdom` based testing only (`jsdom` must be installed in the project)\r\n* Custom vitest configuration is not supported\r\n* Code coverage is not yet available\r\n* Reporter customization is not yet available\r\n\r\nAn example configuration that would replace the `test` target for a project is as follows:\r\n```\r\n\"test\": {\r\n    \"builder\": \"@angular/build:unit-test\",\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n        \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.spec.json\",\r\n        \"buildTarget\": \"::development\",\r\n        \"runner\": \"vitest\"\r\n

'/src/app/shared/some.component.html',`\n\nSince Angular 19, these paths don't work anymore and we had to use a lot of ../ to point to the file we need.\n\nAngular documentation seem to indicate

Those browser artifacts might contain files with spaces. This is incompatible with the Bazel version we are using, so the inprocess runfile creation was a workaround for this— If we remove that flag, we might cause issues for Mac users.\r\n\r\nWe have a few options I think:\r\n\r\n1. drop the flag, and hope it doesn't break any runfile generation for browsers. I suspect it won't work...— alternatively try renaming browser files.\r\n\r\n2. keep the flag for now, and temporarily keep the disabled FS patches (needs to be manually specified by users)\r\n\r\n3. do solution (2) but once migration allows it, update to Bazel 7— so that the bug with inprocess resolution is nicely fixed.\r\n\r\nI think (3) is a good plan moving forward and we don't need any runfile tricks. In Bazel 8, the runfiles with space issue is also resolved— allowing us to drop the inprocess runfile creation as well (if we want).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30119","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: fix `bazel run` invocations of `js_binary/js_test`\" (#30119)"},{"Id":"2998911260","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:17:46","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30113","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): pass `preserveSymlinks` option to Karma esbuild builder","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nEnsure that several previously omitted options are correctly passed to the Karma esbuild builder, improving consistency and expected behavior.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30113","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): pass `preserveSymlinks` option to Karma esbuild builder\" (#30113)"},{"Id":"2999971186","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:16:35","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30118","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.8 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30118","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.8 release\" (#30118)"},{"Id":"2999813410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T15:13:22","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30117","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30117","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.8\" with changelog.\" (#30117)"},{"Id":"2999379499","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T11:42:38","Actor":"geromegrignon","Number":"30116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enhance ng new boilerplate with a Signal example","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Description\n\nA similar way React CRA app has a counter button in the initial boilerplate, doing quite the same for Angular `ng new` AppComponent boilerplate could be a good opportunity to promote Signals.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n\nBased on the current boilerplate content, it could be a 'like' button, each click incrementing a related counter.\n\nIt would be a simple way to show a basic Signal usage, even if deleted after all.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhance ng new boilerplate with a Signal example\" (#30116)"},{"Id":"2999068602","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T09:39:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30115","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: minor code changes in karma `AngularAssetsMiddleware`","State":"open","Body":"Early exits and reduce optional chaining.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30115","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: minor code changes in karma `AngularAssetsMiddleware`\" (#30115)"},{"Id":"2998803026","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T08:43:03","Actor":"timothyBrake","Number":"30111","RawContent":null,"Title":"HMR Triggers Full Page Reload When Using i18n in HTML Template","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using Angular with Vite for development, Hot Module Replacement (HMR) works as expected for standard HTML templates. However, if an i18n attribute is present in the template (e.g., `<h1 i18n=\"@@greetings\">Title</h1>`), editing the template triggers a full page reload instead of a hot update. This negates the benefits of HMR and slows down the development workflow.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Run commands\n\n```\nng new my-i18n-app\ncd my-i18n-app\nng add @angular/localize\nng serve\n```\n\n2. In Chrome navigate to\n[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)\n\n3. Open the Chrome DevTools Network tab and watch for GET requests for chunk files.\n4. In src/app/app.component.html add `<h1>Hello world!</h1>`\n5. HMR is working — only the component is fetched via a GET request.\n6. Now change the same file to include i18n `<h1 i18n=\"@@greetings\">Hello world!</h1>`\n7. HMR is not working — a full page refresh is triggered, and the entire app reloads instead of just updating the component.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your

However, when using the StartDelay configuration, there is no event or mechanism to detect when dragging becomes possible after the delay completes but before movement begins. This leads to a gap in functionality where developers cannot hook into the moment dragging becomes active.\n\nSuggested Solution\nIntroduce an additional event (e.g., cdkDragActivated) that fires once the StartDelay has elapsed and dragging becomes possible, regardless of movement. This would enable more granular control and improve the developer experience when working with delayed drag-and-drop functionality.\n\n\nRelated Code/Documentation\nThe cdkDragStarted event: [Drag and Drop Documentation](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview#drag-and-drop)\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis feature would be particularly useful for scenarios where UI feedback or logic needs to occur as soon as dragging is activated (after the delay), but before the user moves the draggable item.\n\nFor example the user wants to indicate that a element is now draggable with an outline.

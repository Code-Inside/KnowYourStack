It is reasonable to expect that the `ngAfterViewChecked` lifecycle hook will run when a signal updates and the component is refreshed. The hooks are typically run when the host is refreshed so without this change, the update to not mark ancestors dirty would have caused `ngAfterViewChecked` to not run.\r\n\r\nresolves #14628\r\nresolves #22646\r\n\r\nresolves #34347 - this is not the direct request of the issue but generally forcing change detection to run is necessary only because a value was updated that needs to be synced to the DOM. Values that use signals will mark the component for check automatically so accessing the `ChangeDetectorRef` of a child is not necessary. The other part of this request was to avoid the need to \"mark all views for checking since it wouldn't affect anything but itself\". This is directly addressed by this PR - updating a signal that's read in the child view's template will not cause ancestors/\"all views\" to be refreshed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/52302","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(core): Update LView consumer to only mark component for check\" (#52302)"},{"Id":"1954382619","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-20T14:14:29","Actor":"debabratp","Number":"52301","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update first-app-lesson-02.md","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [- ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ -] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, we have encounter a big challenge when trying to integrate it with the server hydration of Web Components, specifically with Stencil.\r\n\r\nOur Angular components are predominantly composed of elements from our Stencil components library. To improve rendering and mitigate flickering of the Web Components, we've been pre-rendering them using Stencil’s `renderToString` method for server-side hydration. This approach has been effective until now but seems incompatible with Angular's non-destructive hydration. The method takes the entire generated HTML (result from Angular SSR rendering) and renders the Web Components, producing a new full HTML page, which certainly modifies the DOM and triggers the [NG0500](https://angular.io/errors/NG0500) Hydration error. \r\n\r\nWe understand that the ideal would be to avoid the DOM manipulation and for that, it would be needed to have some kind of per-component hydration method in Stencil which I think is not available at the moment, and wouldn't be too easy to implement.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that a potential resolution might involve implementing a specific hydration method in the Stencil Angular wrapper, allowing hydration via Angular's DOM renderer functions instead of direct HTML generation. However, I think this wouldn't be easy and might essentially be like implementing a full Stencil to Angular compiler rather than just a wrapper.\r\n\r\nI these solutions are not possible, we would have to skip the hydration of all the web components with `ngSkipHydration` but I think that doesn't solve the issue and by doing this, we would be losing most of the advantages of having the client hydration. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the main issues we are encountering now and preventing us of enabling the non-destructive hydration with `provideClientHydration`. \r\n\r\nWhile I understand that this might not be a direct issue with Angular and the new hydration feature, any guidance on how this might be resolved or mitigated would be very valuable. Also, I was wondering if there might be a way to facilitate collaboration with Stencil or other Web Component libraries to propose a solution. Actually, are you aware if this issue has been addressed in some way in Lit, or is there a possibility for collaboration with that team?\r\n\r\nI've created this [Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angular-ssr-ap-r3s9vc) to reproduce the problem and it would be useful for exploring potential solutions as it hosts the Stencil components in the same environment.\r\n(It should run well on first load, or it can be downloaded as well and run with `./start.sh` script. Basically, it install and build the Stencil components and the Angular wrapper, and then the Angular SSR server)\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this issue, and we look forward to any insights or suggestions you might have.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angular-ssr-ap-r3s9vc\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: NG0500: During hydration Angular expected a text node but found a comment node.\r\n\r\nAngular expected this DOM:\r\n\r\n<my-component _ngcontent-ng-c2448950787=\"\" class=\"hydrated\">\r\n  #text(Click here)  <-- AT THIS LOCATION\r\n  …\r\n</my-component>\r\n\r\nActual DOM is:\r\n\r\n<my-component _ngcontent-ng-c2448950787=\"\" class=\"hydrated\">\r\n  <!--  -->  <-- AT THIS LOCATION\r\n  …\r\n</my-component>\r\n\r\nNote: attributes are only displayed to better represent the DOM but have no effect on hydration mismatches.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem:\r\n  * check the \"AppComponent\" component for hydration-related issues\r\n  * check to see if your template has valid HTML structure\r\n  * or skip hydration by adding the `ngSkipHydration` attribute to its host node in a template\r\n\r\n Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0500\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.2.1\r\nNode: 18.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.1\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for client hydration for Web Components hydrated in the server.\" (#52275)"},{"Id":"1950700294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-18T21:31:31","Actor":"Ameerw04","Number":"52274","RawContent":null,"Title":"by mistake","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In the past there was no really good way to change the styles in my application to accommodate this without knowing the media query that is used. I will present as an example your own code. This is the code from the last example on this [page ](https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/examples)\r\n\r\nHtml\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"example-container\" [class.example-is-mobile]=\"mobileQuery.matches\" *ngIf=\"shouldRun\">\r\n  <mat-toolbar color=\"primary\" class=\"example-toolbar\">\r\n    <button mat-icon-button (click)=\"snav.toggle()\"><mat-icon>menu</mat-icon></button>\r\n    <h1 class=\"example-app-name\">Responsive App</h1>\r\n  </mat-toolbar>\r\n\r\n  <mat-sidenav-container class=\"example-sidenav-container\"\r\n                         [style.marginTop.px]=\"mobileQuery.matches ? 56 : 0\">\r\n    <mat-sidenav #snav [mode]=\"mobileQuery.matches ?

This\r\n     causes `<mat-sidenav-content>` to act as our scrolling element for desktop layouts. */\r\n  flex: 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.example-is-mobile .example-sidenav-container {\r\n  /* When the sidenav is fixed, don't constrain the height of the sidenav container. This allows the\r\n     `<body>` to be our scrolling element for mobile layouts. */\r\n  flex: 1 0 auto;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this code is that on mobile the content in the sidenav container will be under the toolbar so a ``padding-top`` or a ```margin-top``` needs to be added. This forces me to know the breakpoint that the height of the toolbar changes and which variable to use.\r\n\r\nWhy can't you just expose one variable that tells me the height of the toolbar regardless of the screen size, something like ```--mat-toolbar-height```? At the end of the day, as a developer that is all I care about. Regardless of what my determination of a 'mobile' screen is I should just have to add something like this:\r\n```\r\n.example-is-mobile .example-sidenav-container {\r\n  /* When the sidenav is fixed, don't constrain the height of the sidenav container. This allows the\r\n     `<body>` to be our scrolling element for mobile layouts. */\r\n  flex: 1 0 auto;\r\n margin-top: var(--mat-toolbar-height);\r\n}\r\n```\r\ninstead of having to do something like this (this may be wrong but you get the point):\r\n```\r\n.example-is-mobile .example-sidenav-container {\r\n  /* When the sidenav is fixed, don't constrain the height of the sidenav container. This allows the\r\n     `<body>` to be our scrolling element for mobile layouts. */\r\n  flex: 1 0 auto;\r\n margin-top: var(--mat-toolbar-standard-height);\r\n}\r\n@media {what ever the toolbar media query is} {\r\n  .example-is-mobile .example-sidenav-container {\r\n   margin-top: var(--mat-toolbar-mobile-height);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27975","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatToolbar): css variables for the actual height of the toolbar should be exposed\" (#27975)"},{"Id":"1954656824","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-20T16:31:53","Actor":"devknoll","Number":"27973","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(multiple): use Renderer2 for theming instead of direct DOM manipulation","State":"open","Body":"Instead of directly manipulating the DOM via ElementRef (which requires DOM emulation), this change makes it use the Renderer2 interface instead.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27973","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(multiple): use Renderer2 for theming instead of direct DOM manipulation\" (#27973)"},{"Id":"1954307972","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-20T13:34:48","Actor":"Nikami","Number":"27971","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatChipList): chip list disabled should respect each chip item disabled state","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nChiplist [disabled] toggling from disable to enable doesn't respect each chip item [disabled] state.

This makes it difficult to attach overlays to the bottom of custom form fields in a clean non-hacky way.\r\n\r\nBasic example that demonstrates the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Create a basic component that implements `MatFormFieldControl` (just directly copying the example [from the guide here](https://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control) works for this).\r\n2. Add a simple `mat-autocomplete` and wire it up to the input on the component.\r\n3.

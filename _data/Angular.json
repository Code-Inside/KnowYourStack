Most of these external components were not developed with `standalone` in mind, so they have relied on the implicit `standalone: false` up until now.\r\n\r\nThe components are loaded by:\r\n\r\n1. Import `https://cdn-url/the-component.js`\r\n2. `the-component.js` exports a `@Component` and an optional `@NgModule`\r\n3. Instantiate/compile the module with `createNgModule()` (unless the component is standalone)\r\n4. Instantiate/compile the component with `ViewContainerRef.createComponent`\r\n\r\nAfter version 19, I'm **assuming** that the `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` or the `createNgModule` calls will fail, since the component now implicitly has `standalone: true`, but it is also declared in the `@NgModule` and has no imports.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPerhaps one of:\r\n\r\n- Add an option to either `createNgModule` or `createComponent` where the default value can be overridden.\r\n- Allow standalone components to be part of a NgModule `declarations` array, and make them inherit the NgModule `imports` or something.\r\n\r\nThis is all based on a lot of assumptions since as far as I can tell the new default isn't implemented yet. So I'm not sure what a good solution looks like (or even if one is needed).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone yet","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57829","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ability to set the default value of `standalone`\" (#57829)"},{"Id":"2528365171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-16T12:42:28","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"57828","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Fix redirection for guide/typescript-configuration","State":"open","Body":"fixes #57826","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57828","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): Fix redirection for guide/typescript-configuration\" (#57828)"},{"Id":"2528299757","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-16T12:34:09","Actor":"UzairNoman","Number":"57827","RawContent":null,"Title":"NgOptimizedImage not adding preconnects dynamically in SSR application.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI defined this in the ImageComponent.ts directly:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n      provide: IMAGE_LOADER,\r\n      useValue: (config: ImageLoaderConfig) => {\r\n        const url = new URL(config.src);\r\n        const domain = `${url.protocol}//${url.hostname}/`\r\n        // This adds preconnect in the html head\r\n        return \"https://example.com\" + `${url.pathname}`;\r\n        // This doesn't add preconnect in the html head even though the src I defined is static\r\n        return domain + `${url.pathname}`;\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57827","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NgOptimizedImage not adding preconnects dynamically in SSR application.\" (#57827)"},{"Id":"2528068204","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-16T10:25:56","Actor":"mwaibel-go","Number":"57826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Broken link from old docs to new docs","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe page links to https://angular.dev/reference/configs/typescript-configuration which doesn’t exist\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://v17.angular.io/guide/typescript-configuration\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57826","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Broken link from old docs to new docs\" (#57826)"},{"Id":"2526054050","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-16T10:16:14","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"57813","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): stabilize `@let` syntax","State":"closed","Body":"Removes the `@let` syntax from developer preview.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57813","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(core): stabilize `@let` syntax\" (#57813)"},{"Id":"2527198395","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-16T09:34:39","Actor":"can-oezkan","Number":"57819","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: The pipe (\"|\") character is not escaped in markdown tables ","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nWhen the pipe character is used to represent a union type, e.g. `number | string`, the pipe character should be escaped.

I think the result comes from [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/bundler-context.ts), but it's a bit abstracted away and I can't easily find the source.

However, this token appears to be missing in the latest version 18.2.3.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nVersion Affected: Angular Material 18.2.3\r\nImpact: The absence of the word-break token affects how text overflow is handled in tooltips, potentially leading to layout issues or text being cut off incorrectly.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way to modify certain properties of tooltips, such as word-break or max-width. Even when applying a custom class using matTooltipClass, the class is applied to the parent element, whereas these properties need to be applied to the element that actually contains the text to achieve the desired effects.\r\n\r\nBelow is the structure of the tooltip rendered in HTML:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1684272-a79c-4b66-9c82-2dea8d80ffce)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1.

The specific test case that fails is:\r\n\r\n\r\n    component.showModifications = true;\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n    await fixture.whenStable();\r\n\r\n    const loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);\r\n    const autocompletes = await loader.getAllHarnesses(MatAutocompleteHarness);\r\n    expect(autocompletes.length).toBe(1);\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpect the test to pass when running with many other tests.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nFails every time when running multiple tests\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17.3\r\n- CDK/Material:         \"@angular/cdk\": \"^17.3.0\", \"@angular/material\": \"^17.3.0\"\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System : Windows and MacOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29720","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): MatAutocompleteHarness - Unable to retrieve options for autocomplete.

Since we now have global elevation shadows, it would be great if these components used those system shadows instead. Interestingly, the values are exactly the same.\n\n### Use Case\n\nIf I want to change shadows, it would be better to do it systemically for all components like this.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of:\r\n\r\n--mat-select-container-elevation-shadow: 0px 3px 1px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2), 0px 2px 2px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, .14), 0px 1px 5px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, .12);\r\n\r\nShould be:\r\n--mat-select-container-elevation-shadow: var(--mat-app-elevation-shadow-level-2);\r\n\r\nThis change will make it easier to manage and customize shadows globally. This should apply to all shadow tokens, such as:\r\n\r\n--mat-select-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mat-autocomplete-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mat-dialog-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-protected-button-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-protected-button-disabled-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-protected-button-focus-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-protected-button-hover-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-protected-button-pressed-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-extended-fab-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-extended-fab-focus-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-extended-fab-hover-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-extended-fab-pressed-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-fab-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-fab-focus-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-fab-hover-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-fab-pressed-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-fab-small-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-fab-small-focus-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-fab-small-hover-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mdc-fab-small-pressed-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mat-datepicker-calendar-container-elevation-shadow\r\n--mat-datepicker-calendar-container-touch-elevation-shadow\r\n--mat-sidenav-container-elevation-shadow\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29724","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(ALL): Shadow tokens (M3) in components could use system shadows\" (#29724)"},{"Id":"2521874541","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-12T09:36:08","Actor":"yashwantyashu","Number":"29723","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatMenu): Material menu on expansion not announcing \"expanded\" when using a screen reader","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe angular material menu button on focus is announced as menu button collapsed by NVDA or similar screen reader software and in speech viewer it is logged. However, on trigger opening the button using enter key, the expanded state is not announced by the screen reader software nor logged in the speech viewer.\r\n![Screenshot (155)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d4144ac-6630-4819-bab6-3f976d480795)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nLink:https://material.angular.io/components/menu/overview\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the link.\r\n2. Install NVDA or other similar screen reader software and open speech viewer to see the logs.\r\n3. Tab through the interactive elements until it lands on the menu button inside basic menu container\r\n4. Observe the screen reader announcement and speech viewer log.(announces collapsed)\r\n5. Press enter key to open the menu.\r\n6. Observe the screen reader announcement and speech viewer log.(does not announce expanded)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen the user open the menu button using enter key, the screen reader should notify the user about the state change to expanded followed by the submenu items. Can find such similar behavior in mat-select, mat-expansion panels but not in mat-menu.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen the user open the menu button using enter key, the screen reader does not notify the user about the state change to expanded and only announces the submenu items. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29723","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatMenu): Material menu on expansion not announcing \"expanded\" when using a screen reader\" (#29723)"},{"Id":"2520768768","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-11T21:04:00","Actor":"DBowen33","Number":"29721","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(matarial/form-field): error text fix","State":"open","Body":"fixed issue where certain screen reader and browser pairings do not recognize mat-error being inserted into the DOM, changed it to where visibility is changing on the wrapper rather than adding and removing the hint and error wrappers. the changing of visibility should be recognized by all browser and screen reader pairings\r\n\r\nFixes #29616","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29721","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(matarial/form-field): error text fix\" (#29721)"},{"Id":"2520168973","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-11T19:31:47","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29719","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/list): restore before pseudo element","State":"closed","Body":"Re-adds the `::before` element that was removed in #29707, because the removal broke some internal tests.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29719","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(material/list): restore before pseudo element\" (#29719)"},{"Id":"2517709657","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T20:28:39","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"29716","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/radio): use tokens for focused border color","State":"open","Body":"Affects an unselected radio button when focused, like when a cursor is pressing down before selecting\r\n\r\nVariable was never defined, and always falling back to black\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 2 23 45 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d7ad949-93a0-4ecf-9fba-1f4f77d8bf9d)\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 2 28 01 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1364b9a6-11bc-4c43-b3e7-97bea5a0220c)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 2 23 57 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c73c7af6-c84e-4a30-9c45-942d7e639c8d)\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 2 25 25 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b7f1943-3311-4697-8eec-ed85347e212f)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29716","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/radio): use tokens for focused border color\" (#29716)"},{"Id":"2517292596","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T18:25:10","Actor":"manjarijayan","Number":"29715","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): DatePicker Calendar not Closing","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI am using material date picker in an ionic 8 project and the date picker is not closing on selecting the date.

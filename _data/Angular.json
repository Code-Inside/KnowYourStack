This creates a circular dependency between ViewEngine `*Ref` which needs to declare `__NG_ELEMENT_ID__` and ivy factory which needs to create it. The workaround used to be to pass the `*Ref` through stack but that created a very convoluted code. This refactoring simply bundles the two files together and removes the stack workaround making the code simpler to follow.\r\n\r\nrefactor(core): Cleanup non-standard `Injector` handling.\r\n    \r\nDue to historical reasons `Injector.__NG_ELEMENT_ID__` was set to `-1`. This changes it to be consistent with other `*Ref.__NG_ELEMENT_ID__` constructs.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For me, it sounds logical what @mhevery wrote in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35383#issuecomment-590479091, stating that it is intended behaviour for `host.class` being fed into `@Input`. There's no further argumentation, except of a tiny note on further offline/internal discussions (lacking their outcome) and then, the PR chimes in w/o any further explanation of why\r\n\r\nI also feel like it shouldn't be intended for `host : { class: 'class-name' }` to behave differently and that Ivy should've introduced this new behaviour as a breaking change (instead of fixing #35383). So, I'd like to request two things:\r\n1. Could you clarify, why it was _fixed_? In the discussion of #35383, there is no info (except a note on internal/offline discussion).\r\n2. Based on the above: Start the discussion of introducing a breaking change bringing back to how it has been introduced by Ivy in Angular 9 and streamline the experience.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think of the change introduced in PR #35889 being a breaking change. Not for anyone coming from View Engine, but for everyone (like me), coming from Angular 9.0 (see **Real World Example** below).\r\n\r\n#### Real World Example\r\n\r\nI'm using a library catching the `class` input to get control over the applied classes (albeit not the best pattern, this is officially supported). This library has some nice icons I want to use as a remove button for Material's Chips, so I added the `matChipRemove` directive having `host { class: 'mat-chip-remove' }` (and some more stuff). In Angular 9.0, this worked perfectly fine but after upgrading to Angular 9.1 (and 10.x), it broke solely due to the update (which was a pain to debug, by the way ü§∑).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI would've liked to start this discussion in the mentioned issue but it's locked so I thought this is the right place for it.

The comment node is inserted through the `appendChild` helper from `node_manipulation.ts` in most cases.\r\n\r\nThe problem with using `appendChild` here is that it has some extra logic which doesn't return a parent `RNode` if an element is at the root of a component. I __think__ that this is a performance optimization which is used to avoid inserting an element in one place in the DOM and then moving it a bit later when it is projected. This can break down in some cases when creating a `ViewContainerRef` for a non-component node at the root of another component like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<root>\r\n  <div #viewContainerRef></div>\r\n</root>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the `#viewContainerRef` node is at the root of a component so we intentionally don't insert it, but since its anchor element was created manually, it'll never be projected. This will prevent any views added through the `ViewContainerRef` from being inserted into the DOM.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the issue by not going through `appendChild` at all when creating a comment node for `ViewContainerRef`. This should work identically since `appendChild` doesn't really do anything with the T structures anyway, it only uses them to reach the relevant DOM nodes.\r\n\r\nFixes #39556.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39599","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): not inserting ViewContainerRef nodes when inside root of a component\" (#39599)"},{"Id":"738252042","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-07T14:25:47","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"39598","RawContent":null,"Title":"10.2.x fix elements cd on push","State":"open","Body":"_This is a backport of #39452 to the 10.2.x branch._\r\n\r\n##\r\nAs with regular Angular components, Angular elements are expected to have their views update when inputs change.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Angular Elements views where not update if the underlying component used the `OnPush` change detection strategy.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this by calling `markForCheck()` on the component view's `ChangeDetectorRef`.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nThis is similar to how `@angular/upgrade` does it: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3236ae0ee118d0734c90fa9f3767435396213470/packages/upgrade/src/common/src/downgrade_component_adapter.ts#L146.\r\n\r\nFixes #38948.\r\n\r\n##\r\nThis PR also contains some commit the fix/improve the `elements` tests (both unit and e2e tests).

@ngtools/webpack Loader","State":"open","Body":"## Goal\r\nSo I'm trying to apply a typescript transform to angular files _BEFORE_ the webpack plugin `AngularCompilerPlugin` touches them.\r\n\r\n## Problems\r\n- It seems that the webpack loader `@ngtools/webpack` ignores all previous loaders _(The @ngtools/webpack loader does not fully support loader chaining)_ as mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16544#issuecomment-571245469)\r\n- It seems that the `AngularCompilerPlugin` directly touches the filesystem instead of using webpack's virtual filesystem as explained in [this comment](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9089#issuecomment-355558260)\r\n- It seems custom typescript transforms are not on the road map :disappointed:  https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/22434#issuecomment-594074902\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n-  In a few blog posts and tutorials I've seen ([like this one](https://indepth.dev/having-fun-with-angular-and-typescript-transformers)), it seems like I might be able to use the `AngularCompilerPlugin`'s private api `_transformers` or

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.35`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7035)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.34...7.0.35)\n\n-   Add migration guide link to PostCSS 8 error text.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Internally the CLI uses the function for example [for calling the PWA schematic](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b2174947924a781f7db41377be989750e042a968/packages/angular/pwa/pwa/index.ts#L159). This won't be problematic as is already installed as part of the `@angular/schematics` package and in fact it's part of the `node_modules`.\r\n\r\nOnce you'll try to install an external schematic which isn't already available in the `node_modules` the schematic fails.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to manually integrate an installation procedure first and then call the function like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const installNpmPackage = (\r\n  context: SchematicContext,\r\n  packageName: string,\r\n): Promise<void> => {\r\n  return new Promise<void>((resolve) => {\r\n    context.logger.info(\r\n      `üì¶ Installing package '${packageName}' for external schematic setup...`,\r\n    );\r\n    const spawnOptions: SpawnOptions = { stdio: 'inherit' };\r\n    spawn('npm', ['install', packageName], spawnOptions).on(\r\n      'close',\r\n      (code: number) => {\r\n        if (code === 0) {\r\n          context.logger.info(\r\n            `‚úÖ '${packageName}' package installed successfully`,\r\n          );\r\n          resolve();\r\n        } else {\r\n          const errorMessage = `‚ùå installation of '${packageName}' package failed`;\r\n          context.logger.error(errorMessage);\r\n          throw new Error();\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n    );\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst packageName = '@briebug/cypress-schematic';\r\nawait installNpmPackage(context, packageName);\r\nreturn externalSchematic(packageName, 'ng-add', {\r\n  removeProtractor: true,\r\n  addCypressTestScripts: true,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIt would be great to integrate the installation process for a package that's not present in the `node_modules` in the `externalSchematic` function.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19301","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`externalSchematics` should install packages locally when they are no

In Component Class, get a FomGroup with one of its keys as a FormArray which in turn contains FormControls\r\n2. In the template, bind the formGroup to a form element. In this form element, assign the formArray's name to a div and iterate over the controls of the formArray.\r\n3. Use MatFormField wrap inputs or textareas with MatInput attribute, bound to formControls contained in the formArray\r\n4. Add a button to the form element which creates dynamically creates new inputs and appends them to the formArray\r\n5. Add a button to the mat-form-field element for removing that particular formField from the formArray \r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\nThat when you click the remove button of a particular formField, it just removes it.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nIt removes that formfield and goes further to replace the contents of the formField preceding it with its current contents, and if it was empty, it equally replaces the contents of the preceding formField's input/textarea with an empty string (in other words, clears its contents)\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\nThat when the remove button of a particular formField is clicked, it should only remove that formField, if it goes further to bring focus into the input/textarea of the formField preceding it, it should not replace or clear the contents of this preceding formField\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.2.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.7\r\n- Browser(s):

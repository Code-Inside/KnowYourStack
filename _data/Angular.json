It should be smart enough to know that the result is not `null` if the `path` is a `keyof TRawValue`, since that means it'd always be there.\n\n```ts\ntypedGet: <P extends Extract<keyof T, string> | readonly (string | number)[]>(\n    path: P,\n  ) => P extends Extract<keyof T, string>\n    ? AbstractControl<ÉµGetProperty<T, P>>\n    : null;\n```\n\nIs this something angular could reasonably support?

The solution for this behavior will be wrapping signal read with `untracked`.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-o7huam?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nWhen inside effect I have http call via HttpClient, effect starting to track signal that is read inside interceptors.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.7\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.7\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.7\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.7\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.7\n@schematics/angular             18.2.7\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58682","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpInterceptor can trigger effect recomputation\" (#58682)"},{"Id":"2661304717","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T08:59:57","Actor":"marklagendijk","Number":"58680","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `outputFromSignal` function or one-way model","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nNote: this was suggested before in #56923 but I want to argue the case again.\n\nIn the current Angular signal ecosystem the lack of a `outputFromSignal` function or something feels very unnatural.\nThe argument against it is that mostly that \"signals are for state and outputs for events\".\n\nHowever this distinction is not so strictly enforced in the rest of the ecosystem:\n- We get two-way binding using `model`. \n- One can convert a signal to an Observable with `toObservable` and create an output from an Observable with `outputFromObservable`. You could argue that this is needed because Observables can both be used for events and state, but that in itself is an argument against being strict here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is:\n- We have one way binding into a child component using `input`.\n- We have two way binding with a child component using `model`.\n- We don't have a signal way of one way binding out of the child component.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nImplement `outputFromSignal` or something similar.\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nOther patterns (effect, service etc).

Basically, `readResource` returning a string and not a Promise was triggering what I suspect was unintended behavior:\r\n\r\n1. In [`AdapterResourceLoader.preload`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/92f30a749d676a290f5e173760ca29f0ff85ba8c/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/resource/src/loader.ts#L82), a string result from `readResource` leads to the function returning `undefined` instead of `Promise<undefined>`.\r\n2. In [`preloadAndParseTemplate`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/92f30a749d676a290f5e173760ca29f0ff85ba8c/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/annotations/component/src/resources.ts#L403), an `undefined` return value of `preload` results in an immediate `return Promise.resolve(null)` while a `Promise.resolve(undefined)` actually populates the template cache and returns the `template` value.\r\n3. Without a `template` value, the [`ComponentDecoratorHandler.preanalyze`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/annotations/component/src/handler.ts#L374-L376) method will always return `templateStyles: []` - completely ignoring what might have actually been in the template. Which is kind of fair - it never got to see the value of `template`.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the lines, something disagrees about the meaning of `undefined` and/or if there is a semantic difference between `undefined` and `Promise<undefined>`. I'm pretty sure what we want here is the behavior of `Promise<undefined>` where it actually takes the template metadata.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28873","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): bring back style tags in browser builder\" (#28873)"},{"Id":"2662625686","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T19:03:52","Actor":"arobinson","Number":"28870","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unmet peer dependency issue with angular-cli and @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nother\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n```\nâ”œâ”€â”¬ @angular/cli 19.0.0-rc.2\nâ”‚ â””â”€â”¬ @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer 2.0.17\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ âœ• unmet peer @inquirer/prompts@\">= 3 < 7\": found 7.1.0\n```\nRC2 is using 2.0.17 of `@listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer` but using an incompatible version of `@inquirer/prompts`\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```\npnpm i -g @angular/cli@next\nâ€‰WARNâ€‰ 1 deprecated subdependencies found: puppeteer@13.7.0\nPackages: +109 -61\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-------------------------------------------------------------\nProgress: resolved 500, reused 500, downloaded 0, added 109, done\n\n/Users/andrew/.local/share/pnpm/global/5:\n- @angular/cli 18.0.0\n+ @angular/cli 19.0.0-rc.2\n\nâ€‰WARNâ€‰ Issues with peer dependencies found\n.\nâ””â”€â”¬ @angular/cli 19.0.0-rc.2\n  â””â”€â”¬ @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer 2.0.17\n    â””â”€â”€ âœ• unmet peer @inquirer/prompts@\">= 3 < 7\": found 7.1.0\n```\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nWARNâ€‰ Issues with peer dependencies found\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / â–³ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n\n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0-rc.2\nNode: 22.11.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular:\n...\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.0-rc.2\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.0-rc.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.0-rc.2\n@schematics/angular          19.0.0-rc.2\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28870","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unmet peer dependency issue with angular-cli and @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer\" (#28870)"},{"Id":"2662851494","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T19:03:51","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28872","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix peer dep warning for listr2","State":"closed","Body":"The previous version specified `@inquirer/prompts < 7` which caused a warning about invalid peer deps.

While we can refactor our code to only rely on the `default` property, the problem becomes more difficult as it's only reproducible when disabling dependency pre-bundling (i.e. building for production), so our team are not even aware there is a problem during local development and will only find the issue after deployment, which is a bit of a footgun. Ideally behaviour during both development and in production builds would be the same.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```\ngh repo clone mattlewis92/ng-cli-code-splitting-bug\ncd ng-cli-code-splitting-bug\nnpm i\nng serve webpack # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module contains all commonjs exports on the top level object\nng serve esbuild-with-pre-bundle # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module contains all commonjs exports on the top level object\nng serve esbuild-no-pre-bundle # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module only contains a `default` export\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 20.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS:

(see [Dialog._hideNonDialogContentFromAssistiveTechnology](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/ef9cff380771da821fbf018b0e58ed4c0600b355/src/cdk/dialog/dialog.ts#L375C11-L375C55)).\n\nWhen B removes the last dialog (see [Dialog._removeOpenDialog](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/ef9cff380771da821fbf018b0e58ed4c0600b355/src/cdk/dialog/dialog.ts#L348)) while its parent (A) has dialogs open, the aria-hidden attributes are not removed. \n\nThis means that because the parent CDK dialog (A) doesn't know that the child dialog had any attributes set, the **aria-hidden** attributes are never removed again, and the application becomes inaccessible to assistive technologies.\n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-aa1qpb\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

This is especially noticeable when the asynchronous action involves some kind of XHR.\n\nLooking a bit further into it, I noticed that synchronous `getChildren` calls have also regressed in 18.2.0: there are now a lot more calls to this method than in cdk/material 18.1.5.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n18.2.X:\n\nStackBlitz link: [StackBlitz 18.2.X](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-acc226?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

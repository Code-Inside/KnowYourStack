This will be annoying  if we have multiple sources of data, because we'd have to do merge them at the end.\r\n\r\nThese changes switch to constructing the various data structures ahead of time and passing them into the binders to populate them instead.\r\n\r\nI also extracted some of the less trivial types into type aliases so we don't have to repeat them.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): allow node offsets to be overwritten \r\n\r\nIn some cases the offsets produced by `createSourceSpan` might not match the source node exactly (e.g. string literals) so we need to be able to override them.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): change TemplateId terminology \r\n\r\nRenames the `TemplateId` and terminology related to it, because we'll be using it for more than just templates.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): rework type checking internals to accommodate more than components\r\n\r\nCurrently a lot of the internal type checking data structures are set up specifically for components, because we only support type checking of templates. Since this will change in future commits, these changes prepare for it by renaming various methods and separating out component-specific data.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): rework source manager to accommodate directives \r\n\r\nCurrently the `TemplateSourceManager` is set up to specifically cater to component templates. These changes make it more generic so we can reuse it for directives.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): rework resource handling to allow directives \r\n\r\nCurrently only components can have resources, because they're the only symbol kinds being type checked. Since we want to add directives to it, these changes rework the resource handling to accommodate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(language-service): rename internal symbols to accommodate type checking outside a template\r\n\r\nCurrently the language service has some template-specific terminology around type checking, because that's the only place where we had TCB support.

Clearly:\r\n\r\n- we will still support contributors on Windows, and we believe we will be improving and streamlining the experience here\r\n- we will continue testing the Angular CLI for our Windows users. We are aware of the many Windows users using the `ng` CLI.\r\n\r\nWhat is changing? We are no longer actively working towards a Bazel infrastructure that supports native Windows building and testing. There are currently two ways to contribute to Angular on Windows. That is via WSL, or via e.g. native Windows cmd.exe, with Git Bash on top. We acknowledge that the latter worked sometimes, but we also realize it very often breaks as nobody on our team uses, verifies it, and it introduces extra complexity because Bazel on Windows is quite disconnected from Linux/Mac (e.g. no sandboxing). Going forward, to improve our team's effectiveness, and improve our stability guarantees for Windows (and Windows contributors), we are actively discouraging the use of Git Bash for contributing to Angular; but instead ask for WSL to be used. I can speak as one of the few long-term team members that have worked on Windows (without WSL) most of my time, that WSL is great and the contributing experience is much smoother and also easier to \"guide\". It's a positive change because we won't be suggesting \"two ways to contribute on Windows\", where in reality one is very brittle and can break at any time!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29750","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[19.2.x] build: update dev-infra and rework windows native testing\" (#29750)"},{"Id":"2893059358","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-04T15:16:58","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29745","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/eslint-plugin) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/HEAD/packages/eslint-plugin)) | devDependencies | minor | [`8.25.0` -> `8.26.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2feslint-plugin/8.25.0/8.26.0) |\n| [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/parser) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/HEAD/packages/parser)) | devDependencies | minor | [`8.25.0` -> `8.26.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2fparser/8.25.0/8.26.0) |\n| [aspect_bazel_lib](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib) | http_archive | minor | `v2.13.0` -> `v2.14.0` |\n\n---\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Some dependencies could not be looked up.

results in empty component templates","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n18.3.0\n\n### Description\n\nA bugfix in webpack 5.96.0 has broken direct template loading.\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/19235#issuecomment-2688250063\n\nWhen using webpack 5.96.0 or higher, if you set the `directTemplateLoading` option to false in the `AngularWebpackPlugin`, component templates end up being empty.\n\nNote: I've said that this is a regression even though technically nothing in the Angular CLI has changed, however if you are updating the Angular CLI regularly, you are probably also updating webpack regularly, so you will encounter this bug.\n\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nStart with this repository: https://github.com/reduckted/repro-webpack-template\n\nThis is the setup:\n- Contains `AppComponent` that has a template with the content \"hello world\".\n- A custom Angular builder is used to modify the webpack configuration and set `AngularWebpackPlugin.options.directTemplateLoading` to false.\n- A custom loader is to the webpack configuration that replaces all occurrences of \"world\" with \"you\" in HTML files.\n\nWhen this works, the `AppComponent`'s template will end up containing \"hello you\".\n\nStart by cloning the repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/reduckted/repro-webpack-template.git\ncd repro-webpack-template\n```\n\nSwitch to the `ng-webpack595` branch (this uses webpack@5.95.0). and build:\n\n```\ngit checkout ng-webpack595\nnpm i\nnpm run build\n```\nOpen `dist/repro-webpack-template/main.js` and search for \"AppComponent_Template\". You will see that it looks like this:\n\n```js\ntemplate: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {\n  if (rf & 1) {\n    _angular_core__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__[\"ɵɵtext\"](0, \"hello you\\n\");\n  }\n},\n```\n\nThis works correctly and has replaced \"world\" with \"you\".\n\n\nNow switch to the `ng-webpack598` branch (this uses webpack@5.98.0). and build:\n\n```\ngit checkout ng-webpack598\nnpm i\nnpm run build\n```\n\nOpen `dist/repro-webpack-template/main.js` again and search for \"AppComponent_Template\". You will see that it looks like this:\n```js\ntemplate: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {},\n```\n\nThe template is completely empty.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 19.2.0\nNode: 22.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 11.1.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.0\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.0\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.0\n@ngtools/webpack                19.2.0\n@schematics/angular             19.2.0\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nAs @alexander-akait says here: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/19235#issuecomment-2688250063\n\n> it was a bug fix in 5.96.0 and unfortunately your code relied on buggy behavior.\n\nThankfully, the fix is really simple, and @alexander-akait even provided an example of how to fix it. :heart:\n\nThis:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/cb078c276861ce6fb6aaebc589b3c44fcb854c38/packages/ngtools/webpack/src/resource_loader.ts#L129\n\nNeeds to change to:\n```ts\nreturn `data:application/javascript,export { default } from \"${filePath}?${NG_COMPONENT_RESOURCE_QUERY}\";`;\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29728","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Direct template loading in AngularWebpackPlugin results in empty component templates\" (#29728)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2894848940","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-04T16:35:59","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30581","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(material-angular-io): fix docs site deployment","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the docs site deployment which broke after #30570.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30581","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(material-angular-io): fix docs site deployment\" (#30581)"},{"Id":"2889416619","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-04T13:44:48","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30570","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(multiple): resolve host binding issues","State":"closed","Body":"Resolves the following issues with host bindings that weren't caught due to a lack of type checking:\r\n* The `aria-describedby` binding on `mat-chip-listbox` was doing nothing, because the `_ariaDescribedBy` property does not exist.\r\n* The `focus` handler on `mat-chip-row` was passing an event to `_handleFocus` even though one isn't required.\r\n* `MatListOption` was referencing a private method.\r\n* `mat-sort-header` was setting an invalid value to the `_recentlyCleared` signal.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30570","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(multiple): resolve host binding issues\" (#30570)"},{"Id":"2893407527","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-04T13:44:11","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30579","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/stepper): emitting interacted event when item has not changed","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the stepper was marking an item as interacted and emitting an event whenever the `selectedIndex` is assigned, even if it's the same.\r\n\r\nFixes #30540.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30579","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/stepper): emitting interacted event when item has not changed\" (#30579)"},{"Id":"2888772852","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-04T13:42:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30569","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(multiple): remove remaining references to ComponentFactoryResolver","State":"closed","Body":"Removes the remaining APIs that were referencing `ComponentFactoryResolver`.

This is because it expects [two `mousemove` events internally](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L677) in order to correctly identity the target element. For the first time we end up in the handler, it should go into [this condition](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L680) and identify the target element. The second time it should (does not) go into [this condition](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L728).\n\nWhile technically in common use-cases it doesn't happen much that there is only a single `mousemove` event under special conditions, e.g. using a Pen/Stylus its probably possible so I recommend removing this early-return which would make it work for Playwright:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L712\n\nPlaywright bug:

option to NOT truncate, a long/multi-line mat-label within a mat-form-field","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nWe have a situation where we need a very short input (4 digits) but it has a very long label.\nMUCH wider than the required input, and sometimes, much wider than the parent container/page.\n\nUnfortunately, specifying a size on the mat-form-field not only resizes the input, it also resizes and truncates the label to the point of uselessness.\n\nExamples:\n\nIn the first field below, we've set the `mat-form-field` style to `width: 16.666667%`\n\nSmall input with truncated label:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4f0700a-be3a-4983-90d6-7668ecc2fce7)\n\nUpdated styles with label width 600% to match the parent container (6 x 16.666667%)\nThis _does_ make the label the full width, however, it's still not big enough to display the full text:\n```css\n.mat-mdc-form-field .mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper .mat-mdc-form-field-flex .mat-mdc-form-field-infix .mat-mdc-floating-label {\n    width: 600% !important;\n}\n```\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c340ece-dbc6-48b8-91a0-d8b865bbae04)\n\nSo, we added wrapping, to ensure the full label (and the trailing tooltip icon component within the label) is displayed:\n```css\n.mat-mdc-form-field .mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper .mat-mdc-form-field-flex .mat-mdc-form-field-infix .mat-mdc-floating-label {\n    width: 600% !important;\n    text-wrap: auto;\n}\n```\nUnfortunately, this then overlaps the input, as the position of the label is hard-coded in the material styles...\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f86cbd5-f059-443d-849f-6c3f3132da89)\n\nGiven the DOM of the component after rendering, I can't see any simple way to untangle this problem.\n\nObviously, on mobile devices this problem is exacerbated substantially:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71e24f13-2293-4010-9910-9fb56974cc80)\n\nAny

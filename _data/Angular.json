But this would be an huge braking change.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46070","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"activatedRoute queryParams separator\" (#46070)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1244076843","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-21T20:41:29","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"23196","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update saucelabs key","State":"closed","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23196","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update saucelabs key\" (#23196)"},{"Id":"1243979728","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-21T13:39:10","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"23195","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency stylus-loader to v7","State":"open","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [stylus-loader](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader) | [`6.2.0` -> `7.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/stylus-loader/6.2.0/7.0.0) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/stylus-loader/7.0.0/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/stylus-loader/7.0.0/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/stylus-loader/7.0.0/compatibility-slim/6.2.0)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/stylus-loader/7.0.0/confidence-slim/6.2.0)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/stylus-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;700-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribstylus-loadercomparev620v700-2022-05-17)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/compare/v6.2.0...v7.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   minimum supported `Node.js` version is `14.15.0`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Or is there exist another way to collect all component which might be used one the page before the view is rendered?  \r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and

The project consists of a library and an app; the problematic code is in the library (not sure if relevant).\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the minified code in Developer Tools, I can see that the minified code doesn't correspond to the original due to a missing variable assignment. I also checked the transpiled JavaScript code and everything is OK there.\r\n\r\nThis is the original code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/878801/169332102-1dc1d55a-0c6f-4018-b41c-1f31319c35a0.png)\r\n\r\nAnd this is the minified code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/878801/169332340-d60faa61-c13a-41b7-ad36-6f2c8569152d.png)\r\n\r\nYou can see that the minifier converts the if/else statement into `? :`, but the problem appears to be that `new ArrayRefresher` (aka `new Ga`) is not being assigned into `refresher` (aka `k`) in the minified version. The consequence of this omission is obvious.\r\n\r\nI don't have a minimal reproduction of the bug yet, but I'll try to provide that soon.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'handleSubscriber')\r\n```\r\n(because `k` is not assigned to)\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 13.3.6\r\nNode: 16.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.5.5\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.6\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.6\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.6\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23184","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing variable assignment after code minification\" (#23184)"},{"Id":"1241642643","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T11:39:15","Actor":"filipkranjec","Number":"23183","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 13 build time increased","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ x] build\r\n- [ x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, i think.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Problem happens when I try to build or even serve my application.

Maybe private access can be possible if requested and i've created cpu profiles incl. `--verbose` logs (see below timings excerpt): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hPvedPtSet2Nh50iBvKuf7XNOAR4d-Hx?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nPlease let me know who want to access.\r\n\r\nShort summary:\r\n\r\n![Bildschirmfoto 2022-05-19 um 11 44 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5759334/169265616-ead7f81b-c649-4dac-a998-86b4478e0f02.png)\r\n\r\nI have no idea why the most of the time the process is idling... maybe someone with deeper cli skills can help here analyzing the profile. That would be great if someone of the core team could investigate some time here.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nIn the --verbose output we have a massive amout

This makes it much easier to control the behavior of the table when passing a filter value to the data source.\r\nThe same thing is not possible when sorting: currently, the only way to control the behavior of a `MatSort` on a `MatTableDataSource` is to set its `sortingDataAccessor` property. And this is extremely limited because it only allows to control what the sorting algorithm \"sees\" and not how it sorts the data.\r\n\r\nProposition:\r\nAdd a `sortPredicate` analogous to `MatTableDataSource.filterPredicate` to either `MatTableDataSource` or `MatSort`.\r\n\r\nThis property would accept a function with the signature `(a: T, b: T, sort: Sort) => number` to mirror the signature of the comparison function passed to `Array.sort`.\r\nAn alternative would be a signature like `(sort: Sort) => (a: T, b: T) => number` which would return a comparison function derived the current sorting key/order.\r\n\r\nNote that it would be better to be able to override the sort comparison function of only certain columns, in this case a possible solution would be to accept a function with the signature  `(sort: Sort) => ((a: T, b: T) => number) | undefined`  and fallback to the default comparison function on `undefined`.\r\n\r\nThis property would give a lot more control over the sorting algorithm to the user than what is currently possible. \n\n### Use Case\n\nThere is no easy way to customize the sorting algorithm, for ex: https://stackoverflow.com/q/55016642/10061195\r\nThis property would also make it easier to sort nested objects. Currently, this needs to either give a specific name to the column to sort, or to catch the data access using `sortingDataAccessor`.\r\n\r\nFor example, a solution to the given SO question using the proposed property would be:\r\n```ts\r\ndataSource.sortPredicate = (sort: Sort) => {\r\n    if (sort.active === 'code') {\r\n        if (sort.direction === 'asc') {\r\n            return (a, b) => a.localeCompare(b, undefined, { numeric: true });\r\n        } else {\r\n            return (a, b) => b.localeCompare(a, undefined, { numeric: true });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```ts\r\n// JS/TS does not support array as keys in object / Map\r\nconst compare = {\r\n    'code#asc': (a, b) => a.localeCompare(b, undefined, { numeric: true }),\r\n    'code#desc': (a, b) => b.localeCompare(a, undefined, { numeric: true }),\r\n};\r\n\r\ndataSource.sortPredicate = (sort: Sort) => compare[sort.active + '#' + sort.direction];\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24926","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatTable) Add `sortPredicate` to MatTableDataSource or MatSort\" (#24926)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-05-23T03:30:03.5597104Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2174}

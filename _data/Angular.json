It can happen that\r\ndevelopers intend to access such members from within an expression.\r\n\r\nThis currently results in an unclear error from the lexer. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n'Parser Error: Unexpected token # at column 1 in [{{#myField}}] in C:/test.ts@5:2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could improve such errors by tokenizing private identifiers similar to\r\nhow the TypeScript scanner processes them. Later we can report better\r\nerrors in the expression parser or in the typecheck block. This commit\r\ncauses all private identifier tokens to be disallowed, so it never\r\nreaches the type checker. This is done intentionally as private\r\nidentifiers should not be considered valid Angular syntax, especially\r\nbecause private fields are not guaranteed to be accessible from within\r\na component/directive definition (e.g. there cases where a template\r\nfunction is generated outside of the class; which results in private\r\nmembers not being accessible; and this results in mixed/confusing\r\nbehavior).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/42027","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): unclear lexer error when using private identifier in expressions\" (#42027)"},{"Id":"884754859","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-10T17:56:12","Actor":"TeriGlover","Number":"42026","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Edits to remove jargon","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This needs us to create a custom webpack config using the `AngularCompilerPlugin`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nEven though Webpack is kind of an Angular implementation detail, it would be a dream come true to expose a function like `ɵresolveWebpackConfig({target: 'my-app'})` that could be inspired from:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/f6135a20d1f3fd8afe85ba10906afb1fb7e91dea/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/dev-server/index.ts#L99-L104\r\n\r\nI understand that this would considerably extend the public API's surface and that is why I am totally alright if we could start some experiments with a non-public function (hence the `ɵ`).\r\nhttps://github.com/jscutlery/test-utils/blob/ec422695e9de3ecfa560143098bda6198756e860/packages/cypress-mount-integration/src/plugins/index.js#L6-L40\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCreating a public library exposing a webpack config that mimics `@angular-devkit/build-angular` behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you are OK with the idea, I'd be happy to help.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20731","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose Webpack Configuration\"

This actually causes the accessibility engine to detect both main landmarks and thus reports \"Can not have more than one main landmark\". \r\n\r\nI suspect this could be a symptom of the way in which the CDK overlay container is \"appended\" to the bottom of the html document, rather than being nested inside the main landmark element.

There are two other types of things that I am fairly certain are outdated, but I am doubting myself enough to not commit directly\r\n    - There is three usages of `LogicNode` across 3 files, like on [line `68` of `path_node`.](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/prototype/signal-forms/packages/forms/experimental/src/path_node.ts#L68). I think those should be `FieldLogicNode`, but there is also normal `FieldNode` so idk if my initial assumption is right in all those cases.\r\n    - Just like on that line, there is a `FormPath` that I think would be `FieldPath` now, as well as two `formPath`  on line 54 in `unwrapFieldPath`.\r\n\r\nedit: also, I may get around to doing a similar audit of the markdowns in a similar fashion to this PR if that's ok\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61887","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: align JSDocs of experimental sf logic+structure functions\" (#61887)"},{"Id":"3119412430","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T23:52:43","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"61886","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): avoid injecting `ErrorHandler` from a destroyed injector","State":"open","Body":"This commit prevents lazy injection of the internal `ErrorHandler` from a destroyed injector, as it would result in another \"destroyed injector\" error.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61886","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): avoid injecting `ErrorHandler` from a destroyed injector\" (#61886)"},{"Id":"3119401778","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T23:45:03","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"61885","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): inject `APP_ID` before injector is destroyed","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we request `APP_ID` outside the `onDestroy` callback because the injector might already be in a destroyed state when the callback runs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61885","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): inject `APP_ID` before injector is destroyed\" (#61885)"},{"Id":"3119151418","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T21:20:39","Actor":"kirjs","Number":"61884","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.1.0-next.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61884","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.1.0-next.0\" with changelog.\" (#61884)"},{"Id":"3119148912","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T21:18:26","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"61883","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: streamline DevTools release docs","State":"open","Body":"This makes a few changes to try to smooth over the process:\r\n1.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nThe global Router is initialized with an empty route, it then performs a navigation to the URL (route) that is provided by the `this.loacation.path()`. When this initial navigation is cancelled by a CanActivate guard that return `false`, and not a UrlTree to redirect to, the router is stuck on an empty route, and thus if you try to refresh the page by calling `this.router.navigateByUrl(this.router.url)`, it navigates to the empty URL, not the URL that is visible inside the browser.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is confusing, and I believe unintentional. Please correct me if I am wrong in this assumption.\r\nI believe if the intent with the CanActivate guard is to redirect to the empty URL, it must return `this.router.ParseUrl('/')`, not `false`.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nI updated the router to initialize with the URL provided by `this.location.path()`, this makes it so that on initial navigation, when it gets cancelled, the global `router.url` is the URL as is visible in the browser, not a \"secret\" empty route.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI did not know how to classify this PR, but my gut feeling is that bugfix is the correct term","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61860","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(router): Changed Router initial route to match browser location\" (#61860)"},{"Id":"3117811569","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T13:18:02","Actor":"devversion","Number":"61865","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: migrate partial compliance tests to rules_js","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61865","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: migrate partial compliance tests to rules_js\" (#61865)"},{"Id":"3117589979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T12:02:21","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"61864","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): generate llms-full at build time","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61864","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(docs-infra): generate llms-full at build time\" (#61864)"},{"Id":"3117544232","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T11:50:18","Actor":"Ladoxer","Number":"61863","RawContent":null,"Title":"Navigation issue on new v.20 Doc (router data resolver)","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nWhen visiting this url : https://next.angular.dev/guide/router/route-data-resolvers , got 404 page.\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://next.angular.dev/guide/router/route-data-resolvers\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61863","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Navigation issue on new v.20 Doc (router data resolver)\" (#61863)"},{"Id":"3117405221","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T10:56:18","Actor":"devversion","Number":"61862","RawContent":null,"Title":"[20.0.x]: Patch port of #61843, and #61826","State":"open","Body":"Patch port of #61843, and #61826","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/61862","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[20.0.x]: Patch port of #61843, and #61826\" (#61862)"},{"Id":"3117277806","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T10:12:02","Actor":"manfredsteyer","Number":"61861","RawContent":null,"Title":"resource does not recognize HttpErrorResponse as error","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\n1.

Most of cases in Angular SSR is done with Lambda in AWS, using cloudfront functions, which are connected as well to the a S3 bucket. Now the S3 bucket can serve a static page or resource in case when SSR is not needed, and for the rest of the pages that need SSR request get redirect to lambda and are handled there.\n\nWith this breaking change, I notice today that all my static pages were not working when SSR was turned off, because normally CloudFront (but it is same for CDN providers) will just serve the content from an S3 bucket pointing at `/`, which in this case broke because the index.html did not exists anymore.\n\nThis change needs to be reverted. It is no sense that index.csr.html is renamed by angular CLI, if a developer needs to rename it, can very well do it manually in the deployment procedure.\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nJust create a minimal SSR angular app\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nindex.csr.html is procuded by default\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n19\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30458","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Revert index.csr.html to default filename index.html\" (#30458)"},{"Id":"3117165342","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T11:43:08","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30457","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): improve Node.js version check and error messages","State":"closed","Body":"Enhances the Node.js version validation to include Node.js 22.12\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30457","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): improve Node.js version check and error messages\" (#30457)"},{"Id":"3115165746","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T09:50:18","Actor":"trdyer","Number":"30452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Style and script tags respecting base href even when configured as absolute","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWhile creating a new application I came across this behaviour.\n\nAssuming I have an index.html like \n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <title>My newly generated app</title>\n    <base href=\"/demo/\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"favicon.png\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/my/path/to/shared.css\" />\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"/my/path/to/shared.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <my-custom-web-component> </my-custom-web-component>\n    <app-root></app-root>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nthat will load a custom shared web component for many of my applications that are deployed at various paths under `/`.\n\nie \napp 1 is deployed at `/demo/` \napp 2 is deployed at `/demo2/` \nShared components are deployed at `/my/path/to/*.*`\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nI can create one if necessary\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\nThe generated/served HTML looks like \n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"/demo/@vite/client\"></script>\n\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>\n    <title>my newly generated app</title>\n    <base href=\"/demo/\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"/>\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"favicon.png\"/>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/demo/my/path/to/shared.css\"/>\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"/demo/my/path/to/shared.js\"></script>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"></head>\n  <body>\n    <my-custom-web-component> </my-custom-web-component>\n    <app-root></app-root>\n  <script src=\"polyfills.js\" type=\"module\"></script><script src=\"main.js\" type=\"module\"></script></body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nng version\n\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0\n... build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.0\n@schematics/angular          20.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI believe this behaviour is captured in [this](https://medium.com/acute-angular/i-recently-came-across-an-issue-with-base-href-handling-for-relative-paths-that-begin-with-slash-b6d0bb5f9ce0) blog post claiming it started in ng 18","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30452","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Style and script tags respecting base href even when configured as absolute\" (#30452)"},{"Id":"3116806806","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-04T09:30:57","Actor":"jzs11","Number":"30456","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular v20 Migration Failure -

The error occurs during the package loading\n  phase, specifically in the @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer dependency.\n\n\n  Root Cause Analysis\n\n  The issue appears to be in the @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer@2.0.18 package that's a dependency of @angular/cli@19.2.14. The error occurs at line 30:62 in the compiled JavaScript\n  where it's trying to extend a class that's undefined.\n\n  This suggests:\n  1. Missing or incompatible inquirer dependency\n  2. Version mismatch between @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer and its peer dependencies\n  3. Potential ESM/CommonJS module resolution issue\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n  Steps to Reproduce\n\n  1. Create an Angular 19.2.14 project or use existing one\n  2. Run ng add @angular/ssr --project=<project-name>\n  3. Error occurs during \"Loading package information from registry\" phase\n\n  Workaround\n\n  The issue can be bypassed by:\n  1. Manually installing @angular/ssr via npm install @angular/ssr --legacy-peer-deps\n  2. Manually creating the required SSR configuration files following the documentation\n  3. Updating angular.json manually for SSR build configuration\n\n  Expected Behavior\n\n  The ng add @angular/ssr command should successfully add server-side rendering support to the project without errors.\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError Details\n\n  $ ng add @angular/ssr --project=marketplace-app\n  ✔ Determining Package Manager\n    › Using package manager: npm\n  ✔ Searching for

Context\n\n  - This issue persists even after clearing npm cache and reinstalling Angular CLI\n  - The error is consistent across multiple attempts\n  - Using --legacy-peer-deps for other npm

Happily, the vitest runner directly supports [junit](https://vitest.dev/guide/reporters). However, it doesn't seem like there is a way to pass an option for [the output location](https://vitest.dev/guide/reporters.html#reporter-output) of that test output and the docs make it seem like there isn't currently a way to configure vitest directly.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd love a way to direct the junit reporter's output to a file so our CI tools can more easily consume it.

It also requires a change from a relative path\n\n    iconRegistry.addSvgIcon('help', sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('assets/image/help.svg'));\n\nto an absolute path:\n\n    iconRegistry.addSvgIcon('help', sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('/assets/image/help.svg'));\n\nTo allow for a smooth migration process and not to require changes to the application code, it would be best if the Vitest test runner would default to not using the additional path segment or at least to provide a configuration option.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create src/assets/image/help.svg\n1. Change angular.json to include architect.build.options.assets: [\"src/assets\"]\n1.

While this behavior aligns with accessibility guidelines (WCAG), it creates a **usability issue** for the user interface.\n\nThe `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode are not merely decorative animations — they are **functional indicators** of background activity (e.g., data loading, request processing). Disabling animations entirely when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is enabled renders these components static, which can mislead users into thinking the interface is \"frozen\" or unresponsive. This is especially problematic in **single-page applications (SPAs)**, where these components often serve as replacements for native browser loading indicators.\n\nI intentionally enable `prefers-reduced-motion` in Windows 10 to reduce distracting or resource-heavy animations, such as window transitions. However, even with this setting enabled, browsers like **Firefox** and **Chrome** still provide **minimal animations** (e.g., tab loading spinners) to indicate progress. In SPAs, where we rely on custom loading indicators like `mat-progress-bar`, the absence of any animation severely impacts UX.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active, the `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` components in `indeterminate` mode should support a **minimal, non-intrusive animation** to maintain their role as activity indicators. For example:\n\n- **mat-progress-bar**: A subtle bar movement or pulsation, avoiding abrupt transitions.\n- **mat-progress-spinner**: A slow rotation or pulsation instead of complete animation disablement.\n\nAdditionally, developers should be able to **opt-in** to minimal animations via:\n\n- Module configuration (`MatProgressBarModule`, `MatProgressSpinnerModule`)\n- Token-based control (e.g., `MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS`)\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Enable the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting in **Windows 10**:\n   - Go to **Settings → Ease of Access → Display**\n   - Turn off **\"Show animations in Windows\"**\n\n2. Create an Angular application using **Angular Material 20**.\n\n3. Add a `mat-progress-bar` or `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode:\n\n    ```html\n    <mat-progress-bar mode=\"indeterminate\"></mat-progress-bar>\n    <mat-progress-spinner mode=\"indeterminate\"></mat-progress-spinner>\n    ```\n\n4. Open the app in a browser (e.g., **Firefox**).\n\n5. Observe that both components are **completely static**, even during ongoing tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Actual Result\n\nWith `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` enabled, animations for `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode are **fully disabled**, causing the interface to appear **unresponsive** or **frozen**.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Result\n\nThese components should display a **minimal, accessibility-compliant animation** to indicate ongoing activity (e.g., slow movement or pulsation), rather than being completely static.\n\n---\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Angular Material**: 20.0.1  \n- **Angular**: 20.0.0  \n- **Browser**: Firefox (latest), Chrome (latest)  \n- **OS**: Windows 10  \n- **prefers-reduced-motion**: `reduce` (enabled manually)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- This issue is reproducible on the **Angular Material docs site** ([material.angular.dev](https://material.angular.dev)).\n- Attempts to override the behavior via CSS or the `MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS` token were **unsuccessful**.\n- Even in `prefers-reduced-motion` mode, browsers show **minimal tab loading animations**, emphasizing the need for similar UX in SPAs.\n- Possibly related PR: [#30796](https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30796) — automatic handling of `prefers-reduced-motion`.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\n- ✅ Implement a **minimal, non-intrusive animation** for `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active.\n- ✅ Provide a **configuration option** (e.g., via module or DI token) to **enable minimal animations** under `prefers-reduced-motion`.\n- ✅ **Document** this behavior clearly in the Angular Material documentation and offer guidance for **customization**.\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31265","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Minimal Animation for mat-progress-bar and mat-progress-spinner in indeterminate Mode with prefers-reduced-motion Enabled\" (#31265)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-06-05T03:30:02.4170237Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1651}

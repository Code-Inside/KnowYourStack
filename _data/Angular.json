Every angular.io documentation version including discontinued versions [states the following](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#prerequisites) which is incorrect for versions of Angular that currently expect and support non-LTS versions of Node.js.\r\n> Angular requires an [active LTS or maintenance LTS](https://nodejs.org/about/releases) version of Node.js.\r\n> For information about specific version requirements, see the engines key in the [package.json](https://unpkg.com/browse/@angular/core/package.json) file.\r\n  \r\nC.

However when a non-null assertion operator is added like this `((test$ | async)?.prop1)!.prop2`, suddenly a runtime exception is thrown as expected: `ERROR\r\nError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'prop2')`.\r\n\r\nThis is unexpected for me since I would already expect a runtime exception without the non-null assertion operator `!` and because I believed until today that the non-null assertion operator is fully erased during compile time and does not emit to the transpiled JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nA second unintuitive behavior that I discovered while reproducing the error in Stackblitz, was a compile-time error of the expression `(test$ | async)?.prop1` with `test$` being defined as `test$ = of(null)`. I would not expect the compilation to fail since TypeScript strict mode is not enabled and hence the Angular Template compiler should only show an error in the template but not fail during compilation. Second, the emitted error is `Object is possibly 'null'.` which is wrong since a `?` safe navigation operator is used. If it's correct that the compilation fails with an error, then the expected error would be `Property 'prop1' does not exist on type 'never'.`. All of the described issues in this paragraph do not appear when we just remove the Observable & AsyncPipe and defined `test$` as `test$ = null` and the expression as `test$.prop1`.

|| >=14.0.0\"` and is actually breaking in `node 18`...\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to **Node.js 18**, I'm getting the following issue during the build process of an ng12 project:\r\n```sh\r\n...\r\nCompiling @angular/forms : es2015 as esm2015\r\nnode:internal/crypto/hash:71\r\n  this[kHandle] = new _Hash(algorithm, xofLen);\r\n\r\nError: error:0308010C:digital

(/home/runner/work/demo-app/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules/webpack/lib/util/createHash.js:145:18)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69692842/error-message-error0308010cdigital-envelope-routinesunsupported/73465262#73465262), this is due to:\r\n> Node uses OpenSSL for its hash functions and encryption on *nix systems. The latest version of OpenSSL disables MD4 by default—which will break any previously working program that uses MD4.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nAs we can see from the log, the issue comes from `webpack`.\r\nThey fixed it in [v5.61.0](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.61.0) by using a wasm md4 implementation for node 17 support.\r\n\r\nBut issue also occurred with `babel-loader` that got fixed in [v9.0.0](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader/releases/tag/v9.0.0) by updating their hash method from `md4` to `sha256`.\r\n\r\nSo the fix here, would be upgrading **webpack** and **babel-loader** dependencies of **@angular-devkit/build-angular**.\r\n\r\n_(as a test, I've tried manually upgrading them in my `package-lock.json` and this solved the issue)_\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n-\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n- Generating browser application bundles (phase: setup)...\r\nCompiling @angular/core : es2015 as

The resulting background color is a light gray. This can make some label text colors more difficult to read than necessary including the default custom theme set up by the ng add setup script for @angular/material.\r\n\r\nOddly enough if I enable auto dark mode in Chrome's flags it decides to change this white background into a black one which looks much better (this is what initially sent me on this rabbit hole because I forgot it was on and doing things as it does).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mftvsq\r\n\r\nMaterial docs site has the same problem; focus either input field in the first example while using either of the provided dark themes:\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/input/overview\r\n\r\nI first reproduced using the command line tools:\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. ng new <project> (no routing)\r\n2. cd <project>\r\n3. ng add @angular/material (custom theme, enable animations)\r\n4. change the theme to dark mode in styles.scss.\r\n5. add mat input and mat form field modules to app.module.ts\r\n6. add a mat input to app.component which uses a mat-label.\r\n7. ng serve and check it out\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe label should remain readable while the input is focused.\r\n\r\nIMO the focus overlay for input/select/textarea should be less opaque white or should be black (\"surface\" color?) instead to avoid lowering contrast with text color. Not sure if light theme needs adjustment as well, I think it was more readable.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the label and underline should be white instead of primary color for maximum readability.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the material guidelines have to say about this if anything.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe text is difficult to read while the input is focused as the background becomes a light gray and the label color is primary.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 15.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 111.0.5532.2 and 108.0.5359.126\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):  Windows 11 22H2 and Windows 10 21H2\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26441","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Theming): dark theme input labels are hard to read with the built-in custom theme template\" (#26441)"},{"Id":"1535285878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-16T17:36:22","Actor":"maximumCallStackSizeExceeded","Number":"26440","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk-drag-drop, cdk-tree): FireFox (mouseenter) not working with cdkDrag","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n## Different behavior with cdkDrag and  (mouseenter) between Chrome and Firefox\r\n\r\n```\r\n        <cdk-nested-tree-node *cdkTreeNodeDef=\"let node\" \r\n                              (mouseenter)=\"onMouseEnter(node)\" (mouseleave)=\"onMouseLeave(node)\">\r\n            <div\r\n                    cdkDrag\r\n                    (cdkDragStarted)=\"dragStarted()\" (cdkDragEnded)=\"dragEnded()\"\r\n                    (cdkDragDropped)=\"dragDropped()\"\r\n                    (click)=\"selectEntity(node)\"\r\n            >\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Chrome: (mouseenter) event is triggered successfully, after (cdkDragStarted)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Chrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122812012/212735599-6cd192e4-c6a1-4750-b038-36f1e03524a8.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Firefox: same logic fails\r\n\r\n\r\n![FireFox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122812012/212735793-b76e86e6-191f-4727-9394-ab3ac554394e.gif)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

This helps developers to catch possible typos like `http.request('POTS', ...)`, but can result in compilation errors when updating if you have such typos in your code.

In summary, this change causes the constructor for `FormControl` to be decoupled from its implementation. This will allow us to provide multiple constructor signatures in the future, and even to return `FormControl<T>` where `T` takes different values depending on the constructor signature selected.\r\n\r\nSubmitting this change separately is desirable for a few reasons:\r\n- It reduces the risk of landing Typed Forms -- the constructor override is complicated, and is fundamentally separate from the core types.\r\n- It enables us to submit a follow-up change for default values before Typed Forms lands, thus separating the only runtime behavior change from all the types-only changes.\r\n\r\nThis change should have no visible impact on users of `FormControl`.\r\n\r\nSee the Typed Forms design doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cWuBE-oo5WLtwkLFxbNTiaVQGNk8ipgbekZcKBeyxxo.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Also if for some reason you need to make a customization for a particular build configuration your options are seemingly to either bundle a different named file as the \"index\" member in the build configuration, or replace the file in a pre-build step outside of angular-cli. Both of these options mean you must have a different index.html file somewhere that is also unlikely to be supported by tests.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIn angular.json it would be nice to define font css stylesheets; either something like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"fonts\": [\"https://use.typekit.net/abcdef.css\"],\r\n```\r\n\r\nor  perhaps simply:\r\n\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"styles\": [\"https://use.typekit.net/abcdef.css\", \"src/styles.scss\"],\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n* require an internet connection for local development with open access to font apis not being blocked\r\n* tell licensees that the font needs to be available on a number of additional dynamic urls for development purposes\r\n* give up and put a unique index.html file for each build configuration","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22259","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Offer mechanism for font inline optimization that doesn't involve putting the font in index.html\" (#22259)"},{"Id":"1067494897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-30T20:06:08","Actor":"kormide","Number":"22258","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add pkg_npm rules for remaining packages","State":"closed","Body":"Before re-writing the `build.ts` script to use bazel for building, I thought a good place to start would be to add some missing rules.

[`v0.14.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0141)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.0...v0.14.1)\n\n-   Fix `imports` in `package.json` ([#&#8203;1807](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1807))\n\n    This release contains a fix for the rarely-used [`imports` feature in `package.json` files](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) that lets a package specify a custom remapping for import paths inside that package that start with `#`. Support for `imports` was added in version 0.13.9. However, the field was being incorrectly interpreted as relative to the importing file instead of to the `package.json` file, which caused an import failure when the importing file is in a subdirectory instead of being at the top level of the package. Import paths should now be interpreted as relative to the correct directory which should fix these path resolution failures.\n\n-   Isolate implicit sibling scope lookup for `enum` and `namespace`\n\n    The previous release implemented sibling namespaces in TypeScript, which introduces a new kind of scope lookup that doesn't exist in JavaScript. Exported members inside an `enum` or `namespace` block can be implicitly referenced in a sibling `enum` or `namespace` block just by using the name without using a property reference. However, this behavior appears to only work for `enum`-to-`enum` and `namespace`-to-`namespace` interactions. Even though sibling enums and namespaces with the same name can be merged together into the same underlying object, this implicit reference behavior doesn't work for `enum`-to-`namespace` interactions and attempting to do this with a `namespace`-to-`enum` interaction [causes the TypeScript compiler itself to crash](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/46891). Here is an example of how the TypeScript compiler behaves in each case:\n\n    ```ts\n    // \"b\" is accessible\n    enum a { b = 1 }\n    enum a { c = b }\n\n    // \"e\" is accessible\n    namespace d { export let e = 1 }\n    namespace d { export let f = e }\n\n    // \"h\" is inaccessible\n    enum g { h = 1 }\n    namespace g { export let i = h }\n\n    // This causes the TypeScript compiler to crash\n    namespace j { export let k = 1 }\n    enum j { l = k }\n    ```\n\n    This release changes the implicit sibling scope lookup behavior to only work for `enum`-to-`enum` and `namespace`-to-`namespace` interactions. These implicit references no longer work with `enum`-to-`namespace` and `namespace`-to-`enum` interactions, which should more accurately match the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.\n\n-   Add semicolon insertion before TypeScript-specific definite assignment assertion modifier ([#&#8203;1810](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1810))\n\n    TypeScript lets you add a `!` after a variable declaration to bypass TypeScript's definite assignment analysis:\n\n    ```ts\n    let x!: number[];\n    initialize();\n    x.push(4);\n\n    function initialize() { x = [0, 1, 2, 3]; }\n    ```\n\n    This `!` is called a [definite assignment assertion](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-2-7/#definite-assignment-assertions) and tells TypeScript to assume that the variable has been initialized somehow. However, JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion rules should be able to insert a semicolon before it:\n\n    ```ts\n    let a\n    !function(){}()\n    ```\n\n    Previously the above code was incorrectly considered a syntax error in TypeScript. With this release, this code is now parsed correctly.\n\n-   Log output to stderr has been overhauled\n\n    This release changes the way log messages are formatted to stderr. The changes make the kind of message (e.g. error vs. warning vs. note) more obvious, and they also give more room for paragraph-style notes that can provide more detail about the message. Here's an example:\n\n    Before:\n\n         > example.tsx:14:25: warning: Comparison with -0 using the \"===\" operator will also match 0\n            14 │     case 1: return x === -0\n               ╵                          ~~\n         > example.tsx:21:23: error: Could not resolve \"path\" (use \"--platform=node\" when building for node)\n            21 │   const path = require('path')\n               ╵                        ~~~~~~\n\n    After:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] Comparison with -0 using the \"===\" operator will also match 0\n\n            example.tsx:14:25:\n              14 │     case 1: return x === -0\n                 ╵                          ~~\n\n          Floating-point equality is defined such that 0 and -0 are equal, so \"x === -0\" returns true for\n          both 0 and -0. You need to use \"Object.is(x, -0)\" instead to test for -0.\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"path\"\n\n            example.tsx:21:23:\n              21 │   const path = require('path')\n                 ╵                        ~~~~~~\n\n          The package \"path\" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node. Are you trying to\n          bundle for node? You can use \"--platform=node\" to do that, which will remove this error.\n\n    Note that esbuild's formatted log output is for humans, not for machines. If you need to output a stable machine-readable format, you should be using the API for that. Build and transform results have arrays called `errors` and `warnings` with objects that represent the log messages.\n\n-   Show inlined enum value names in comments\n\n    When esbuild inlines an enum, it will now put a comment next to it with the original enum name:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    const enum Foo { FOO }\n    console.log(Foo.FOO)\n\n    // Old output\n    console.log(0);\n\n    // New output\n    console.log(0 /* FOO */);\n    ```\n\n    This matches the behavior of the TypeScript compiler, and should help with debugging. These comments are not generated if minification is enabled.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v12.0.1`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1201-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1200v1201-2021-11-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v12.0.0...v12.0.1)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.44.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1440)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.43.5...1.44.0)\n\n-   Suggest `calc()` as an alternative in `/`-as-division deprecation messages.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add `SassNumber.convert()` and `SassNumber.convertValue()`.

Description\r\n\r\nSome Google fonts are rendering poorly for Windows users when automatic font inlining is turned on\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nStart up a new angular project, and add google open sans font into your `index.html` like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\r\n  <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\r\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n```\r\nSet the font-family of text to 'Open Sans' and font size to 12px.\r\nBuild the project so that the font inlining happens, and serve the static bundle locally. \r\nOne quick example to do this is to run `npx http-server dist/{PROJECT_NAME_HERE}`\r\nNotice that the rendered fonts look jagged and poor aliased.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3110057/143935224-75140edc-9af1-420a-bd88-f0e2e648a010.png)\r\n\r\nIf I turn off

The code duplication is hard to maintain and can easily introduce bugs in our app.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following code:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nwith the current workaround, the code grows to:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  *ngIf=\"myCondition\" class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n<button mat-menu-item  *ngIf=\"!myCondition\" class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething()>\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nwith this proposal, the code would only need to be modified slightly:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"myCondition ? subMenu : null\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Note**: Creating a bogus empty submenu does not work as a workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nVery often I find the need to have a menu, where their submenus are conditional.

missing.\r\nThere is a link to the material design docs which is great, but it would be awesome to have a link to the Angular Material documentation which has code examples and live demos.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it would be cool to have code examples in the JSDocs themselves.\r\nThis helps with discoverability of different ways of using components, for example showing the `mat-flat-button` as an example would be quite useful on the `mat-button` JSDoc\n\n### Use Case\n\nHaving faster access to documentation will not only help new developers who are not familiar with all the APIs that `@angular/material` has to offer, but also help refresh the memory of any developers who works in many context, such as backend work.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24024","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs(material): examples in jsdocs\"

This is not flexible enough to support image CDNs with a variety of URL-based image transformations. \r\n\r\nThe image loader API enhanced should be enhanced to allow users to pass arbitrary attributes through to the loader for use in the construction of image URLs. \r\n\r\nCC @AndrewKushnir @pkozlowski-opensource\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI'm proposing we allow the user to pass data through to the loader using a special attribute that receives an object with arbitrary payload, and then passes that data along to the loader. This would look something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<img ngSrc=\"test.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" [loaderParams]={ \r\n  c_crop: true, \r\n  g_face: true, \r\n  crop_height: 400, \r\n  crop_width: 400} >\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo keep the template from becoming too unreadable, presumably many developers would opt to define the loader parameters in the TypeScript:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst loaderProps: LoaderProps = {\r\n  c_crop: true, \r\n  g_face: true, \r\n  crop_height: 400, \r\n  crop_width: 400 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would require the LoaderProps type to have been defined or imported. The loaderProps could then be consumed as so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<img ngSrc=\"test.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" [loaderParams]=”loaderProps” >\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI also considered passing additional query parameters in a plain string blob, but the proposed data structure lends itself a lot better to typing the data.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48826","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide an API for passing additional data to ngOptimizedImage loaders\" (#48826)"},{"Id":"1555618633","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-24T20:56:36","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"48825","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"fix(compiler): handle css selectors with space after an escaped character.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #48163\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nThe main entry point for the `@angular/localize` package no longer imports the `@angular/compiler` package and now has no external dependencies. This allows the main functionality of the package to be used without requiring any other Angular packages. Only the message digest algorithm implementation from the `@angular/compiler` package was being used and this code is now bundled directly into the final npm package for `@angular/localize`.\r\nThe `tooling` secondary entry point still leverages and requires Angular related packages (`@angular/compiler`/`@angular/compiler-cli`). However, the tooling functionality is not intended to be used and/or bundled in a web application.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48799","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(localize): bundle message digest algorithm directly in npm package\" (#48799)"},{"Id":"1553985443","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-24T18:30:11","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"48815","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: consistent table width with min-width 100%","State":"closed","Body":"Let's have a consistent min-width of the tables across AIO to improve the look of the docs.\r\n\r\nfixes #43840\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48815","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: consistent table width with min-width 100%\" (#48815)"},{"Id":"1555202040","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-24T18:08:43","Actor":"pmoleri","Number":"48821","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular template optional null operator false positive ngtsc 2532","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncompiler, language-service\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter using optional chain operator and reading a nested property I get a false error in the template:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface SomeType {\r\n  a: {\r\n    b: string;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component(...)\r\nclass Component {\r\n    prop?: SomeType = { a: { b: \"Me\" } };\r\n}\r\n\r\n<p>{{ prop?.a.b }}</p>\r\n              ^ error TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n   <summary>see screen capture -></summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12942794/214333552-dec30e7e-4b9e-4321-a4bd-0caf6db8c02e.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pmoleri/angular-ngtsc-2532\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nError: src/app/app.component.html:2:15 - error TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'.\r\n\r\n2 <p>{{ prop?.a.b }}</p>\r\n                ~\r\n\r\n  src/app/app.component.ts:11:16\r\n    11   templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    Error occurs in the template of component AppComponent.\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 15.1.2\r\nNode: 16.15.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.11.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             15.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48821","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular template optional null operator false positive ngtsc 2532\" (#48821)"},{"Id":"1555322036","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-24T16:49:51","Actor":"abhi901abhi","Number":"48822","RawContent":null,"Title":"Multiple web components in same page giving error in chrome like cannot read properties of undefined (reading create) in Angular","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nelements\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated two web components: web-comp-1, web-comp-2\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to add in HTML page, I am getting console error like below in Chrome, not in stackblitz.\r\n\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')\r\nat new m.<computed> (web-comp-1.js:3:2706)\r\nat new t (web-comp-1.js:3:12616)\r\n\r\nWhen I checked the line, the code is,\r\n\r\n(o = (u = F && 1 === a.create.length) ?

The debugger gets attached correctly, but in VSCode no breakpoints are active. When downgrading to Node 16 (LTS), everything works out of the box as it should be.\r\n\r\nYou can make Node 18 work by adding `--host=127.0.0.1` to the `ng serve` command. Then breakpoints get hit. I feel, one should not need to do this on newly creatd projects with the CLI.\r\n\r\nDoes not seem to be an issue directly with the CLI but maybe dev-server or Node itself, but it definitely affects CLI and the default projects are therefor broken (cannot be debugged).\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nNot working:\r\n\r\n* `ng new BreakTest` (no routing, SCSS styles)\r\n* Add breakpoint in `app.component.ts` line 9 (or any other valid line in any source file)\r\n* Start debugging in Chrome\r\n\r\nWorking:\r\n\r\n* `ng new BreakTest` (no routing, SCSS styles)\r\n* Add breakpoint in `app.component.ts` line 9 (or any other valid line in any source file)\r\n* In `package.json` add `--host=127.0.0.1` to `ng serve` command\r\n* Start debugging in Chrome\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAll breakpoints are greyed out and do not get hit with Node 18\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 15.1.2\r\nNode: 18.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.1.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.1.2\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             15.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nPotentially related issues:\r\n\r\n#24442\r\n#23383","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24601","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[BUG] -

just finished upgrading from angular 8 to 13, thanks for https://update.angular.io by the way,\r\n\r\nOur production setup for the rendering of the js files on the main page (where app-root is) was this and it used to work perfectly fine for the production release:\r\n\r\n    <environment exclude=\"Development\">\r\n        <script asp-src-include=\"~/runtime.*.js\"></script>\r\n        <script

With this release, esbuild's serve mode will also respond to HTTP `HEAD` requests, which are just like HTTP `GET` requests except that the body of the response is omitted.\n\n-   Permit top-level await in dead code branches ([#&#8203;2853](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2853))\n\n    Adding top-level await to a file has a few consequences with esbuild:\n\n    1.  It causes esbuild to assume that the input module format is ESM, since top-level await is only syntactically valid in ESM. That prevents you from using `module` and `exports` for exports and also enables strict mode, which disables certain syntax and changes how function hoisting works (among other things).\n    2.  This will cause esbuild to fail the build if either top-level await isn't supported by your language target (e.g. it's not supported in ES2021) or if top-level await isn't supported by the chosen output format (e.g. it's not supported with CommonJS).\n    3.  Doing this will prevent you from using `require()` on this file or on any file that imports this file (even indirectly), since the `require()` function doesn't return a promise and so can't represent top-level await.\n\n    This release relaxes these rules slightly: rules 2 and 3 will now no longer apply when esbuild has identified the code branch as dead code, such as when it's behind an `if (false)` check. This should make it possible to use esbuild to convert code into different output formats that only uses top-level await conditionally. This release does not relax rule 1. Top-level await will still cause esbuild to unconditionally consider the input module format to be ESM, even when the top-level `await` is in a dead code branch. This is necessary because whether the input format is ESM or not affects the whole file, not just the dead code branch.\n\n-   Fix entry points where the entire file name is the extension ([#&#8203;2861](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2861))\n\n    Previously if you passed esbuild an entry point where the file extension is the entire file name, esbuild would use the parent directory name to derive the name of the output file. For example, if you passed esbuild a file `./src/.ts` then the output name would be `src.js`. This bug happened because esbuild first strips the file extension to get `./src/` and then joins the path with the working directory to get the absolute path (e.g. `join(\"/working/dir\", \"./src/\")` gives `/working/dir/src`). However, the join operation also canonicalizes the path which strips the trailing `/`. Later esbuild uses the \"base name\" operation to extract the name of the output file. Since there is no trailing `/`, esbuild returns `\"src\"` as the base name instead of `\"\"`, which causes esbuild to incorrectly include the directory name in the output file name. This release fixes this bug by deferring the stripping of the file extension until after all path manipulations have been completed. So now the file `./src/.ts` will generate an output file named `.js`.\n\n-   Support replacing property access expressions with inject\n\n    At a high level, this change means the `inject` feature can now replace all of the same kinds of names as the `define` feature. So `inject` is basically now a more powerful version of `define`, instead of previously only being able to do some of the things that `define` could do.\n\n    Soem background is necessary to understand this change if you aren't already familiar with the `inject` feature. The `inject` feature lets you replace references to global variable with a shim. It works like this:\n\n    1.  Put the shim in its own file\n    2.  Export the shim as the name of the global variable you intend to replace\n    3.  Pass the file to esbuild using the `inject` feature\n\n    For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected.js`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected.js\n    let processShim = { cwd: () => '/' }\n    export { processShim as process }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will replace all references to `process` with the `processShim` variable, which will cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'`. This feature is sort of abusing the ESM export alias syntax to specify the mapping of global variables to shims. But esbuild works this way because using this syntax for that purpose is convenient and terse.\n\n    However, if you wanted to replace a property access expression, the process was more complicated and not as nice. You would have to:\n\n    1.  Put the shim in its own file\n    2.  Export the shim as some random name\n    3.  Pass the file to esbuild using the `inject` feature\n    4.  Use esbuild's `define` feature to map the property access expression to the random name you made in step 2\n\n    For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected2.js --define:process.cwd=someRandomName`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected2.js\n    let cwdShim = () => '/'\n    export { cwdShim as someRandomName }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will replace all references to `process.cwd` with the `cwdShim` variable, which will also cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'` (but which this time will not mess with other references to `process`, which might be desirable).\n\n    With this release, using the inject feature to replace a property access expression is now as simple as using it to replace an identifier. You can now use JavaScript's [\"arbitrary module namespace identifier names\"](https://togithub.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2154) feature to specify the property access expression directly using a string literal. For example, if you inject the following file using `--inject:./injected3.js`:\n\n    ```js\n    // injected3.js\n    let cwdShim = () => '/'\n    export { cwdShim as 'process.cwd' }\n    ```\n\n    Then esbuild will now replace all references to `process.cwd` with the `cwdShim` variable, which will also cause `process.cwd()` to return `'/'` (but which will also not mess with other references to `process`).\n\n    In addition to inserting a shim for a global variable that doesn't exist, another use case is replacing references to static methods on global objects with cached versions to both minify them better and to make access to them potentially faster. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Injected file\n    let cachedMin = Math.min\n    let cachedMax = Math.max\n    export {\n      cachedMin as 'Math.min',\n      cachedMax as 'Math.max',\n    }\n\n    // Original input\n    function clampRGB(r, g, b) {\n      return {\n        r: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, r)),\n        g: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, g)),\n        b: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, b)),\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function clampRGB(a,t,m){return{r:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,a)),g:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,t)),b:Math.max(0,Math.min(1,m))}}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    var a=Math.min,t=Math.max;function clampRGB(h,M,m){return{r:t(0,a(1,h)),g:t(0,a(1,M)),b:t(0,a(1,m))}}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The deep import node module logic would previously attempt to join an undefined path segment to the resolved path for the `globals` package which would raise a argument type exception. This case has now been fixed by only joining if there is actually a path segment present such as `@import \"globals/x\"`.

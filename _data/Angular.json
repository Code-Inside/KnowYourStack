But when exactly the same file is copied locally (no need to go through monorepo imports), all works fine (so there's no error in implementation).

None of them worked for me:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34478#issuecomment-567579719.\r\n\r\nWhat worked for me was exactly this: https://github.com/ducin/xstate/commit/b12cb0505d0c13070025cf1df118e6ed89270b7b#diff-ebc3d1841e5a32fba603bb62117cc4781a0746724fa35a05d013a5d56e31cbe3\r\n\r\nIt took me ~1 day 😢 to find what is the solution and found it accidentally. I did find the issue, however what I still find disrupting is:\r\n- there are no clear hints out there what might be wrong, e.g. I found no FAQ similar to this issue, no troubleshooting etc.\r\n- available links/issues/tips (coming from community) seem completely outdated\r\n\r\nIn ideal world, hopefully this gets fixed. if not, a warning message (when `npm link` usage found? not sure) would help a lot.

For instance, there is a community plugin for SignalStore that allows the connection with the Redux Devtools extension: https://github.com/angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#devtools-withdevtools\r\n\r\nThis plugin provides the ability to set the label that will be displayed in the devtools when patching the SignalStore state:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npatchState('set user', store, { user: 'Marko' });\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if we call `patchState` multiple times in the same tick:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npatchState('set user', store, { user: 'Marko' });\r\npatchState('reset query', store, { query: '' });\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly the last action will be logged in the devtools because Angular's effect will 'emit' only once.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way to solve this limitation / display multiple state changes that happen in the same tick.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCore APIs should be flexible enough to cover this scenario. For example in Vue, they provide three different types of the `watchEffect` function that is equivalent to `effect` in Angular:\r\n\r\n- `watchEffect`\r\n- `watchPostEffect`\r\n- `watchSyncEffect` <= Redux Devtools plugin needs this one\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to provide different flush timing to `watchEffect` function:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst count = ref(0)\r\n\r\nwatchEffect(() => console.log(count.value), { flush: 'sync' });\r\n// equivalent to:\r\nwatchSyncEffect(() => console.log(count.value));\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore info about Vue effects is available at the following link: https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#watcheffect\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to provide this functionality:\r\n\r\n1.

(but that would be breaking)\r\nThese options would probably need to be mutually exclusive because they could overlap.\r\n\r\nAnother useful thing would be to have access to the current `makeCacheKey` function so we could simply override some parts of the http request to customize the cache key:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { makeCacheKey } from '@angular/common/http';\r\n\r\nfunction customCacheKey(request: HttpRequest) {\r\n    // If only the url is different between server and browser, we can only override this part\r\n    const overridenRequest = request.clone({ url: 'urlToUseInCacheKey' });\r\n    return makeCacheKey(overridenRequest);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction customCacheKeyInterceptor = (req, next) => {\r\n    const newRequest = req.clone({ \r\n        transferCache: { \r\n            cacheKey: customCacheKey(request)\r\n            ...req.transferCache,\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    return next(newRequest);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n#### Second solution: expose `transferCacheInterceptorFn` and let developers use it where needed\r\nAnother way to solve this (closest to the original behavior with `TransferHttpCacheModule`) would be to expose the `transferCacheInterceptorFn` in the public API.\r\n\r\nWe could place this interceptor exactly where we need it in the interceptors chain to control what the request url looks like when cached.\r\n\r\nCaching would be enabled by using the interceptor function in `provideHttpClient()` and calling `provideClientHydration()`.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprovideHttpClient(\r\n    withInterceptors([\r\n        authInterceptorFn, // Add Auth header\r\n        transferCacheInterceptorFn, // Cache requests when they are still undifferentiated between browser & server\r\n        overrideUrlInterceptorFn, // Custom logic to override the url on server, specific to the user's use case\r\n])),\r\nprovideClientHydration(\r\n    withNoHttpTransferCache(), // disable injecting transferCacheInterceptorFn as the last interceptor\r\n    withHttpTransferCacheOptions({ includePostRequests: true }) // optionally provide global options for transferCacheInterceptorFn \r\n),\r\n```\r\nBecause the interceptor would still rely on `CACHE_OPTIONS` which is only provided by `provideClientHydration()`, we could make sure that the interceptor is used with `provideClientHydration()` and print a warning/error otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis approach would require minimal changes to the current implementation without adding any breaking change:\r\n- Always provide `CACHE_OPTIONS` even when using `withNoHttpTransferCache()`,\r\n- Provide `transferCacheInterceptorFn` as `HTTP_ROOT_INTERCEPTOR_FNS` only when `withNoHttpTransferCache()` is not used,\r\n- Remove the current error thrown when both `withNoHttpTransferCache()` and `withHttpTransferCacheOptions()` are used together.\r\n\r\n-------\r\nI believe that this second approach is the best one because it keeps a simple API for simple cases while giving the most flexibility for more advanced use cases. And all of that without any breaking change.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe only alternative is to disable transfer cache from provideClientHydration and rely on a custom caching logic based on an interceptor (like the old `TransferHttpCacheModule` from @angular/universal.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53702","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow customization of HTTP Transfer Cache key\" (#53702)"},{"Id":"2055921278","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-26T16:26:30","Actor":"debascoguy","Number":"53699","RawContent":null,"Title":"sessionStorage is not defined | localStorage is not defined","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nBoth sessionStorage and localStorage  keeps generating the not defined error message.

Our entire codebase just got cleaner and better with this upgrade... and introduced a question.\r\n\r\nWe have a [router-less] Web Component story that, we think, can be improved upon.\r\n\r\nWe have a dozen components that get dynamically loaded when needed. Each component comes with its own Ngrx store. When the component gets initialized, the component talks to the store to ask for data. There is no need to load this store (EnvironmentProvider) before the component is loaded. It would just increase the main bundle size and it could end up not being used at all.\r\n\r\nThis already works in our NgModule story using a homegrown dynamic module loader. FYI It's the most advanced story we have in our Angular codebase.\r\n\r\nWith the clean way of coding when doing defer, we want to ask if there have been thoughts within the Angular team on injecting environment providers into components wrapped with defer? I know EnvironmentProviders was specifically created to avoid injecting them into components by accident. But, if Ngrx is limited to exposing their stores and effects using EnvironmentProviders, there's currently no way of lazy loading them without a route present. There's also no way to inject an Ngrx StoreModule.forFeature(): ModuleWithProviders into a component's import statement.\r\n\r\nI have asked for a solution from @brandonroberts over at Ngrx but, for this particular issue, we are both 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏼.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a LazyEnvironmentProviders type that points to an array of libraries (could also support module federation) that can be lazily loaded inside defer. All the contents of @lazyProviders would get loaded before the component.\r\n\r\nExample of defer:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@defer (on idle) {\r\n   @lazyProviders {[\r\n      '@my-org/store/lazy-provider-1',\r\n      '@my-org/store/lazy-provider-2',\r\n   ]}\r\n    <inventory-map [config]=\"config\"></inventory-map>\r\n  } @placeholder {\r\n    Loading...\r\n  } @lazyProviderError {\r\n    Dev: Cannot lazy load providers\r\n  } @error {\r\n    Dev: Cannot lazy load component\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe lazy module would contain an array of LazyEnvironmentProviders. This would have to be introspected, post-load, by the mechanism in charge of loading up these lazy providers.\r\n\r\nExample of lazy provider (identical to EnvironmentProviders but represent a type that can be introspected and differentiated from the other types of providers):\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { OrchestratorEffects } from './+state/orchestrator/orchestrator.effects';\r\nimport * as fromOrchestrator from './+state/orchestrator/orchestrator.reducer';\r\nimport { LazyEnvironmentProviders, makeLazyEnvironmentProviders } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { provideLazyEffects } from '@ngrx/effects';\r\nimport { provideLazyState } from '@ngrx/store';\r\n\r\nexport function provideWebComponents(): LazyEnvironmentProviders {\r\n  return makeLazyEnvironmentProviders([\r\n    provideLazyState(fromOrchestrator.FEATURE_KEY, fromOrchestrator.reducer),\r\n    provideLazyEffects(OrchestratorEffects),\r\n  ]);\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nA less decoupled solution would be to allow the import of providers within the component itself. The pros of that solution is that we wouldn't have to touch how defer works at the moment. \r\n\r\nInstead, we would introduce a new concept into the component like lazyProviders. \r\n\r\nInstantiating lazyProviders before the actual component would enable us to not break state.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { AsyncPipe } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { provider1, OrchestratorFacade } from '@my-org/store/lazy-provider-1';\r\nimport { provider2 } from '@my-org/store/lazy-provider-2';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'inventory-map',\r\n  templateUrl: './inventory-map.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./inventory-map.css'],\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [\r\n    AsyncPipe,\r\n  ],\r\n  lazyProviders: [\r\n    provider1,\r\n    provider2\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class InventoryMapComponent implements AfterLazyProviderInit {\r\n facade: inject(OrchestratorFacade);\r\n loaded$: this.facade.loaded$;\r\n\r\n  ngAfterLazyProviderInit(providers: LazyEnvironmentProvider[]) {\r\n    console.log('Should not be necessary if lazyProviders are instantiated before the component is.');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  constructor() {}\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53700","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat: ✨ Injecting EnvironmentProvider into component wrapped with @defer\" (#53700)"},{"Id":"2055899421","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-25T22:54:36","Actor":"W014ara","Number":"53698","RawContent":null,"Title":"Any ways to run component outside ssr angular 17","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler-cli, core, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-browser, platform-server\n\n### Description\n\nIs there a way to bypass SSR for individual pages.

In addition, as pointed out in issue #25791, I had to edit the `main.c36c93e7c9c8f569.js` file to change the path to the resources in the assets file to be consistent with that generated by the build.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Angular 17, I am no longer able to build the file such that it runs locally without modification of the angular.json file.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular 17 project\r\nrun \r\n`ng build --base-href HubView --omit-dev`\r\nand edit the index.html file as instructed above. \r\nClick on the generated file - it will not run\r\n\r\nIf I modify the angular.json file as follows\r\n```\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"outputPath\": \"dist/hub-view-v5-17\",\r\n            \"index\": \"src/index.html\",\r\n            \"main\": \"src/main.ts\",\r\n```\r\nthe above technique works.

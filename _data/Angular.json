This guarantees a predictable state (regarding `dirty`, Validation etc.), without having to imperatively clear any previous state modifications.\r\n\r\nDoing this I encountered what seems to be an issue propagating the `disabled` state of the `FormGroup` to the input elements when I swap out the `[formGroup]` binding for a new instance. I noticed that when passing a new instance of a `FormGroup` that is enabled, while the previously bound instance is enabled, my form elements would remain in the disabled state.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I was able to work around this problem by forcing Angular to re-create the relevant form elements in the DOM (in the Stackblitz this is what I do with `asyncFormWithNull$`). This confirms my theory that any updates to the `[formGroup]` binding are not propagated correctly for elements already present in the DOM.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug in the Stackblitz, first use the button 'Disabled form' to swap out the `[formGroup]` binding for a disabled form group, and then swap back to 'Enabled form'.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-2cfeoj\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n@angular/animations\r\n14.2.12\r\n\r\n@angular/cdk\r\n14.2.7\r\n\r\n@angular/common\r\n14.2.12\r\n\r\n@angular/compiler\r\n14.2.12\r\n\r\n@angular/core\r\n14.2.12\r\n\r\n@angular/forms\r\n14.2.12\r\n\r\n@angular/material\r\n14.2.7\r\n\r\n@angular/platform-browser\r\n14.2.12\r\n\r\n@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\r\n14.2.12\r\n\r\n@angular/router\r\n14.2.12\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48561","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Elements bound to reactive form controls not updating disabled state correctly\" (#48561)"},{"Id":"1506396497","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-21T14:32:34","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"48564","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update actions/cache digest to c1a5de8","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/cache](https://togithub.com/actions/cache) | action | digest | `9b0c1fc` -> `c1a5de8` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

To do this, we modified the following file: `@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js` and applied the following patch:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js b/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\nindex 3f469dc..eafca93 100644\r\n--- a/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\n+++ b/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\n@@ -245,10 +245,14 @@ async function getCommonConfig(wco) {\r\n             publicPath: (_b = buildOptions.deployUrl) !== null && _b !== void 0 ? _b : '',\r\n             filename: `[name]${hashFormat.chunk}.js`,\r\n             chunkFilename: `[name]${hashFormat.chunk}.js`,\r\n-            libraryTarget: isPlatformServer ?

Additionally, we turned off the `bundleDependencies` for the server build.\r\n\r\nThe command looks like this:\r\n```sh\r\nENV=$ENV \\\r\nIS_DEV_APP=true \\\r\nLOCALHOST_APP=$PROJECT \\\r\nIGNORE_MISSING_APPS=true\\\r\nNG_PERSISTENT_BUILD_CACHE=1 \\\r\nNODE_OPTIONS=\"--experimental-specifier-resolution=node --max_old_space_size=25600 --loader ./scripts/esm-interop/esm-main-loader.mjs\" \\\r\nTS_NODE_PROJECT=\"./src/tsconfig.$PROJECT.server.json\" \\\r\n./node_modules/.bin/ng run $PROJECT:serve-ssr${CONFIGURATION} $BUILD_ARGS\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What we have encountered with\r\nHowever, upon attempting to build the application, we encountered an issue where Node.js is unable to import the correct bundle from the package.json file. It appears that Node.js is trying to use the \"main\" field in the package.json file, which refers to the legacy resolver, instead of the bundle that was built using the Angular Compatibility Compiler. The following error is thrown at runtime:\r\n```\r\nnode:internal/errors:464\r\n    ErrorCaptureStackTrace(err);\r\n    ^\r\n\r\nError [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2015/core.mjs not supported.\r\nInstead change the require of /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2015/core.mjs to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.\r\n    at /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@agm/core/bundles/agm-core.umd.js:2:76\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@agm/core/bundles/agm-core.umd.js:5:2)\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 0) {\r\n  code: 'ERR_REQUIRE_ESM'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What else we have tried\r\nAs a potential solution, we tried to use the `@angular/tools/esm-interop/*` module loader that was pushed a few days ago. However, this caused other issues during the build. When we were trying to troubleshoot this issue, we saw that the `globby` variable was undefined in the `./node_modules/copy-webpack-plugin/dist/index.js`. We also noticed that at the end of the compilation, `this.debug(...)` is undefined in the `./node_modules/minimatch/minimatch.js` file. There is a problem with the sub `node_modules/` resolution. Basically, the current implementation of `esm-interop` module won't look into the `./node_modules/copy-webpack-plugin/node_modules/` folder in this case.\r\n\r\n```\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.1.3\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.9\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.5\r\n@angular/fire                   7.3.0\r\n@angular/material               14.2.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders           14.0.3\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     14.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24461","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support running ESM for SSR\" (#24461)"},{"Id":"1505877544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-21T08:09:52","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24462","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to TypeScript 4.9","State":"open","Body":"Updates the project to TypeScript 4.9.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24462","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update to TypeScript 4.9\" (#24462)"},{"Id":"1505464642","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-20T23:38:11","Actor":"clydin","Number":"24460","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): implement stats-json option for esbuild builder","State":"open","Body":"When using the experimental esbuild-based browser application builder, the `--stats-json` option can now be used to create an esbuild metafile named `stats.json` in the output directory of the application.

[`v0.16.10`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01610)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.9...v0.16.10)\n\n-   Change the default \"legal comment\" behavior again ([#&#8203;2745](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2745))\n\n    The legal comments feature automatically gathers comments containing `@license` or `@preserve` and puts the comments somewhere (either in the generated code or in a separate file). This behavior used to be on by default but was disabled by default in version 0.16.0 because automatically inserting comments is potentially confusing and misleading. These comments can appear to be assigning the copyright of your code to another entity. And this behavior can be especially problematic if it happens automatically by default since you may not even be aware of it happening. For example, if you bundle the TypeScript compiler the preserving legal comments means your source code would contain this comment, which appears to be assigning the copyright of all of your code to Microsoft:\n\n    ```js\n    /*! *****************************************************************************\n    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use\n    this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the\n    License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    THIS CODE IS PROVIDED ON AN *AS IS* BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n    KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED\n    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\n    MERCHANTABLITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n    See the Apache Version 2.0 License for specific language governing permissions\n    and limitations under the License.\n    ***************************************************************************** */\n    ```\n\n    However, people have asked for this feature to be re-enabled by default. To resolve the confusion about what these comments are applying to, esbuild's default behavior will now be to attempt to describe which package the comments are coming from. So while this feature has been re-enabled by default, the output will now look something like this instead:\n\n    ```js\n    /*! Bundled license information:\n\n    typescript/lib/typescript.js:\n      (*! *****************************************************************************\n      Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n      Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use\n      this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the\n      License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n      THIS CODE IS PROVIDED ON AN *AS IS* BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n      KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED\n      WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\n      MERCHANTABLITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n      See the Apache Version 2.0 License for specific language governing permissions\n      and limitations under the License.\n      ***************************************************************************** *)\n    */\n    ```\n\n    Note that you can still customize this behavior with the `--legal-comments=` flag. For example, you can use `--legal-comments=none` to turn this off, or you can use `--legal-comments=linked` to put these comments in a separate `.LEGAL.txt` file instead.\n\n-   Enable `external` legal comments with the transform API ([#&#8203;2390](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2390))\n\n    Previously esbuild's transform API only supported `none`, `inline`, or `eof` legal comments. With this release, `external` legal comments are now also supported with the transform API. This only applies to the JS and Go APIs, not to the CLI, and looks like this:\n\n    -   JS:\n\n        ```js\n        const { code, legalComments } = await esbuild.transform(input, {\n          legalComments: 'external',\n        })\n        ```\n\n    -   Go:\n\n        ```go\n        result := api.Transform(input, api.TransformOptions{\n          LegalComments: api.LegalCommentsEndOfFile,\n        })\n        code := result.Code\n        legalComments := result.LegalComments\n        ```\n\n-   Fix duplicate function declaration edge cases ([#&#8203;2757](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2757))\n\n    The change in the previous release to forbid duplicate function declarations in certain cases accidentally forbid some edge cases that should have been allowed. Specifically duplicate function declarations are forbidden in nested blocks in strict mode and at the top level of modules, but are allowed when they are declared at the top level of function bodies. This release fixes the regression by re-allowing the last case.\n\n-   Allow package subpaths with `alias` ([#&#8203;2715](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2715))\n\n    Previously the names passed to the `alias` feature had to be the name of a package (with or without a package scope). With this release, you can now also use the `alias` feature with package subpaths. So for example you can now create an alias that substitutes `@org/pkg/lib` with something else.\n\n### [`v0.16.9`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0169)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.8...v0.16.9)\n\n-   Update to Unicode 15.0.0\n\n    The character tables that determine which characters form valid JavaScript identifiers have been updated from Unicode version 14.0.0 to the newly-released Unicode version 15.0.0. I'm not putting an example in the release notes because all of the new characters will likely just show up as little squares since fonts haven't been updated yet. But you can read https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/#Summary for more information about the changes.\n\n-   Disallow duplicate lexically-declared names in nested blocks and in strict mode\n\n    In strict mode or in a nested block, it's supposed to be a syntax error to declare two symbols with the same name unless all duplicate entries are either `function` declarations or all `var` declarations. However, esbuild was overly permissive and allowed this when duplicate entries were either `function` declarations or `var` declarations (even if they were mixed). This check has now been made more restrictive to match the JavaScript specification:\n\n    ```js\n    // JavaScript allows this\n    var a\n    function a() {}\n    {\n      var b\n      var b\n      function c() {}\n      function c() {}\n    }\n\n    // JavaScript doesn't allow this\n    {\n      var d\n      function d() {}\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add a type declaration for the new `empty` loader ([#&#8203;2755](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2755))\n\n    I forgot to add this in the previous release. It has now been added.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;fz6m](https://togithub.com/fz6m).\n\n-   Add support for the `v` flag in regular expression literals\n\n    People are currently working on adding a `v` flag to JavaScript regular expresions. You can read more about this flag here: https://v8.dev/features/regexp-v-flag. This release adds support for parsing this flag, so esbuild will now no longer consider regular expression literals with this flag to be a syntax error. If the target is set to something other than `esnext`, esbuild will transform regular expression literals containing this flag into a `new RegExp()` constructor call so the resulting code doesn't have a syntax error. This enables you to provide a polyfill for `RegExp` that implements the `v` flag to get your code to work at run-time. While esbuild doesn't typically adopt proposals until they're already shipping in a real JavaScript run-time, I'm adding it now because a) esbuild's implementation doesn't need to change as the proposal evolves, b) this isn't really new syntax since regular expression literals already have flags, and c) esbuild's implementation is a trivial pass-through anyway.\n\n-   Avoid keeping the name of classes with static `name` properties\n\n    The `--keep-names` property attempts to preserve the original value of the `name` property for functions and classes even when identifiers are renamed by the minifier or to avoid a name collision. This is currently done by generating code to assign a string to the `name` property on the function or class object. However, this should not be done for classes with a static `name` property since in that case the explicitly-defined `name` property overwrites the automatically-generated class name. With this release, esbuild will now no longer attempt to preserve the `name` property for classes with a static `name` property.\n\n### [`v0.16.8`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0168)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.16.7...v0.16.8)\n\n-   Allow plugins to resolve injected files ([#&#8203;2754](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2754))\n\n    Previously paths passed to the `inject` feature were always interpreted as file system paths. This meant that `onResolve` plugins would not be run for them and esbuild's default path resolver would always be used. This meant that the `inject` feature couldn't be used in the browser since the browser doesn't have access to a file system. This release runs paths passed to `inject` through esbuild's full path resolution pipeline so plugins now have a chance to handle them using `onResolve` callbacks. This makes it possible to write a plugin that makes esbuild's `inject` work in the browser.\n\n-   Add the `empty` loader ([#&#8203;1541](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1541), [#&#8203;2753](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2753))\n\n    The new `empty` loader tells esbuild to pretend that a file is empty. So for example `--loader:.css=empty` effectively skips all imports of `.css` files in JavaScript so that they aren't included in the bundle, since `import \"./some-empty-file\"` in JavaScript doesn't bundle anything. You can also use the `empty` loader to remove asset references in CSS files. For example `--loader:.png=empty` causes esbuild to replace asset references such as `url(image.png)` with `url()` so that they are no longer included in the resulting style sheet.\n\n-   Fix `</script>` and `</style>` escaping for non-default targets ([#&#8203;2748](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2748))\n\n    The change in version 0.16.0 to give control over `</script>` escaping via `--supported:inline-script=false` or `--supported:inline-script=true` accidentally broke automatic escaping of `</script>` when an explicit `target` setting is specified. This release restores the correct automatic escaping of `</script>` (which should not depend on what `target` is set to).\n\n-   Enable the `exports` field with `NODE_PATHS` ([#&#8203;2752](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2752))\n\n    Node has a rarely-used feature where you can extend the set of directories that node searches for packages using the `NODE_PATHS` environment variable. While esbuild supports this too, previously it only supported the old `main` field path resolution but did not support the new `exports` field package resolution. This release makes the path resolution rules the same again for both `node_modules` directories and `NODE_PATHS` directories.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.30.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.30.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.29.0...v8.30.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`075ef2c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/075ef2cf315e75b51b671c40ce9a97c66b2e4b50) feat: add suggestion for no-return-await ([#&#8203;16637](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16637)) (Daniel Bartholomae)\n-   [`7190d98`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/7190d98ff40023f24b0c6a98319ae8a82c99ff5b) feat: update globals ([#&#8203;16654](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16654)) (Sébastien Règne)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`1a327aa`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/1a327aae57f1b68c96b27cc1bd57f8198d5a3a7c) fix: Ensure flat config unignores work consistently like eslintrc ([#&#8203;16579](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16579)) (Nicholas C.

With this release, there will now be a reference in the metafile in the `imports` array with the kind `file-loader`:\n\n    ```diff\n     {\n       ...\n       \"outputs\": {\n         \"out/image-55CCFTCE.svg\": {\n           ...\n         },\n         \"out/entry.js\": {\n           \"imports\": [\n    +        {\n    +          \"path\": \"out/image-55CCFTCE.svg\",\n    +          \"kind\": \"file-loader\"\n    +        }\n           ],\n           ...\n         }\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix byte counts in metafile regarding references to other output files ([#&#8203;2071](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2071))\n\n    Previously files that contained references to other output files had slightly incorrect metadata for the byte counts of input files which contributed to that output file. So for example if `app.js` imports `image.png` using the file loader and esbuild generates `out.js` and `image-LSAMBFUD.png`, the metadata for how many bytes of `out.js` are from `app.js` was slightly off (the metadata for the byte count of `out.js` was still correct). The reason is because esbuild substitutes the final paths for references between output files toward the end of the build to handle cyclic references, and the byte counts needed to be adjusted as well during the path substitution. This release fixes these byte counts (specifically the `bytesInOutput` values).\n\n-   The alias feature now strips a trailing slash ([#&#8203;2730](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2730))\n\n    People sometimes add a trailing slash to the name of one of node's built-in modules to force node to import from the file system instead of importing the built-in module. For example, importing `util` imports node's built-in module called `util` but importing `util/` tries to find a package called `util` on the file system. Previously attempting to use esbuild's package alias feature to replace imports to `util` with a specific file would fail because the file path would also gain a trailing slash (e.g. mapping `util` to `./file.js` turned `util/` into `./file.js/`). With this release, esbuild will now omit the path suffix if it's a single trailing slash, which should now allow you to successfully apply aliases to these import paths.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v15.0.8`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1508-httpsgithubcomnpmpacotecomparev1507v1508-2022-12-14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v15.0.7...v15.0.8)\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n-   [`40aa6fe`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/40aa6fe9055f3fe673fda7032c7da8958d3f574d) [#&#8203;253](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/253) bump fs-minipass from 2.1.0 to 3.0.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

So if someone is looking at the example for mat-menu, in the stackbliz example all of the components are loaded just for the mat-menu.\r\n\r\nThis goes against [angular material best practices](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#shared-feature-module) on feature modules and can easily lead to newbies adapting bad practices by following the example from the lead developers. The \"correct way\" is even outlined in your \"Getting Started\" guide, but not followed by the examples on stackbliz **OR** in the examples in the documentation.\r\n\r\nIMHO the angular material documentation all seems a bit lazy (please see this as constructive) some of the code examples have private members with an underscore some of them dont, some of the examples have 2 components in one file (also against angular best practices). It all just seems really boring for a very cool UI/UX framework. Also, none of the examples use lazy loading which i a pretty sure is standard by now. Again, this is outlined in the guide but not the actual examples for each component, why? Why have a code examples when that code example is a bad outdated practice? \r\n\r\nSome of the examples also seem to be be lacking. One good example for how bad it seems is the CDK overlay component. There is one example yet this module is so dynamic and allows the developer to really enhance a custom look and feel, yet im pretty sure most people will go to stackoverflow for most questions regarding setup of anything else other than open and close functionality, or even just use another module completely ( which i have seen a few times). The documentation talks about position and scroll strategies but it is never actually shown as code implementation. It is such a fun little module but it seems completely overlooked in the documentation, like it is an after thought. \r\n\r\nAnother is the Portal module. Such a awesome module, yet i know people who have been using material for years that dont even know about it. The portal module would also be such an amazing place to introduce newbies to token based injection in angular. \r\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/cdk/overlay/examples","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26315","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Why do the stackbliz examples not follow angular best practices?\" (#26315)"},{"Id":"1508446075","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-22T19:35:14","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"26314","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/global-listener): initial global listener implementation","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26314","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(cdk/global-listener): initial global listener implementation\" (#26314)"},{"Id":"1508373254","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-22T18:31:18","Actor":"Barbiero","Number":"26313","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(autocomplete, cdk): move mat-autocomplete functionality to CDK","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\n[mat-autocomplete](https://material.angular.io/components/autocomplete/overview) is a very good component and it's relatively difficult to find a similar one in the wild. In particular, it's ability to emulate the hard-to-style [datalist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) native element is great.\r\n\r\nOur team uses autocomplete for a search input that shows a list of possible entities that the end user might want. However, mat-autocomplete becomes a bit troublesome because **we don't actually use material!**\r\n\r\nWe managed to style `mat-option` the way we wanted, and we even have complex items as options rather than simple text lines. Autocomplete is awesome because it provides keyboard navigation out of the box, as well as easy-to-use events when selecting an item, all things that we need. But we don't need material animations, or typography, or any of that good stuff because we use our own. Even worse: with material v15, we had to add some `mat-option::ng-deep>:first-child {}` CSS in order to style the wrapper `span` that is automatically created by the new mat-option!\r\n\r\nAngular CDK is a great place to maintain non-stylized behaviors - such as cdk-overlay handling pop ups, or cdk-listbox handling keyboard interaction for lists - but I wish we could have all of the autocomplete specific behavior(specifically, combining overlay/listbox as well as event emitters) in a way that would be agnostic to the styling.\r\n\r\nIn essence, I wish this:\r\n```html\r\n<!-- from https://material.angular.io/components/autocomplete/overview#autocomplete-on-a-custom-input-element -->\r\n<form class=\"example-form\">\r\n  <input type=\"text\"\r\n         placeholder=\"Search for a street\"\r\n         [formControl]=\"control\"\r\n         [matAutocomplete]=\"auto\"\r\n         class=\"example-input\">\r\n  <mat-autocomplete #auto=\"matAutocomplete\">\r\n    <mat-option *ngFor=\"let street of filteredStreets | async\" [value]=\"street\">\r\n      {{street}}\r\n    </mat-option>\r\n  </mat-autocomplete>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould become this:\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"example-form\">\r\n  <input type=\"text\"\r\n         placeholder=\"Search for a street\"\r\n         [formControl]=\"control\"\r\n         [cdkAutocomplete]=\"auto\"\r\n         class=\"example-input\">\r\n  <cdk-autocomplete #auto=\"cdkAutocomplete\">\r\n    <option\r\n        *ngFor=\"let street of filteredStreets | async\"\r\n        cdkOption\r\n        class=\"my-option-class\"\r\n        [value]=\"street\">\r\n       <div class=\"my-special-street-class\">{{street}}</div>\r\n    </option>\r\n  </cdk-autocomplete >\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis would allow developers to easily implement \"autocomplete\" components without having to use `@angular/material`, similar to how we can use `CdkTable` or `CdkTree`.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26313","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(autocomplete, cdk): move mat-autocomplete functionality to CDK\" (#26313)"},{"Id":"1507442023","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-22T10:52:38","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26308","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to Angular 15.1.0 and expand peer dependency range","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the repo to the `next` version of Angular 15.1.0.

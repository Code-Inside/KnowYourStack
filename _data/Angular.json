Create a `signal` and a `computed` based on it.  \n2. Create a second `computed` that depends on the first one.  \n3. Update the signal.  \n4. Observe that the second `computed` does not update unless it explicitly references the original signal.  \n\n---\n\n**Expected Behavior**  \n`hostBoxStyle` should update whenever `this.spacing()` changes, without needing to also reference `this.options()`.  \n\n---\n\n**Actual Behavior**  \n`hostBoxStyle` does not update unless `this.options()` is explicitly referenced. \n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n```true\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.1.5\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 11.1.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.1.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... router, service-worker\n\nPackage Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2001.5\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.1.5\n@angular-devkit/core            20.1.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.1.5\n@angular/cdk                    20.1.5\n@angular/cli                    20.1.5\n@schematics/angular             20.1.3\nng-packagr                      20.1.0\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.8.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n_No response_\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63353","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"computed not updating when based on another computed\" (#63353)"},{"Id":"3349383761","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-24T10:20:38","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"63352","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(docs-infra): ensure we're not creating nested anchor elements.","State":"open","Body":"With #63162, we added automatic link creation on API symbols.

dynamic import","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHi, we are using one package named @wagmi/connectors in multiple apps, it imports some of its dependencies using dynamic import like this (in some functions): \n```ts\n const { EthereumProvider } = await import('@walletconnect/ethereum-provider')\n```\nAll things works correctly while running app in dev mode. but bundled code has some issues. \none of our app is generating incorrect code while bundling this import.\npossibly invalid code:\n```ts\n   var Nn = class s {\n        constructor() {\n            tt(this, \"events\", new zE.EventEmitter),\n            tt(this, \"namespace\", \"eip155\"),\n            tt(this, \"accounts\", []),\n            tt(this, \"signer\"),\n            tt(this, \"chainId\", 1),\n          // other code\n        }\n        static init(e) {\n            return h(this, null, function*() {\n                let t = new s;\n                return yield t.initialize(e),\n                t\n            })\n        }\n        // ... other code\n      }\n\n// related import code from other chunk:\nlet { EthereumProvider: v } = yield import(\"./chunk-ZPGDBFJA.js\")\n\n```\nvalid generated code (from other app):\n```ts\nvar Ro = class s {\n    constructor() {\n        Ve(this, \"events\", new hl.EventEmitter),\n        Ve(this, \"namespace\", \"eip155\"),\n        Ve(this, \"accounts\", []),\n        Ve(this, \"signer\"),\n        Ve(this, \"chainId\", 1),\n        // other code\n    }\n    static async init(e) {\n        let t = new s;\n        return await t.initialize(e),\n        t\n    }\n    // ... other code\n  }\n// related import code from other chunk:\nlet { EthereumProvider: g } = await import(\"./chunk-3H7TA2LI.js\")\n```\n\nAs you can see working code uses await import and async init fn, while non working version uses yield import and normal init() func,  Both apps are using same Angular version (20.2) and also same imported lib version and same tsconfig. \nnon working version had .browserslistrc before but I have now removed it and tried again multiple times.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\ncurrently none, issue only occurs in some apps/setup.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nyield import('chunk...') returns undefined so imported lib doesn't work in affected app.\nerror:  TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'init')\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.2.0\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: yarn 4.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.2.1\n... animations, common, compiler,

browserslist file, but let know if there is any way to confirm target browsers used during build command.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31012","RelatedDescription":"Closed

However, Angular does not include things manually correctly.\n\nFortunately, the Vite's default behavior is easy to get back:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/e899bc7c73a27cdf327875e5d696c50d396a7fc2/packages/vite/src/node/server/index.ts#L1126-L1127\n\nTheir default calls `searchForWorkspaceRoot()`, which is exposed by Vite and can be called manually as documented in https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-fs-allow.\n\nI confirmed that updating the Angular code to the following fixes the issue:\n\n```diff\n- join(serverOptions.workspaceRoot, 'node_modules'),\n+ searchForWorkspaceRoot(serverOptions.workspaceRoot),\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31016","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Serve fails to serve node_modules assets in monorepos\" (#31016)"},{"Id":"3346386293","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-22T19:05:28","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31015","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (20.2.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `3a48544` -> `43118aa` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `cb03391` -> `ae5a9cb` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `cb03391` -> `ae5a9cb` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When set to `true`, pnpm will remove unused catalog entries during installation [#&#8203;9793](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9793).\n- Automatically load pnpmfiles from config dependencies that are named `@*/pnpm-plugin-*` [#&#8203;9780](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9780).\n- `pnpm config get` now prints an INI string for an object value [#&#8203;9797](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9797).\n- `pnpm config get` now accepts property paths (e.g. `pnpm config get catalog.react`, `pnpm config get .catalog.react`, `pnpm config get 'packageExtensions[\"@&#8203;babel/parser\"].peerDependencies[\"@&#8203;babel/types\"]'`), and `pnpm config set` now accepts dot-leading or subscripted keys (e.g. `pnpm config set .ignoreScripts true`).\n- `pnpm config get --json` now prints a JSON serialization of config value, and `pnpm config set --json` now parses the input value as JSON.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- **Semi-breaking.** When automatically installing missing peer dependencies, prefer versions that are already present in the direct dependencies of the root workspace package [#&#8203;9835](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9835).\n- When executing the `pnpm create` command, must verify whether the node version is supported even if a cache already exists [#&#8203;9775](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9775).\n- When making requests for the non-abbreviated packument, add `*/*` to the `Accept` header to avoid getting a 406 error on AWS CodeArtifact [#&#8203;9862](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9862).\n- The standalone exe version of pnpm works with glibc 2.26 again [#&#8203;9734](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9734).\n- Fix a regression in which `pnpm dlx pkg --help` doesn't pass `--help` to `pkg` [#&#8203;9823](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9823).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

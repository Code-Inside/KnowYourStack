This can lead to an infinite loop inside the `parseChain` method which assumes that reporting an error would've skipped over the token, but that won't happen since the `=` token is a recovery point.

I think I understand the intent here, but I believe the `singleRun` scenario was overlooked. When running in watch mode, it's true that you always want Karma to start up and the exit code of the command is irrelevant, since the command runs until the user forces it to stop. But within CICD systems `singleRun` is the norm and the exit code is very important. We do not want karma to start if the compilation fails and the command should exit with a non zero code.\r\n\r\nI think all that is required is to add a reject handler and call that one instead it there are errors `&& singleRun`. I have verified this fix locally and will open a PR with precisely this change against this issue.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate an Angular project using ng cli 13.2.3 or above.\r\n\r\nCreate one unit test. Include a compilation error in the test.\r\n\r\nEnsure the karma option `failOnEmptyTestSuite` is `false`.\r\n\r\nRun `ng test --project=<project-name> --watch=false`\r\n\r\nObserve that karma starts despite the compilation error and the command exits with success.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.8\r\nNode: 14.20.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.17\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.3.9\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.8\r\nng-packagr                      13.3.1\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3\r\nwebpack                         5.73.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, this was introduced at v13.2.3 and as far as I can tell still exists in latest v14.

But with Yarn's `enableGlobalCache` setting it's possible to configure Yarn PnP's implementation to reach outside of the directory subtree containing the Yarn PnP manifest. This was causing esbuild to fail to bundle projects with the `enableGlobalCache` setting enabled.\n\n    To handle this case, *esbuild will now only search for the Yarn PnP manifest in the current working directory of the esbuild process*. If you're using esbuild's CLI, this means you will now have to `cd` into the appropriate directory first. If you're using esbuild's API, you can override esbuild's value for the current working directory with the `absWorkingDir` API option.\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP resolution failures due to backslashes in paths on Windows ([#&#8203;2462](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2462))\n\n    Previously dependencies of a Yarn PnP virtual dependency failed to resolve on Windows. This was because Windows uses `\\` instead of `/` as a path separator, and the path manipulation algorithms used for Yarn PnP expected `/`. This release converts `\\` into `/` in Windows paths, which fixes this issue.\n\n-   Fix `sideEffects` patterns containing slashes on Windows ([#&#8203;2465](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2465))\n\n    The `sideEffects` field in `package.json` lets you specify an array of patterns to mark which files have side effects (which causes all other files to be considered to not have side effects by exclusion). That looks like this:\n\n    ```json\n    \"sideEffects\": [\n      \"**/index.js\",\n      \"**/index.prod.js\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n    However, the presence of the `/` character in the pattern meant that the pattern failed to match Windows-style paths, which broke `sideEffects` on Windows in this case. This release fixes this problem by adding additional code to handle Windows-style paths.\n\n### [`v0.15.2`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0152)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.1...v0.15.2)\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP issue with packages containing `index.js` ([#&#8203;2455](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2455), [#&#8203;2461](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2461))\n\n    Yarn PnP's tests require the resolved paths to end in `/`. That's not how the rest of esbuild's internals work, however, and doing this messed up esbuild's node module path resolution regarding automatically-detected `index.js` files. Previously packages that relied on implicit `index.js` resolution rules didn't work with esbuild under Yarn PnP. Removing this slash has fixed esbuild's path resolution behavior regarding `index.js`, which should now the same both with and without Yarn PnP.\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP support for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;2456](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2456))\n\n    Previously using `extends` in `tsconfig.json` with a path in a Yarn PnP package didn't work. This is because the process of setting up package path resolution rules requires parsing `tsconfig.json` files (due to the `baseUrl` and `paths` features) and resolving `extends` to a package path requires package path resolution rules to already be set up, which is a circular dependency. This cycle is broken by using special rules for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` that bypasses esbuild's normal package path resolution process. This is why using `extends` with a Yarn PnP package didn't automatically work. With this release, these special rules have been modified to check for a Yarn PnP manifest so this case should work now.\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP support in `esbuild-wasm` ([#&#8203;2458](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2458))\n\n    When running esbuild via WebAssembly, Yarn PnP support previously failed because Go's file system internals return `EINVAL` when trying to read a `.zip` file as a directory when run with WebAssembly. This was unexpected because Go's file system internals return `ENOTDIR` for this case on native. This release updates esbuild to treat `EINVAL` like `ENOTDIR` in this case, which fixes using `esbuild-wasm` to bundle a Yarn PnP project.\n\n    Note that to be able to use `esbuild-wasm` for Yarn PnP successfully, you currently have to run it using `node` instead of `yarn node`. This is because the file system shim that Yarn overwrites node's native file system API with currently generates invalid file descriptors with negative values when inside a `.zip` file. This prevents esbuild from working correctly because Go's file system internals don't expect syscalls that succeed without an error to return an invalid file descriptor. Yarn is working on fixing their use of invalid file descriptors.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.22.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.22.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.21.0...v8.22.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`2b97607`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2b97607675e1d0920a3abedd736e2ae00ed26d52) feat: Implement caching for FlatESLint ([#&#8203;16190](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16190)) (Nicholas C.

At the same time, we've been getting lots of requests for Jest in the CLI and even mocha. The different tools have their trade-offs and even though `karma` allows real browser testing it's often outperformed by `jest`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nMeet developers where they are and enable them to use the unit testing framework they want. Remove `karma` by default and instead change `ng test` to output a list of available and supported options, such as `karma` and `jest`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to `ng e2e` and `ng deploy` we can recommend solutions which have high adoption and are maintained by the owner of the testing tool to provide guarantees for higher reliability. \r\n\r\nA challenge with this approach is that it gets harder to automatically generate a unit test for every generated component/directive/component/pipe. We'd like to enable testing vendors to plug into the corresponding generator so they can provide a template that we can use in `ng generate` to produce a dummy unit test.\r\n\r\nThat's the open question as of right now, which will unblock us to provide flexibility while continuing to enforce best practices.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23734","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable developers to select a unit testing framework\"

Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: Angular 11\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOriginally from an Angular 10 project, I bumped it to 11, and now I'm trying 12.\r\nBut I am having an error from `esbuild`, `Unexpected \"\\xe7\"`,  when `npm run build [or serve]` (see the log bellow).\r\n\r\nI searched for the suspected character \"\\xe7\", and I found \"ç\" (https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+00E7).\r\nI looked for those in the project, and not iteration of it were found in the project (some in the `node_modules`).\r\n\r\nThe odd thing is: It is not working on my dev platform `OS: win32 x64`, but working on GitLab CI `OS: linux x64`\r\n\r\nI tried to update as best as possible, mostly using https://update.angular.io/ , release notes and migration guides (https://v11.angular.io/guide/updating-to-version-11 + https://v12.angular.io/guide/updating-to-version-12).\r\nMaybe I forgot something ?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands

[`v0.15.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0151)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1)\n\n-   Update esbuild's Yarn Plug'n'Play implementation to match the latest specification changes ([#&#8203;2452](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2452), [#&#8203;2453](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2453))\n\n    This release updates esbuild's implementation of Yarn Plug'n'Play to match some changes to Yarn's specification that just landed. The changes are as follows:\n\n    -   Check for platform-specific absolute paths instead of always for the `/` prefix\n\n        The specification previously said that Yarn Plug'n'Play path resolution rules should not apply for paths that start with `/`. The intent was to avoid accidentally processing absolute paths. However, absolute paths on Windows such as `C:\\project` start with drive letters instead of with `/`. So the specification was changed to instead explicitly avoid processing absolute paths.\n\n    -   Make `$$virtual` an alias for `__virtual__`\n\n        Supporting Yarn-style path resolution requires implementing a custom Yarn-specific path traversal scheme where certain path segments are considered no-ops. Specifically any path containing segments of the form `__virtual__/<whatever>/<n>` where `<n>` is an integer must be treated as if they were `n` times the `..` operator instead (the `<whatever>` path segment is ignored). So `/path/to/project/__virtual__/xyz/2/foo.js` maps to the underlying file `/path/to/project/../../foo.js`. This scheme makes it possible for Yarn to get node (and esbuild) to load the same file multiple times (which is sometimes required for correctness) without actually duplicating the file on the file system.\n\n        However, old versions of Yarn used to use `$$virtual` instead of `__virtual__`. This was changed because `$$virtual` was error-prone due to the use of the `$` character, which can cause bugs when it's not correctly escaped within regular expressions. Now that esbuild makes `$$virtual` an alias for `__virtual__`, esbuild should now work with manifests from these old Yarn versions.\n\n    -   Ignore PnP manifests in virtual directories\n\n        The specification describes the algorithm for how to find the Plug'n'Play manifest when starting from a certain point in the file system: search through all parent directories in reverse order until the manifest is found. However, this interacts poorly with virtual paths since it can end up finding a virtual copy of the manifest instead of the original. To avoid this, esbuild now ignores manifests in virtual directories so that the search for the manifest will continue and find the original manifest in another parent directory later on.\n\n    These fixes mean that esbuild's implementation of Plug'n'Play now matches Yarn's implementation more closely, and esbuild can now correctly build more projects that use Plug'n'Play.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.10.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4100-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev493v4100-2022-08-10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.3...v4.10.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   allow to configure more `client` options via resource URL ([#&#8203;4274](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4274)) ([216e3cb](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/216e3cbe62dc90b9345995cb4f33ca9dd7b6aaba))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   response correctly when receive an OPTIONS request ([#&#8203;4185](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4185)) ([2b3b7e0](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/2b3b7e000f688e086c68ba821ed2edc3cd56a219))\n\n##### [4.9.3](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.2...v4.9.3) (2022-06-29)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   avoid creation unnecessary stream for static sockjs file ([#&#8203;4482](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4482)) ([049b153](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/049b153b87ab908ae53b71356e0716bb3fc5bf07))\n-   history-api-fallback now supports HEAD requests and handles them the same as GET ([8936082](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/8936082809a9575f231afbcad6a32bb8e14d6dce))\n\n##### [4.9.2](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.1...v4.9.2) (2022-06-06)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   add `@types/serve-static` to dependencies ([#&#8203;4468](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4468)) ([af83deb](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/af83deb199dc1d8cae4365ec2c5acf07e29358df))\n\n##### [4.9.1](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.0...v4.9.1) (2022-05-31)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   security problem with sockjs ([#&#8203;4465](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4465)) ([e765182](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/e765182e426cbca9c3c09294b02ac2d9737c1d74))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Therefore is my proposal to make the Angular CDK Drag and Drop accessible to everyone! My ideas so far\r\n\r\n- Reusing as much code as possible (maybe renaming the functions if selected)\r\n- Adding aria roles if necessary\r\n- tabindex to all grabbable items\r\n- Space to activate moving by keyboard (than currently doing it by arrow keys with small movement). Ideas: movement to fix containers or movement by bigger steps!\r\n- Escape to quit movement\r\n\r\nFirst Code proposal (Please don't look to specific, is my first proposal, Improvements needed): \r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/commit/1c50475095a7ecf3c1f142c820d3f5a71f0070b8\r\n\r\nIs is meaningful to do more work on it?

previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nv15\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm unable to get an Adobe/typekit CSS stylesheet to embed using an esbuild-based builder configuration.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get it to work with esbuild is to disable font optimization via `projects.PROJECT_NAME.architect.build.configurations.production.optimization.fonts = false` in `angular.json`.  Otherwise, I have to revert back to the `browser` builder.  \r\n\r\nFor now, I'm using the stable `browser` Webpack builder, so that I don't have to muck around with updating configs that may need to be reverted later when we eventually switch to esbuild.  However, the esbuild scripts provide no useful console output or advanced logging to explain _WHY_ it fails, so I have no way to troubleshoot the exact issue.  \r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nGiven that the build script doesn't provide enough detailed information, I can't reliably determine if the issue resides in the build script itself or if it is a result of being behind our corporate firewall/vpn.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, here's how I was able to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n1. Generate a fresh Angular 16 or 17 app using angular CLI\r\n    - CLI v16+ seems to default to the `application` build script\r\n2. `npm install`\r\n3. Check that the production builder is using an esbuild-based script (either `application` or `browser-esbuild`)\r\n4. add an Adobe/typekit css import to your `src/styles.scss`\r\n5. `npm run build`\r\n\r\nFYI: This seems to only be an issue with builders using esbuild. The webpack-based `browser` script still works fine, but doesn't actually inline the CSS file; it just passes through the CSS `@import`, verbatim.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n![Failed to inline external stylesheet](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/545605/d5bd62fc-fea8-45d5-966e-cf873e07a393)\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ npm run build -- --verbose\r\n\r\n> ngapp17@0.0.0 build\r\n> ng build --verbose\r\n\r\n⠋ Building...\r\n\r\n  polyfills-S3BTP7ME.js  33.2kb\r\n\r\n⠏ Building...\r\n\r\n  main-LRVPNULS.js  193.2kb\r\n\r\nApplication bundle generation failed.

This allows for improved warm build times by removing the need to run the Angular linker and build optimizer steps against unchanged third-party code within each build. This does not affect hot rebuilds that would take place during watch mode since the outputs are already cached within memory. The on-disk storage of the cached data is handled by the `lmdb` package which provides fast key/value storage and built-in off-thread compression. This package is currently used by such projects as Gatsby and parcel for their respective caching subsystems.\r\n\r\nWarm production build of a new 18.0.0-rc.2 project with disabled caching:\r\n```\r\nApplication bundle generation complete.

At the same time, any allowlist or source expressions such as 'self' or 'unsafe-inline' will be ignored.\r\n\r\nBased on that documentation I would expect both cases to work. For the esbuild case, we are allowing `main.js` via sha384, which should then be allowed to import further scripts. Is there something I am missing here?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` output\r\n```html\r\n<script\r\n  src=\"runtime.123.js\"\r\n  type=\"module\"\r\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n  integrity=\"sha384-123\"\r\n></script>\r\n<script\r\n  src=\"polyfills.123.js\"\r\n  type=\"module\"\r\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n  integrity=\"sha384-123\"\r\n></script>\r\n<script\r\n  src=\"main.123.js\"\r\n  type=\"module\"\r\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n  integrity=\"sha384-123\"\r\n></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nChrome trace for loading the first chunk\r\n![webpack](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/3266794/70a08573-a83d-4c67-9509-be61aac47b5d)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` output\r\n```html\r\n<script\r\n  src=\"polyfills-123.js\"\r\n  type=\"module\"\r\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n  integrity=\"123\"\r\n></script>\r\n<script\r\n  src=\"main-123.js\"\r\n  type=\"module\"\r\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n  integrity=\"123\"\r\n></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nChrome trace for loading the first chunk\r\n![esbuild](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/3266794/e95ce8b3-48a2-47de-8298-4e199b90cacc)\r\n\r\nChrome console error\r\n```console\r\nRefused to load the script '.../chunk-123.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive:\r\n\"script-src ...

It was previously incorrect due to lack of test coverage. Here's an example of a decorator that doesn't work without this change:\n\n    ```js\n    const dec = () => function() { this.bar = true }\n    class Foo { @&#8203;dec static foo }\n    console.log(Foo.bar) // Should be \"true\"\n    ```\n\n-   Allow `es2023` as a target environment ([#&#8203;3762](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3762))\n\n    TypeScript recently [added `es2023`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58140) as a compilation target, so esbuild now supports this too. There is no difference between a target of `es2022` and `es2023` as far as esbuild is concerned since the 2023 edition of JavaScript doesn't introduce any new syntax features.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n###

this)\n\nℹ️ Important changes added to the `.verdaccio-db.json` and token signature for users that run on Node.js 22 or higher (in the future 🙃 ) please read\nhttps://verdaccio.org/docs/configuration/#.verdaccio-db\n\nTLDR:\n\n-   Enforced for users that runs verdaccio **via npmjs**, for all Docker image isuers, verdaccio uses Node.js LTS 21 and the secret migration is **voluntary** until next major release.\n-   For **Node.js 21** or lower a new *deprecation* will appear `  [VERWAR007] VerdaccioDeprecation: the secret length is too lon... ` to remove it please read the link above\n-   For **Node.js 22** if you have already a storage with `.verdaccio-db.json` and the token inside does not complies with the length (read link above) **the application startup will fail with fatal error (`Error: Invalid storage secret key length, must be 32 characters long but is....`)**\n\nIn both cases by updating the *secret* all previously tokens will get invalid, in your benefit a new legacy signature will be applied and is more secure than the old one (generating tokens with salt).\n\nFor existing installations that have no issues by invalidating tokens is recommended to add to the `config.yaml` the following setup, this will automatically generate a new the secret once is started, could be removed aftewards, if all went succesfull the `[VERWAR007]` deprecation will not be displayed anymore.\n\n```yaml\nsecurity:\n  api:\n    migrateToSecureLegacySignature: true\n```\n\nAny new installation should not worry about this, new token signature and secret (32 characters) is applied by default.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   add property forceMigrateToSecureLegacySignature

(See demo project, which provides architect targets for both builders.)\r\n\r\nUse case: The application imports its styles from a 3rd party SCSS library installed as a dependency, and that library provides SCSS variables for assets, with a default value of a relative path internal to itself.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/daiscog/esbuild-scss-asset-issues/tree/main\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nApplication bundle generation failed.

On the variant that I took as a basis, there is the enter method, which was cut out in new versions of the material and advised to use: _dropListRef, but as a result, when I uncomment the lines in my version from 160 to 162, I get an error about exceeding the call stack, if left commented out, sorting begins to work from the second move, after the first dragging, the element returns to its place. And under any conditions, for some reason, the rearrangement of blocks begins to work after the second tug-of-war.\r\n2. And the second error, if you leave the current option, it begins to work out as described above after we start moving the cell for the second time, and it works only smoothly until the next cell, after the visual starts to glitch and a lot of errors come from ClientRect, although the logic works and the cell will stand where it is translucent, but visually it stops moving.\r\nIf possible, please tell me what the problem might be and how it can be fixed, or maybe you have better examples of how to implement it so that it looks like the first example? Thank you very much in advance.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n I did drag&drop based on the code from this page:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dragdrop-grid?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\nAnd that's what happened:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5mctqa?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations%2C%20@angular/common%2C%20@angular/compiler%2C%20@angular/core%2C%20@angular/forms%2C%20@angular/platform-browser%2C%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic%2C%20@angular/router%2C%20core-js%2C%20rxjs%2C%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fapp%2Fdashboard%2Fdashboard.component.html&template=node&title=Angular%20Starter\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI need to implement drag and drop very similar to the first option.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe elements do not shift after the first drag, there are also a lot of errors in the ClientRect console when dragging to a cell or very often through a cell. There is no error on ClientRect if we dragged the cell, then moved it again on the spot and dropped it. And we start moving one cell at a time, the error sometimes goes away. But after 1 cell it always appears immediately.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17.3.1\r\n- CDK/Material 17.3.1:\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chorme\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):

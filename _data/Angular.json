So, when I close this new page, I could go back to my previous page with everything left as it was.\r\n\r\nYeah, I know that I can save somewhere previous component's state, and re-init with that state data when I come back to that page, but it's not a good solution, here's why:\r\n\r\n1. I cannot always save each state of a components, there might be some pure template (html/css/js, css animations, etc.) related things which I cannot save and re-init with.\r\n\r\n2. Even if I can save each state of a component, it would be huge overhead to always check every time whether I have added this some new state into my state saving mechanism.\r\n\r\n3. There might be really heavy to render components with lot's of initial calculation, so when I needed to switch to a different route for a second (maybe, select something from my list in a different route) and come back, I don't want it to re-render everything.\r\nInstead, I want to keep my prevoius page as it is (like as if I just hide it) when I want to open some different, and want to come back in a second. And, maybe come back with some data even (but this is another feature..)\r\n\r\nSome real-world scenarios:\r\n\r\nWhile I am filling a hude Form, I need to fill select input, when I couldn't find proper item from a select input dropdown, I would want to add this item into that entity which should be done in a totally different route, so if I could open that route as a dialog* (page dialog - this is a name of my requesting feature), I wouldn't need to save everything on this page into some service, I would just add my new item and continue filling my form in my previous page.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAs a solution, I think, I need some directive to use with routeLink, like: routerLinkAsDialog maybe. So, when I set this to true, I want Angular not to destroy my current component, and open new route component on the top of my current component. When I close that new page (with selecting something, or by saving something) I want to come to my last active page.\r\n\r\nIt is going to look like having layers of pages which are alive, so, when I close one, the last one going to open, etc.\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAlternattive considerations would be the ability to access data of my active pages. However, it is not that critical feature to have.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55207","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Optionally keeping previous Component non-destroyed while routing to a new Component\" (#55207)"},{"Id":"2224132083","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-03T23:49:56","Actor":"SimonCropp","Number":"55206","RawContent":null,"Title":"update vite to 5.1.7 to avoid CVE","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8jhw-289h-jh2g\r\n\r\nthis is my first PR to angular. and my first time playing with yarn.

In the places I am having issues is when I need to run code when inputs change. For structural directives, akin to `*ngIf`, I need to call `createEmbeddedView` when one or more `input` values change. For components, I may need to invoke methods on services and therefore there is no local caller of the value (like the template using an input and therefore `computed` could be used for affected code as well).\r\n\r\nIn these case, `effect` does work, but the problem is that child components will have been initialized and executed **before** the parent effect runs. To be able to go fully signal-based, I'm trying avoid using `ngOnInit` or `ngOnChanges`\r\n\r\nOne work-around seems to be to use `computed` and invoke the computed method during `ngOnInit` as an alternative to using `effect` to ensure the code is run before children components are initialized.\r\n\r\nOriginally I posted this as a question at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78213307/passing-an-angular-signal-value-from-a-component-input-into-a-service\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hjmcgz?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\nIn this stack blitz application, if you open the developer tools console, you will see that the child components will get no value for `b` and `d`. `b` is a property on a provider that is set by the top level component in an `effect`. `d` is the same but uses `toObservable` instead of `effect`. In both of these use cases, the child component is initialized and rendered in what could be an invalid state. \r\n\r\nI am not seeing a way without using `ngOnInit` or `ngOnChanges` to get the desired behavior of responding to `input` signal changes and perform logic that must be run before children components are initialized.\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.1\r\nNode: 18.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: pnpm 8.6.12\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: undefined\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1703.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core         17.3.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   17.3.1\r\n@schematics/angular          17.3.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n \r\nThis may not be a \"bug\", but I'm not seeing any best practices, documentation, or discussions that show how to work-around this behavior change from using `ngOnChanges` to non-template based changes that need to occur before children components are initialized.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55202","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Effect usage causes undesirable changes in behavior to existing components due to timing\" (#55202)"},{"Id":"2223656735","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-03T18:46:01","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"55200","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: remove event-dispatch in pullapprove","State":"closed","Body":"patch does not include event-dispatch paths, which was causing pullapprove to fail.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] CI related changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55200","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: remove event-dispatch in pullapprove\" (#55200)"},{"Id":"2223661283","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-03T18:44:17","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55201","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): include filepath for `DocEntry`","State":"open","Body":"This is to allow the API docs to provide a direct link to implementation on github.\r\n\r\nHere is a screen of what info we get. \r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-03 at 22 04 23](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/1300985/92a29376-580b-491e-be44-d0ff5d44e521)\r\n\r\n\r\nvs what aio provides: https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/17.3.2/packages/common/src/pipes/date_pipe.ts#L60-L281 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55201","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): include filepath for `DocEntry`\" (#55201)"},{"Id":"2223621778","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-03T18:27:48","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"55199","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: fixes jsaction path name","State":"closed","Body":"This updates the jsaction path to be event-dispatch.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] CI related changes\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55199","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: fixes jsaction path name\" (#55199)"},{"Id":"2223569519","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-03T18:08:19","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"55197","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove unnecessary folder","State":"closed","Body":"This removes a temporary folder for jsaction.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Other...

However I think it is valid to use the `ChangeDetectorRef` inside a pipe. In the end this is also what the `async` pipe does under the hood.\r\n\r\n@pkozlowski-opensource mentioned that we should not mock framework internals for our own test. Generally I think this is a good thing, but I could also see how someone wants to ensure that some critical `markForCheck` is guaranteed to be there.  This could be easily achieved by mocking the `cdr` and writing a test that the method is called.\r\n\r\nThe second point here is that if you do not mock the `ChangeDetectorRef` your test will fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[DemoPipe -> ChangeDetectorRef -> ChangeDetectorRef]: \r\n  NullInjectorError: No provider for ChangeDetectorRef!\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created a small reproduction example which I pushed here: https://github.com/kreuzerk/effect-test-pipe\r\n\r\nThe error can be reproduced with the following steps:\r\n- Checkout repo\r\n- npm i\r\n- npm run test\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kreuzerk/effect-test-pipe\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nWhen mocking the `ChangeDetectorRef` you get this error:\r\n\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do not mock the `ChangeDetectorRef` you get this error\r\n```\r\nNullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[DemoPipe -> ChangeDetectorRef -> ChangeDetectorRef]: \r\n  NullInjectorError: No provider for ChangeDetectorRef!```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.3\r\nAngular: 17.3.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55191","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unit test fails for Pipes that use an effect and inject ChangeDetectorRef\" (#55191)"},{"Id":"2223046005","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-03T14:07:36","Actor":"johnnygerard","Number":"55193","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(common): invalid ImageKit quality parameter","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The reason that I use this `deployUrl` is it provides a lot of benefit to deploy application to different places (servers) with different path of JS and CSS files. I'd had not faced this issue with version 10. In this version 16, I got many errors in the log. The error looks like this below.\r\n\r\n`Unable to locate stylesheet: /dist/apps/{appName}/browser/{appName}/styles.ab877c333925063d.css`\r\n\r\n\r\nTo disable this error, I tried to set this `inlineCriticalCss` with `false` value in `server.ts` file, but the problem is the page got flicker with blue links which caught user attention. I must force to remove this `inlineCriticalCss` and leave the log in the console.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`\r\n...\r\nserver.engine(\r\n    'html',\r\n    ngExpressEngine({\r\n      bootstrap: AppServerModule,\r\n      providers: [\r\n        { provide: 'someToken', useFactory: () => tokenData, deps: [] },\r\n      ],\r\n      inlineCriticalCss: false\r\n    })\r\n);\r\n...\r\n`\r\nThe log on this error kept increasing every day.

the injector heirarchy of the routes and never inherit from\n    the `RouterOutlet`. This means that providers available only to the\n    component that defines the `RouterOutlet` will no longer be available to\n    route components in any circumstances. This was already the case\n    whenever routes defined providers, either through lazy loading an\n    `NgModule` or through explicit `providers` on the route config.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit |

I have newest version (17.3.2) but I see my buttons in old (m2) way. After inspecting the styles, it seems variables are taken from predefined themes with (for example) old border radius value:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/8963600/dc2219b5-6cfa-4160-b688-91de4563168a)\r\nvs\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/8963600/30a91ea1-32e1-473e-89a7-32389e3acfc3)\r\n\r\nI found out I need to follow this page to be able to implement m3 styles properly (with usage of material-experimental) https://material.angular.io/guide/material-3 but there's no obvious way to apply it from the button's page code overview https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview\r\n\r\nI checked stackblitz example for buttons that you present and it seems there's a needed dependency on material-experimental in order to be working properly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/8963600/6a14037e-16ec-458f-b68e-bab93734a764)\r\n\r\nSo I'd suggest to put some switch in docs between m2 and m3 appearances, so it's clear what is what. It seems docs are now exclusively m3 and what was before about copy'n'paste of piece of code is now about wandering through docs and finding out you need to actually install material-experimental to make it look like it. Because by default m2 styles are used but they're no more shown in the docs.\r\n\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/button/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28808","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"docs-bug(Button): For m3 buttons there's a needed dependency on material-experimental?\" (#28808)"},{"Id":"2220439372","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-02T12:47:49","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"28809","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(button): add support for filled tonal button same as in M3 spec","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nhttps://m3.material.io/components/buttons/guidelines#07a1577b-aaf5-4824-a698-03526421058b\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/25394362/06bdb8b5-e8fb-4639-a9ad-026562f0176a)\r\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28809","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(button): add support for filled tonal button same as in M3 spec\" (#28809)"},{"Id":"2220109642","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-02T10:14:12","Actor":"msftedad","Number":"28807","RawContent":null,"Title":"Non-text contrast ratio between keyboard focus and background of 'Edit' button is less than required 3:1 ratio.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nUsers with limited visions will not be able to see the focus between keyboard focus and background on 'Edit' clearly.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

I thought there was no `tabindex` until I found this comment which obiously said you can acces it through `[tabIndex]` https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20883#issuecomment-744759846.\r\n\r\nNow the first question: is it expected to have no mentions of the `tabIndex` in the documentation? Because there is already the `id` and `value` inputs for example and I believe the `tabIndex` could be there too. Also apprently I'm not the only one on the internet struggling knowing it exists. I think it could be a good addition to the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you think it makes totally sense ðŸŽ‰I'm super motivated to update the repository to see them. I already checked in the source code that all these components have a tabindex input:\r\n* button\r\n* checkbox\r\n* chips\r\n* datepicker\r\n* expansion-panel\r\n* radio\r\n* select\r\n* slide-toggle\r\n* tab\r\n* tree\r\nI also have the feeling that the documentation uses the comments from [angular/component](https://github.com/angular/component) and is generated in [angular/material.angular.io](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io). So I have the feeling I only need to update angular/component. As far as I understand there is already comments above the `tabIndex` input so it should be visible in the documentation. \r\n\r\nIf angular/component seems OK I was wondering maybe in angular/material.angular.io there is some filtering that ignores `tabIndex` but no mentions at all about `tabIndex` so I have the feeling that our problem doesn't lay there.\r\n\r\nLast point, in the API Report File for \"components-srcs\" I can see some attributes with `// (undocumented)` comment above. These attributes aren't visible in the documentation. But still, the `tabIndex` don't have this kind of comment above.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to fix this problem myself but it would be nice if someone could give me some hints on where to look. It would save me some time :)\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttp://localhost:4200/components/chips/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): Tabindex is missing in the documentation\" (#28793)"},{"Id":"2213590003","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T16:01:06","Actor":"XavierDupessey","Number":"28792","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk/drag-drop): DRAG AND DROP SELECTING TEXT WITH SHADOW DOM ENCAPSULATION ON FIREFOX","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with Drag and Drop examples from https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview when a parent component is encapsulated with Shadow DOM **on Firefox**: it selects text of other elements (cf video).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/assets/1449888/2273a28d-637c-4a55-bb85-bfcfed87119c\r\n\r\nI tested it with the \"Drag&Drop connected sorting\" example from version 14 to 17.\r\nThe bug exists in all versions (I did not try older versions).\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nXavier\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link (under v14): https://stackblitz.com/edit/gszzna?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-drag-drop-connected-sorting-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

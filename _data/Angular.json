This wasn't ideal as I am using the new Sass module only available in dart-sass.\r\n\r\nThe bug is caused by first checking for node-sass. This problem can be fixed by instead checking for the sass package (as it's the newer alternative from the perspective of the CLI), then falling back to node-sass if sass isn't present.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/styles.ts#L125-L131\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nReproduced by having node-sass present in your node_modules.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nErrors related to having node-sass try to compile Sass 1.23.0 code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-next.6\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-next.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.0-next.6\r\n@angular/cdk                       8.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                       9.0.0-next.6\r\n@angular/material                  8.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.0-next.6\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.0-next.6\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.0-next.6\r\nng-packagr                         5.5.1\r\nrxjs                               6.5.3\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.41.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

To do so, I need to host the code on Google Appsscript.\r\n\r\nTo try and do that, I created an angular project, ran:\r\n```bash\r\nng build  --prod --output-hashing none\r\nmkdir appsscript\r\ncd appsscript\r\nclasp login # Login to your Google account\r\nclasp create \"angular\"\r\ncp -a ../dist/. . # Copy dist files to appsscript project\r\nclasp push\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I get errors from appsscript like:\r\n> Syntax error: Missing ; before statement. line: 1 file: appsscript/main-es2015\r\n\r\nor\r\n> Syntax error: Property \"useDeprecatedSynchronousErrorHandling\" already defined in this object literal. line: 1 file: appsscript/main-es5\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich as far as I understand, means that appsscript thinks this compiled code is not strict enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nA build option with \"strict\" output code\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI've tried to compile to ES3, which is a JS version that appsscript should be able to analyze (although I'm running this in the browser eventually), \r\nBut I get:\r\n>  'Syntax error: Invalid property ID. line: 133 file: sheets/main',\r\n\r\nwhich refers to this part of the code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5757359/66480565-a29ac200-eaa7-11e9-9106-b8b49420021b.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15799","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat-fix(appsScript): builds do not support appsscript deployment\" (#15799)"},{"Id":"504494978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-09T08:28:59","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15795","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): add migration to add new i18n options for Ivy","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis migration will update current projects by adding the `i18n` project level option and add `localize` option in the server and browser builder configurations when both `i18nLocale` and `i18nFile` are defined.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15795","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): add migration to add new i18n options for Ivy\" (#15795)"},{"Id":"504490450","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-09T08:21:59","Actor":"damiancyk","Number":"15794","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERROR in ./node_modules/ngb-modal-draggable/index.ts     ","State":"closed","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\nERROR in ./node_modules/ngb-modal-draggable/index.ts                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Module build failed (from ./node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/index.js):                                                                                                                                                                                                        Error: C:\\project\\node_modules\\ngb-modal-draggable\\index.ts is missing from the TypeScript compilation.

I am trying to reduce first load time of this app by reducing the size of` main.js`. I removed all declarations and imports from `AppModule `except `AppComponent `and served the app. This gave me a main.js of size 367kb.\r\nI tried using `webpack-bundle-analyser` and here is the results for `main.js`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"github\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16303528/65390882-2e121480-dd80-11e9-8327-9a7d97d49586.png\">\r\n\r\nI have been struggling with this issue with the last 10 months. I have wasted countless hours and tried and given up many times. I have posted on Reddit about it but no help.

This works for both AOT and JIT mode.\r\n\r\nWith Ivy enabled this is **not** the case, the component is NOT part of the final bundle, despite the fact that it is referenced as an entry component.\r\nIn JIT mode the component is included, in AOT mode it is not.\r\n\r\nFor my usecase this is a problem because I am attaching a custom decorator to the component and I expect this decorator to execute when the module is loaded. This in turn is done to be able to dynamically instantiate these components without having to reference them explicitly, the custom decorator registers the components.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.5\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.5\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I would like to have this property public, or made accessible with a method instead of typing the following code that would break without any warning should the property change name : `(dragRef as any)._pickupPositionInElement`\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nTo create a custom control, I need to be able to drag items, and snap them to a \"container\". Dragged items are above the container, with a `position: absolute` styling. For that, I only use the `cdkDrag` directive, and the `cdkDragConstrainPosition` input.\r\nIn the method, I then search for the container-column to snap to, and return its position + the pickup position in element. If I don't add the pickup position, then the element does not snap as it should : I want the top left corner of the dragged element to be snapped to the top left corner of the column.\r\n\r\nI created a stackblitz to show exactly what I am talking about : [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-wm4ugv)\r\nUse the slider to toggle On/Off the use of `_pickupPositionInElement` and see that, when toggled off, the dragged element snaps based on where the drag has began (which is wrong for my use case). When toggled On, everything runs as it should. It is just that the ` as any` cast makes changes to the DragRef interface a potential invisible and undetectable breaking change for me…\r\n\r\nThanks for reading me and have a nice day!\r\nCheers.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17353","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Cdk drag-drop] Expose dragRef._pickupPositionInElement\" (#17353)"},{"Id":"505093193","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T07:38:31","Actor":"acalvo","Number":"17352","RawContent":null,"Title":"Autocomplete dropdown opened after losing focus","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

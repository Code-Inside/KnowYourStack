However, after upgrading to Angular v18, the build now produces a large number of small initial chunks. This was not an issue before, and seems to significantly affect performance due to increased number of HTTP requests and potential blocking.\n\nThis issue is not related to lazy-loaded modules — these are initial (eager) chunks that should ideally be bundled more efficiently.\n\n<img width=\"1466\" height=\"649\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf7303cc-4a8a-48db-8b40-038194dc247a\" />\n\n\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nAngular should produce a smaller number of optimized initial chunks, similar to how it behaved in Angular 14\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Start with an Angular 14 project with default configuration.\n2. Upgrade to Angular 18 and switch to the ESBuild-based application builder (default in v18).\n3. Run ng build in production mode.\n4. Observe the number of initial chunks generated.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.19\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.13\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.13\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.19\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.19\n@angular/cdk                    18.2.14\n@angular/cli                    18.2.19\n@angular/google-maps            18.2.14\n@angular/material               18.2.14\n@schematics/angular             18.2.19\nng-packagr                      18.2.1\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.4.5\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n- Angular version: 18\n- CLI builder: @angular-devkit/build-angular using ESBuild\n- Target: Production\n- Browser builder previously used: Webpack (v14)\n\n\nThere does not seem to be a documented or supported way to merge or reduce these chunks in the ESBuild configuration.\nThis could impact app performance and scalability, especially on mobile or low-bandwidth networks.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30778","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 18 build with ESBuild generates excessive number of initial chunks after migration from v14\" (#30778)"},{"Id":"3258510092","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T05:08:28","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30776","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.29.4","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.29.3` -> `v3.29.4` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.29.4`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v3.29.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.29.3...v3.29.4)\n\n##### CodeQL Action Changelog\n\nSee the [releases page](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases) for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.\n\n##### 3.29.4 - 23 Jul 2025\n\nNo user facing changes.\n\nSee the full [CHANGELOG.md](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/v3.29.4/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

*/\n```\n\nAs you can see `userRoutes` depends on `authGuard` to be set however it's declared later in the chunk file leading to the angular router throwing an Exception because undefined was passed instead of a canActivate guard.\n\nThis is an abbreviated version of the original source file:\n```ts\nimport { Routes as NgRoutes } from '@angular/router';\nimport { authGuard } from '../../shared/guards/auth-guard';\n\nexport const USER_ROUTES_PREFIX = 'user';\n\nexport const UserRoutes = {\n  PROFILE: [USER_ROUTES_PREFIX, 'profile'],\n  SETTINGS: [USER_ROUTES_PREFIX, 'settings'],\n};\n\nexport const userRoutes: NgRoutes = [\n  {\n    path: UserRoutes.PROFILE.join('/'),\n    loadComponent: () =>\n      import('../pages/user-profile-page/user-profile-page').then(m => m.UserProfilePage),\n    canActivate: [authGuard],\n  },\n  {\n    path: UserRoutes.SETTINGS.join('/'),\n    loadComponent: () =>\n      import('../pages/user-settings-page/user-settings-page').then(m => m.UserSettingsPage),\n    canActivate: [authGuard],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nAs you can see it's being imported correctly and should therefore be declared before the user routes in the chunk file.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you

However, this creates problems regarding WCAG compliance and accessibility.\n\nAccording to the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), **tree structures can be used for page navigation** as demonstrated in the [Treeview Navigation Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/examples/treeview-navigation/). The guidelines specify that:\n\n1. `aria-current=\"page\"` should be used (instead of `aria-selected`) to indicate the current page\n2. Navigation should be implemented using `<a>` tags\n\nAngular Material however enforces this default role structure:\nmat-tree → role=\"tree\"\nmat-nested-tree-node → role=\"treeitem\"\n\n...there is an issue when trying to use semantically correct links (`<a>` tags) within `<mat-nested-tree-node>` – for example, with aria-current=\"page\".\n\nWhen we intend to use the `<mat-tree>` component as a recursive tree-based site navigation, the question becomes how to correctly integrate and semantically mark up an `<a>` tag. Ideally, the `<a>` tag itself should receive the role=\"treeitem\" and the aria-current=\"page\" attribute when it represents the current page.\n\nCurrently, it's unclear to us how the `<mat-tree>` component can be extended to meet this specific requirement for web links.\n\nRemoving the `<a>` tag and replacing it with manual navigation (this.router.navigate()) is not an option due to synchronization problems etc.\n\nThe following code snippet shows our current approach:\n```\n<mat-tree [dataSource]=\"treeDataSource\" [treeControl]=\"treeControl\" class=\"nested-tree\">\n  <mat-nested-tree-node [attr.aria-current]=\"linkActive.isActive ? 'page' : null\"\n    *matTreeNodeDef=\"let item; when: hasChild\">\n    <div\n      class=\"mat-tree-node\"\n      matTreeNodeToggle\n      routerLinkActive=\"menu-nav--highlighted\"\n      [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{ exact: true }\"\n      #linkActive=\"routerLinkActive\">\n        <button mat-mini-fab color=\"light\" [attr.aria-label]=\"'toggle ' + item.title\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n          <mat-icon [svgIcon]=\"treeControl.isExpanded(item) ? 'arrow-down-20' : 'arrow-right-20'\">\n          </mat-icon>\n        </button>\n      <a\n        class=\"menu-nav__link tree-node-link\"\n        [routerLink]=\"item.route\"\n        tabindex=\"-1\"\n        [attr.aria-label]=\"item.title\"\n        [attr.title]=\"item.title\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        (click)=\"onNodeToggle($event, item)\">\n        {{ item.title }}\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div [ngClass]=\"{ hidden: !treeControl.isExpanded(item) }\" role=\"group\">\n      <ng-container matTreeNodeOutlet></ng-container>\n    </div>\n  </mat-nested-tree-node>\n</mat-tree>\n```\nI would appreciate an official way or best practice to semantically implement accessible links with aria-current inside the **mat-tree** pattern.\n\nThank you in advance for any feedback or proposed solutions!\n\n\n### Use Case\n\nA way to configure **mat-tree** so that:\n\n1. Links are correctly identified as treeitem\n2. aria-current=\"page\" can be set for the current page\n3.

The `multi: true` option is not missing or mistakenly added\r\n\r\nFor libraries, in order to ensure type-safe providing, it has been a common pattern to create `provideXxx` helpers. However, in daily application development, the providng experience is still non-type-safe.\r\n\r\nSince all the `ProviderToken`s carry type information, it is possible to create framework-level providing helpers to ensure type safety.\r\n\r\nI have created such helper functions and fully adopted it in all my projects.  \r\nI would like to create a PR to introduce these helpers to `@angular/core` to enable a safer providing experience for all Angular developers.\r\n\r\nPlease see below for details.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n## Signatures\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction provide<T, U extends T>(config: ProvideConfig<T, U>): Provider;\r\nfunction provideMulti<T>(config: ProvideMultiConfig<T>): Provider;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprovide({ token: TitleStrategy, useClass: AppTitleStrategy });\r\nprovide({ token: TitleStrategy, useExisting: AppTitleStrategy });\r\n// `AppTitleStrategy` have to be assignable to `TitleStrategy`.\r\n\r\ndeclare const SNACKBAR_CONFIG: InjectionToken<SnackbarConfig>;\r\nprovide({ token: SNACKBAR_CONFIG, useValue: { ... } });\r\n// Type of `useValue` is inferred as `SnackbarConfig`, enabling autocomplete.\r\n\r\ndeclare const BREAKPOINTS: InjectionToken<BreakpointMap>\r\nprovide({ token: BREAKPOINTS, useFactory: (observer = inject(BreakpointObserver)) => observer.observe() });\r\n// Return type of the factory has to match `BreakpointMap`\r\n\r\nprovide({ token: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: () => () => {} });\r\n// Type error. APP_INITIALIZER should be an array of functions, but the return type of the factory is a single function.\r\n// Type '() => void' is not assignable to type 'readonly (() => void | Observable<unknown> | Promise<unknown>)[]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprovideMulti({ token: TitleStrategy, useClass: AppTitleStrategy });\r\n// Type error. TitleStrategy does not support multi providing.\r\n// Argument of type '{ token: typeof TitleStrategy; useClass: typeof AppTitleStrategy; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.\r\n\r\nprovideMulti({ token: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: () => () => {} });\r\n// Legit. The return type of the factory matches the item type of APP_INITIALIZER\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function provide<T, U extends T>(config: ProvideConfig<T, U>): Provider {\r\n  if ('useValue' in config)\r\n    return { provide: config.token, useValue: config.useValue };\r\n  if ('useFactory' in config)\r\n    return { provide: config.token, useFactory: config.useFactory };\r\n  if ('useClass' in config)\r\n    return { provide: config.token, useClass: config.useClass };\r\n  if ('useExisting' in config)\r\n    return { provide: config.token, useExisting: config.useExisting };\r\n  throw new Error('Invalid config'); // impossible to happen\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function provideMulti<T>(config: ProvideMultiConfig<T>): Provider {\r\n  return {\r\n    ...provide(config as ProvideConfig<any>),\r\n    multi: true,\r\n  } as Provider;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport type ProvideConfig<T, U extends T = T> = ProvideConfigToken<T> &\r\n  ProvideConfigUse<U>;\r\n\r\nexport type ProvideMultiConfig<T> = ProvideConfigToken<T> &\r\n  (T extends readonly (infer I)[] ? ProvideConfigUse<I> : never);\r\n\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigToken<T> {\r\n  token: ProviderToken<T>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport type ProvideConfigUse<T> =\r\n  | ProvideConfigUseValue<T>\r\n  | ProvideConfigUseFactory<T>\r\n  | ProvideConfigUseClass<T>\r\n  | ProvideConfigUseExisting<T>;\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigUseValue<T> {\r\n  useValue: T;\r\n}\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigUseFactory<T> {\r\n  useFactory: () => T;\r\n}\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigUseClass<T> {\r\n  useClass: Type<T>;\r\n}\r\nexport interface ProvideConfigUseExisting<T> {\r\n  useExisting: ProviderToken<T>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55555","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature] Introduce Type-safe Token Providing\" (#55555)"},{"Id":"2264641351","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-25T23:12:15","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"55554","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): link errors to ADEV","State":"open","Body":"Console error links will now point to adev.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55554","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): link errors to ADEV\" (#55554)"},{"Id":"2264597916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-25T22:30:25","Actor":"guiseek","Number":"55552","RawContent":null,"Title":"Form input mask provided by the framework","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n@angular/forms\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nExcept for tiny apps, practically all others need to mask form inputs, such as currency, phone number, identity documents, etc.\r\n\r\nthe framework could offer this feature and help teams stop wasting time choosing third-party libraries, as few actually do a good job, in addition to many of them abandoning the project and contributing to the project becoming legacy\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt could be a directive within the @angular/forms package.

previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a monorepo setup using npm workspaces, with `/app` containing the Angular application and `/common` containing some common classes, interfaces etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Angular app, in the `tsconfig` I have common set up as a project reference, and this is then made accessible within my angular code by a typical module reference (`@myorg/common`).\r\n\r\nWhen serving my app, I have typescript set up to watch any changes in the `/common` folder and rebuild, and before switching to the new Vite-based dev server this all worked fine: when doing an `ng serve`, then modifying a class in common, the app would be reloaded with the latest code.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the new server, because Vite caches node modules in `.angular/cache/v17.2.0/vite/deps`, and only refreshes it on package-lock changes, its caching my symlinked common module, and then ignoring any changes I make. Not only does this mean is not live reloading, but on subsequent runs, unless I modify the package lock or remove the cache, it will use a stale version of my common module.\r\n\r\nIn a pure Vite scenario, this would be resolved by adding a `vite.config.ts` file like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default {\r\n  optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@myorg/common'] }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've read several threads where modifying the Vite config doesn't seem to be possible or on the roadmap for the dev server, so I'm not sure how else I'm supposed to resolve this without disabling the cache entirely through `angular.json`, which removes a lot of the performance benefits. Appreciate any help!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create top-level npm workspace `package.json`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"repro\",\r\n  \"workspaces\": [\r\n    \"app\",\r\n    \"common\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. `mkdir app && mkdir common`\r\n3. Create a basic typescript library in `common` with a `package.json` and a basic class\r\n4. `cd app && ng new`\r\n5. Modify tsconfig to have project reference to common:\r\n```json\r\n\"references\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"path\": \"../common\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n6. Import the library class in the app component and use it\r\n7. Within `/common`, run `tsc -w` in one shell and keep running\r\n8. Within `/app`, run `ng serve`\r\n9.

eg `child = viewChild<ChildComponent>('someTplVariable')` the `@defer` behavior breaks and the deferred component bundle is not extracted as a lazy loaded bundle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (also

2. after 3 seconds, no additional bundle will be loaded  after 3 seconds (network tab)\r\n\r\n  3. remove the generic type from view child\r\n  4. save and refresh the opened tab\r\n  5. the child bundle will be loaded after 3 seconds (network tab)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n\r\nUsing the deferred component class **only as a generic type** will work with `@defer`\r\n\r\n### Please provide

Depending on supported browsers, Angular will automatically polyfill and transform certain JavaScript and CSS features to ensure the built application does not use a feature which has not been implemented by a supported browser.\r\n\r\nAngular V8 used to add core-js polyfills automatically according to StackOverflow discussions at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56892243/is-not-core-js-needed-anymore:\r\n\r\n> The difference with core-js in ng8 is that, since the CLI is handling polyfills, core-js is a dependency of the CLI. So even if you uninstall core-js as part of upgrading to ng8, you'll see it's still in your node_modules folder, but you won't have to manage which version is installed.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently no core-js dependencies are found and also no core-js polyfills are automatically added. Angular CLI uses `@babel/preset-env` when building Angular applicaitons, which has [built-in support of automatic polyfilling based on core-js](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins), but this feature is not enabled:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c7205ea182f6c38231ce8fe8ab358dc7eab58d65/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/babel/presets/application.ts#L215-L224\n\n###

[`v18.0.0`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1800-2024-05-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/18.0.0-rc.3...18.0.0)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### animations\n\n-   Deprecated `matchesElement` method has been removed from `AnimationDriver` as it is unused.\n\n##### common\n\n-   The deprecated `isPlatformWorkerUi` and `isPlatformWorkerApp` have been removed without replacement, as they serve no purpose since the removal of the WebWorker platform.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   Angular only supports writable expressions inside of two-way bindings.\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n-   -   Angular no longer supports TypeScript versions older than 5.4.\n\n##### core\n\n-   `OnPush` views at the root of the application need to\n    be marked dirty for their host bindings to refresh. Previously, the host\n    bindings were refreshed for all root views without respecting the\n    `OnPush` change detection strategy.\n-   `OnPush` views at the root of the application need to\n    be marked dirty for their host bindings to refresh. Previously, the host\n    bindings were refreshed for all root views without respecting the\n    `OnPush` change detection strategy.\n-   The `ComponentFixture` `autoDetect` feature will no\n    longer refresh the component's host view when the component is `OnPush`\n    and not marked dirty. This exposes existing issues in components which\n    claim to be `OnPush` but do not correctly call `markForCheck` when they\n    need to be refreshed. If this change causes test failures, the easiest\n    fix is to change the component to `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default`.\n-   `ComponentFixture.whenStable` now matches the\n    `ApplicationRef.isStable` observable. Prior to this change, stability\n    of the fixture did not include everything that was considered in\n    `ApplicationRef`. `whenStable` of the fixture will now include unfinished\n    router navigations and unfinished `HttpClient` requests. This will cause\n    tests that `await` the `whenStable` promise to time out when there are\n    incomplete requests. To fix this, remove the `whenStable`,\n    instead wait for another condition, or ensure `HttpTestingController`\n    mocks responses for all requests. Try adding `HttpTestingController.verify()`\n    before your `await fixture.whenStable` to identify the open requests.\n    Also, make sure your tests wait for the stability promise. We found many\n    examples of tests that did not, meaning the expectations did not execute\n    within the test body.\n\n    In addition, `ComponentFixture.isStable` would synchronously switch to\n    true in some scenarios but will now always be asynchronous.\n-   Angular will ensure change detection runs, even when the state update originates from\n    outside the zone, tests may observe additional rounds of change\n    detection compared to the previous behavior.\n\n    This change will be more likely to impact existing unit tests.\n    This should usually be seen as more correct and the test should be updated,\n    but in cases where it is too much effort to debug, the test can revert to the old behavior by adding\n    `provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\n    to the `TestBed` providers.\n\n    Similarly, applications which may want to update state outside the zone\n    and *not* trigger change detection can add\n    `provideZoneChangeDetection({schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly})`\n    to the providers in `bootstrapApplication` or add\n    `schedulingMode: NgZoneSchedulingMode.NgZoneOnly` to the\n    `BootstrapOptions` of `bootstrapModule`.\n-   When Angular runs change detection, it will continue to\n    refresh any views attached to `ApplicationRef` that are still marked for\n    check after one round completes. In rare cases, this can result in infinite\n    loops when certain patterns continue to mark views for check using\n    `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges`. This will be surfaced as a runtime\n    error with the `NG0103` code.\n-   `async` has been removed, use `waitForAsync` instead.\n-   The `ComponentFixture.autoDetect` feature now executes\n    change detection for the fixture within `ApplicationRef.tick`. This more\n    closely matches the behavior of how a component would refresh in\n    production. The order of component refresh in tests may be slightly\n    affected as a result, especially when dealing with additional components\n    attached to the application, such as dialogs. Tests sensitive to this\n    type of change (such as screenshot tests) may need to be updated.\n    Concretely, this change means that the component will refresh *before*\n    additional views attached to `ApplicationRef` (i.e. dialog components).\n    Prior to this change, the fixture component would refresh *after* other\n    views attached to the application.\n-   The exact timing of change detection execution when\n    using event or run coalescing with `NgZone` is now the first of either\n    `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame`. Code which relies on this\n    timing (usually by accident) will need to be adjusted. If a callback\n    needs to execute after change detection, we recommend `afterNextRender`\n    instead of something like `setTimeout`.\n-   Newly created and views marked for check and reattached\n    during change detection are now guaranteed to be refreshed in that same\n    change detection cycle. Previously, if they were attached at a location\n    in the view tree that was already checked, they would either throw\n    `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` or not be refreshed until\n    some future round of change detection. In rare circumstances, this\n    correction can cause issues. We identified one instance that relied on\n    the previous behavior by reading a value on initialization which was\n    queued to be updated in a microtask instead of being available in the\n    current change detection round. The component only read this value during\n    initialization and did not read it again after the microtask updated it.\n-   Testability methods `increasePendingRequestCount`,\n    `decreasePendingRequestCount` and `getPendingRequestCount` have been\n    removed. This information is tracked with zones.\n\n##### http\n\n-   By default we now prevent caching of HTTP requests that require authorization . To opt-out from this behaviour use the `includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders` option in `withHttpTransferCache`.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```ts\n    withHttpTransferCache({\n      includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders: true,\n    })\n    ```\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   Deprecated `StateKey`, `TransferState` and `makeStateKey` have been removed from `@angular/platform-browser`, use the same APIs from `@angular/core`.\n\n##### platform-browser-dynamic\n\n-   No longer used `RESOURCE_CACHE_PROVIDER` APIs have been removed.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   deprecated `platformDynamicServer` has been removed. Add an `import @&#8203;angular/compiler` and replace the usage with `platformServer`\n-   deprecated `ServerTransferStateModule` has been removed. `TransferState` can be use without providing this module.\n-   deprecated `useAbsoluteUrl` and `baseUrl` been removed from `PlatformConfig`. Provide and absolute `url` instead.\n-   Legacy handling or Node.js URL parsing has been removed from `ServerPlatformLocation`.\n\n    The main differences are;\n\n    -   `pathname` is always suffixed with a `/`.\n    -   `port` is empty when `http:` protocol and port in url is `80`\n    -   `port` is empty when `https:` protocol and port in url is `443`\n\n##### router\n\n-   Guards can now return `RedirectCommand` for redirects\n    in addition to `UrlTree`. Code which expects only `boolean` or `UrlTree`\n    values in `Route` types will need to be adjusted.\n-   This change allows `Route.redirectTo` to be a function\n    in addition to the previous string. Code which expects `redirectTo` to\n    only be a string on `Route` objects will need to be adjusted.\n-   When a a guard returns a `UrlTree` as a redirect, the\n    redirecting navigation will now use `replaceUrl` if the initial\n    navigation was also using the `replaceUrl` option. If this is not\n    desirable, the redirect can configure new `NavigationBehaviorOptions` by\n    returning a `RedirectCommand` with the desired options instead of `UrlTree`.\n-   Providers available to the routed components always\n    come from the injector heirarchy of the routes and never inherit from\n    the `RouterOutlet`. This means that providers available only to the\n    component that defines the `RouterOutlet` will no longer be available to\n    route components in any circumstances. This was already the case\n    whenever routes defined providers, either through lazy loading an\n    `NgModule` or through explicit `providers` on the route config.\n-   Providers available to the routed components always\n    come from the injector heirarchy of the routes and never inherit from\n    the `RouterOutlet`.

This was already the case\n    whenever routes defined providers, either through lazy loading an\n    `NgModule` or through explicit `providers` on the route config.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### common\n\n-   `getCurrencySymbol`, `getLocaleCurrencyCode`, `getLocaleCurrencyName`, `getLocaleCurrencySymbol`, `getLocaleDateFormat`, `getLocaleDateTimeFormat`, `getLocaleDayNames`, `getLocaleDayPeriods`, `getLocaleDirection`, `getLocaleEraNames`, `getLocaleExtraDayPeriodRules`, `getLocaleExtraDayPeriods`, `getLocaleFirstDayOfWeek`, `getLocaleId`, `getLocaleMonthNames`, `getLocaleNumberFormat`, `getLocaleNumberSymbol`, `getLocalePluralCase`, `getLocaleTimeFormat`, `getLocaleWeekEndRange`, `getNumberOfCurrencyDigits`\n\n##### core\n\n-   `@Component.interpolation` is deprecated. Use Angular's\n    delimiters instead.\n\n##### http\n\n-   `HttpClientModule`, `HttpClientXsrfModule` and `HttpClientJsonpModule`\n\n    As mentionned, those modules can be replaced by provider function only.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [bcce85af72](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/bcce85af72a82634f60b31d66a5ef42ecd844ce8) | refactor | remove deprecated `matchesElement` from `AnimationDriver` ([#&#8203;55479](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55479)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [d34c033902](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d34c033902b4e7543796de6c57d0cfd09093eb43) | refactor | Deprecate Local Data API functions ([#&#8203;54483](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54483)) |\n| [3b0de30b37](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3b0de30b37f558d4815ca9a61db1010aaf3df068) | refactor | remove deprecated `isPlatformWorkerApp` and `isPlatformWorkerUi` API ([#&#8203;55302](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55302)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [91b007e58f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/91b007e58ffb91f7c396cbc0333a91d18f02bd27) | fix | add math elements to schema ([#&#8203;55631](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55631)) |\n| [33d0102304](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/33d0102304e2213ee0af0bc86028a4f564c81ed4) | fix | allow comments between connected blocks ([#&#8203;55966](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55966)) |\n| [7fc7f3f05f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7fc7f3f05f0139dd773032fd5ad308f8d2a9fcf5) | fix | capture all control flow branches for content projection in if blocks ([#&#8203;54921](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54921)) |\n| [a369f43fbd](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a369f43fbdf45456bbae1caf71ef7becd15d1e90) | fix | capture switch block cases for content projection ([#&#8203;54921](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54921)) |\n| [eb625d3783](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/eb625d37839c3b9f20a2ffb3af06426f9910c8ac) | fix | declare for loop aliases in addition to new name ([#&#8203;54942](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54942)) |\n| [f824911510](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f8249115102204dbb957a0d292ed5342ea5108e9) | fix | For `FatalDiagnosticError`, hide the `message` field without affecting the emit ([#&#8203;55160](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55160)) |\n| [a040fb720a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a040fb720af7db08b328a9f78511c9881f50482d) | fix | maintain multiline CSS selectors during CSS scoping ([#&#8203;55509](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55509)) |\n| [39624c6b12](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/39624c6b129252af352c22c6d6f12ef153477bfc) | fix | output input flags as a literal ([#&#8203;55215](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/55215)) |\n| [eba92cfa55](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/eba92cfa55500f3558c02edd0aa348ae118794e0) | fix | prevent usage of reserved control flow symbol in custom interpolation context.

regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n## Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nOn three different applications Angular are failing all test that use @angular-devkit/schematics. Two of the applications were passing fine on Angular 17.2.0 but failed after upgrading to 17.3.7. The third application was a new one that was created on 17.3.7 to just for testing purses.\r\n\r\nStandard jest tests, eg testing 'Hello world' are passing. But anything using schematics is throwing with the error The encoded data was not valid for encoding utf-8.\r\n\r\n## Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate a new Angular application on 17.3.7 (latest version). Change to using Jest. Create a unit test that uses any schematics, and it throws with an encoding utf-8 error.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nExpect test to be able to run against anything with schematics, not to straight away fail. \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nTest file example:\r\n\r\n```import { TextEncoder, TextDecoder } from 'util'\r\nglobal.TextEncoder = TextEncoder\r\n//

App Hosting builder can determine the Node.js version to install. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- set Node.js version to v22.2.0\r\n- `ng new` on `@angular/cli@latest` (v17.3.7)\r\n- `ng build`\r\n- print `Building...` and never finished.\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.7\r\nNode: 22.2.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: pnpm 8.15.6\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.7\r\n@angular/ssr                    17.3.7\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.7\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.4.5\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\r\n    \r\nWarning: The current version of Node (22.2.0) is not supported by Angular.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27674","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Node.js v22.2 causes ng build hangs up\" (#27674)"},{"Id":"2309052939","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-21T20:28:54","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27672","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.3 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27672","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.0-rc.3 release\" (#27672)"},{"Id":"2309023651","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-21T20:20:44","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27671","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27671","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.0-rc.3\" with changelog.\" (#27671)"},{"Id":"2307954998","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-21T17:59:32","Actor":"medikoo","Number":"27668","RawContent":null,"Title":"Multiple steps needed to retrieve CLI version","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nversion\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI've just installed `@angular/cli` and wanted to check the installed version.

Time's precious, nobody should do needless waits if there's a faster way to do things.\r\n\r\nCan this be the beginning of a wider discussion about this, or can I be pointed to one if it's already happening?\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA build time worthy of my M1 chip and current times\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThere aren't any :(","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27666","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"A focus on faster build times\" (#27666)"},{"Id":"2306477281","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-21T04:46:29","Actor":"jeffschulzusc","Number":"27663","RawContent":null,"Title":"can not disable [suspicious-nullish-coalescing] for esbuild ","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nwebpack build\n\n### Description\n\nconverted to esbuild, getting warnings:\r\nThe \"??\" operator here will always return the left operand [suspicious-nullish-coalescing]\r\n\r\ni tried to temporarily get rid of the warnings:\r\n/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-asserted-nullish-coalescing */\r\n\r\nbut does not work ...\r\nso what rule is 'suspicious-nullish-coalescing' ? and can i disable it ?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n\"executor\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\",\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n[WARNING] The \"??\" operator here will always return the left operand [suspicious-nullish-coalescing]\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.1.4\r\nNode: 21.5.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.21\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                          Version\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect        0.1701.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular    17.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core             17.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics       17.1.4\r\n@angular/cdk                     16.2.3\r\n@angular/cdk-experimental        16.2.13\r\n@angular/cli                     17.1.4\r\n@angular/material                16.2.3\r\n@angular/material-experimental   16.2.13\r\n@schematics/angular              17.1.4\r\nrxjs                             7.8.1\r\ntypescript                       5.3.3\r\nwebpack                          5.89.0\r\nzone.js                          0.14.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27663","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"can not disable [suspicious-nullish-coalescing] for esbuild \" (#27663)"},{"Id":"2305366127","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T21:09:34","Actor":"damyanpetev","Number":"27660","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng update to 18 RC suggest wrong command to update CLI packages","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nupdate\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen updating a current project to Angular 18 RC the `ng update` command suggest to update `@angular/build` which is new and not present in the project and consecutively fails if attempted.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/3198469/e776f73c-84bc-4ab7-8ff0-520eedadcd7f)\r\n\r\nThe working command to run is still `ng update @angular/cli --next` instead, but the suggestion is wrong due to the new group name since `@angular/build` has been added as first it now shows up as the group name:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c79a513a766383a5eac44acfbb8ac3aab10bbfc4/packages/angular/cli/package.json#L45-L47\r\n\r\nNot sure what the end goal of the new package is, but assuming the CLI is not going away -

In particular I have noticed this causes legibility issues for the floating placeholder on form fields and the label text on default-appearance buttons, but it might apply to other components as well.\r\n\r\nMy theme is configured as follows:\r\n\r\n`$my-palette: mat.define-palette($greens, 600, 200, 900, 700);`\r\nNote that the $text hue is overridden to `700` in the call to `define-palette`.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot showing the 700 hue being correctly applied to the aforementioned text elements under the legacy components:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/4996462/2739e6f4-784d-41a3-81b6-4f4ee4741aa7)\r\n\r\nAnd here is how the new MDC components look:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/4996462/a57571a7-f795-4c5a-8ba5-ba4d551d5b22)\r\n\r\nI had a hard time reading the Angular Material => MDC SCSS theming code but it seems like the $text hue preference isn't being passed to the MDC mixins in any way.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-9ugktp?file=src%2Fstyles.scss\r\n2. Note that text hue is set to 900 but text button and form field label use 500\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMDC components should use specified text hue where applicable\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nMDC components used primary hue regardless\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\nEnvironment\r\nAngular: 15.0.0-17.3.9\r\nCDK/Material: 15.0.0-17.3.9\r\nBrowser(s): Chrome\r\nOperating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29076","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(style): Custom palette's text hue not propagated to MDC styles\" (#29076)"},{"Id":"2305749977","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T11:16:51","Actor":"armellarcier","Number":"29074","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): Unexpected Behavior with Number Input and MatTooltip Scrolling","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIn Angular Material, when a with matInput is used, the expected behavior is that scrolling over this input field scrolls the page. However, if I hover over any element with MatTooltip, then focus back on the number input field, the scrolling behavior unexpectedly changes. Instead of scrolling the page, it increments or decrements the number in the input. This issue can also occur on the Angular Material official [website](https://v11.material.angular.io/components/tooltip/overview).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/1194274/eb1a9a3c-70d4-40f2-a029-9986384023a7)\r\n\r\nThis is not the expected behavior : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/angular/porobbapdry?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftooltip-delay-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a page with a with matInput.\r\n2. Hover over an element with MatTooltip.\r\n3. Focus on the number input field.\r\n4. Try scrolling over the number input field.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected and consistent user experience is that scrolling over a number input field should scroll the page, not change the input's value. This unexpected behavior disrupts the user experience, especially in forms with tooltips and number inputs.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen a field with matInput is focused, and the user scrolls with the mouse wheel, the default behavior is for the page itself to scroll, not the number in the input field. However, this behavior changes after interacting with an element that has MatTooltip. Specifically, after hovering over a MatTooltip element and then focusing on the number input field, scrolling with the mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page. Instead, it changes the value in the number input field, incrementing or decrementing it. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior and occurs even on the Angular Material official website.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16\r\n- CDK/Material: 16\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System Windows + macOS + ArchLinux\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29074","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Unexpected Behavior with Number Input and MatTooltip Scrolling\" (#29074)"},{"Id":"2304021866","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T06:16:31","Actor":"maruthumj","Number":"29069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug #29047 - Glitchy password form field ","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #29047 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bug #29047 - Glitchy password form field \" (#29069)"},{"Id":"2304642935","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T06:14:00","Actor":"dreamstar-enterprises","Number":"29070","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat Select - for label not matching with id - do we have to add an extra attribute?","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI think this was actually fixed: https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28948\r\n\r\nI didn't quite understand from the above what we were meant to do.\r\n\r\nBut are we meant to include an extra attribute somewhere here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <!-- label -->\r\n    <mat-label>\r\n      {{entry.key | getAllowanceKey: false}} Allowance Basis\r\n    </mat-label>\r\n  \r\n    <!-- select -->\r\n    <mat-select\r\n      id=\"allowanceBasis-hardware-{{$index}}\"\r\n      formControlName=\"allowanceBasis\"\r\n      required>\r\n      <mat-option>-- None --</mat-option>\r\n      @for (allowanceBasisType of\r\n        AllowanceBasisTypes | sortAlphabetical;\r\n        track allowanceBasisType) {\r\n        <mat-option [value]=\"allowanceBasisType\">{{allowanceBasisType | replaceUnderscores | titleCase}}</mat-option>\r\n      }\r\n    </mat-select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nto prevent this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"582\" alt=\"243509402-88ceec48-3c7d-4c7a-a62c-4b9d3694c3f2\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/39380005/b8dbe13a-3791-4c5f-a9b5-0e8219c19fd4\">\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nPlease see above\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nSee above\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29070","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Mat Select - for label not matching with id - do we have to add an extra attribute?\" (#29070)"},{"Id":"2305117022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-20T05:26:00","Actor":"shhdharmen","Number":"29072","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(CdkMenu/CdkContextMenuTriggerFor): Allow CdkMenu to be programmatically opened/closed","State":"open","Body":"## Feature Description\r\n\r\n### Current Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe directive `CdkMenu` is used with combination of `CdkContextMenuTriggerFor`.

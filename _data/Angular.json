In this case HTTP code is 200 and body contains non json content such as `<html>...</html>`. JSON.parse fails parsing the response and hits the `catchError` operator.\r\n\r\nThe error in HttpErrorResponse sounds like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n HttpErrorResponse {headers: HttpHeaders, status: 200, ...}\r\n         error:\r\n           error: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input at ..\r\n....\r\n         ok: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n# How I want to test it\r\n\r\nNow, I want to test this case by flushing html response (instead of JSON). So, my expectation would look like this:\r\n\r\n* I expect json to be returned from the tested endpoint (`responseType: json`)\r\n* I flush html content with `Content-type: text/html`\r\n\r\n```\r\n    it('maps it to 200 although it fails parsing JSON response', done => {\r\n      httpClient.get<Data>(testUrl, { responseType: 'json' }).subscribe(res => {\r\n        expect(res).toEqual({});\r\n        done();\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      const req = httpMock.expectOne(testUrl);\r\n      const headers = new HttpHeaders();\r\n      headers.append('content-type', 'text/html');\r\n\r\n      req.flush('<html></html>', { headers, statusText: 'OK', status: 200 });\r\n\r\n      httpMock.verify();\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and the according implementation could look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class MyInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\r\n  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {\r\n    return next.handle(req).pipe(\r\n      catchError(err => {\r\n       // Note: ok is set to false in XHR implementation when parsing fails\r\n        if (err.status === 200 && err.ok === false) {\r\n          return of(new HttpResponse({ body: {}, status: err.status, headers: err.headers, statusText: err.statusText }));\r\n        }\r\n        return throwError(err);\r\n      }),\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# What is the actual issue\r\n\r\nHowever, testing infrastructure does not properly handle the content type (as real XHR implementation does). Thus, it does not reach `catchError` block. This is because `_toJsonBody` does not try to parse the response. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/025903566edaf3615d12a348dcf7813b298ed4f1/packages/common/http/testing/src/request.ts#L163\r\n```\r\n    function _toJsonBody(body, format) {\r\n        if (format === void 0) { format = 'JSON'; }\r\n        if (typeof ArrayBuffer !== 'undefined' && body instanceof ArrayBuffer) {\r\n            throw new Error(\"Automatic conversion to \" + format + \" is not supported for ArrayBuffers.\");\r\n        }\r\n        if (typeof Blob !== 'undefined' && body instanceof Blob) {\r\n            throw new Error(\"Automatic conversion to \" + format + \" is not supported for Blobs.\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n// -------------------- NO JSON.parse here -----------------------------\r\n        if (typeof body === 'string' || typeof body === 'number' || typeof body === 'object' ||\r\n            typeof body === 'boolean' || Array.isArray(body)) {\r\n            return body;\r\n        }\r\n        throw new Error(\"Automatic conversion to \" + format + \" is not supported for response type.\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, the test fails as it never reaches `catchError`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality\r\n\r\nExpected: {}\r\nReceived: \"<html></html>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an alternative solution, I tried to flush `HttpErrorResponse` using `.error` method, however this does not accept status = 200:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/025903566edaf3615d12a348dcf7813b298ed4f1/packages/common/http/testing/src/request.ts#L98\r\n```\r\n            if (opts.status && opts.status >= 200 && opts.status < 300) {\r\n                throw new Error(\"error() called with a successful status.\");\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\n# What could the solution look like\r\n\r\nA possible solution could be (quickly scripted within the bundle):\r\n\r\n## _toJsonBody:\r\n```\r\n    function _toJsonBody(body, format) {\r\n        if (format === void 0) { format = 'JSON'; }\r\n        if (typeof ArrayBuffer !== 'undefined' && body instanceof ArrayBuffer) {\r\n            throw new Error(\"Automatic conversion to \" + format + \" is not supported for ArrayBuffers.\");\r\n        }\r\n        if (typeof Blob !== 'undefined' && body instanceof Blob) {\r\n            throw new Error(\"Automatic conversion to \" + format + \" is not supported for Blobs.\");\r\n        }\r\n//-------------------------\r\n// try to parse it as it is expected to be JSON\r\n//-------------------------\r\n        if (format === 'JSON' && (typeof body === 'string' || typeof body === 'number' || typeof body === 'object' ||\r\n            typeof body === 'boolean' || Array.isArray(body))) {\r\n            return JSON.parse(body);\r\n        }\r\n        throw new Error(\"Automatic conversion to \" + format + \" is not supported for response type.\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## flush\r\n```\r\n        TestRequest.prototype.flush = function (body, opts) {\r\n            if (opts === void 0) { opts = {}; }\r\n            if (this.cancelled) {\r\n                throw new Error(\"Cannot flush a cancelled request.\");\r\n            }\r\n            var url = this.request.urlWithParams;\r\n            var headers = (opts.headers instanceof http.HttpHeaders) ?

After upgrading to angular 13 this is no longer compatible with the live re-loader because its url has been changed from `/socket-nodejs/xxx/xxx/websocket` to `/ws/` which conflicts with the http proxy in my case. \r\n\r\nThis results in the client continuously attempting to establish a connection with `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END` displayed in the dev server console.\r\n\r\nI followed the upgrade guide for a complex app, but didn't see anything relevant to this change: https://update.angular.io/?l=3&v=12.0-13.0\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Start a server on `localhost:8000` that establishes a websocket connections on `/ws/` (the actual establishment might not be a necessary step)\r\n2. Route all `/ws/` requests to that server in your `proxy.config.json`:  \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"/ws\": {\r\n    \"target\": \"http://localhost:8000\",\r\n    \"secure\": false,\r\n    \"ws\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. run `ng serve`  \r\n4. Check either the dev server console to see the exception above, or watch the network tab in the browser to see the attempts to establish a connection over and over\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<e> [webpack-dev-server] [HPM] WebSocket error: Error [ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END]: write after end\r\n<e>     at new NodeError (node:internal/errors:371:5)\r\n<e>     at _write (node:internal/streams/writable:319:11)\r\n<e>     at Socket.Writable.write (node:internal/streams/writable:334:10)\r\n<e>     at Sender.sendFrame (/home/brian/dev/preondock/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/node_modules/ws/lib/sender.js:469:20)\r\n<e>     at Sender.close (/home/brian/dev/preondock/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/node_modules/ws/lib/sender.js:197:12)\r\n<e>     at WebSocket.close (/home/brian/dev/preondock/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/node_modules/ws/lib/websocket.js:300:18)\r\n<e>     at Receiver.receiverOnConclude (/home/brian/dev/preondock/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/node_modules/ws/lib/websocket.js:1114:18)\r\n<e>     at Receiver.emit (node:events:526:28)\r\n<e>     at Receiver.controlMessage (/home/brian/dev/preondock/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:582:14)\r\n<e>     at Receiver.getData (/home/brian/dev/preondock/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:429:42) {\r\n<e>   code: 'ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END'\r\n<e> }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.7\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.5\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.7\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.7\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.7\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.6.4\r\n    \r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the live reload path was made configurable ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23260","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"After upgrading from 12 to 13, the live reload websocket URL path `/ws/` conflicts with the application when using the same path\" (#23260)"},{"Id":"1258275057","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-02T19:53:58","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23268","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(@angular/cli): force using `NPM_CONFIG_legacy_peer_deps` for  `ng add` NPM 7 test","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n`NPM_CONFIG_legacy_peer_deps` is set to `true` during snapshot test runs https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/177fa0d8c0076589fc12bce5ca5969606d541336/tests/legacy-cli/e2e/utils/packages.ts#L67-L69.

programatically as a promise\n\n> I am looking for a better name, feel free to drop your ideas.\n\nOn v6 [https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/pull/2165](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/pull/2165) this was improved and I am moving the same API to v5 so is much easier to migrate in the future.\n\n> It's a bit experimental, it does not replace the old way, so won't break anything, but allows smooth migration\n\nThere are three ways to use it:\n\n-   No input, it will find the `config.yaml` as is you would run `  verdaccio ` in the console\n-   With a absolute path\n-   With an object (there is a catch here, see below)\n\n<!---->\n\n        const {runServer} = require('verdaccio');\n        const app = await runServer(); // default configuration\n        const app = await runServer('./config/config.yaml');\n        const app = await runServer({ configuration });\n        app.listen(4000, (event) => {\n          // do something\n        });\n\nWith an object you need to add `self_path`, manually (it's not nice but would be a breaking change changing it now) on v6 this is not longer need it.\n\n          const configPath = join(__dirname, './config.yaml');\n          const c = parseConfigFile(configPath);\n          // workaround\n          // on v5 the `self_path` still exists and will be removed in v6\n          c.self_path = 'foo';\n          runServer(c).then(() => {});\n\nRead more here

Add a `package.json` to the directory and set `\"sideEffects\": [\"./index.ts\", \"./abstract-control.ts\" and \"./abstract-control.directive.ts\"]` in it\r\n    3. Add a `package.json` to the directory and set `\"sideEffects\": true` in it\r\n* specifying a rule in Webpack's `module.rules` that matches every TS file in the directory and set `sideEffects: true`\r\n\r\nDespite that, they are all excluded from the bundle. Could this be an issue with [Angular's webpack config](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/13.2.x/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/configs/common.ts) or [`@angular-builders/custom-webpack`](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack)?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nReproduction repository: https://github.com/amitbeck/ng-webpack-sideEffects-repro\r\nEither:\r\n1.

Essentially launching each test in a subprocess to a) not mix with the test-runner PATH, npm modules etc, b) prevent environment (vars, cwd, ...) side effects from one test effecting the next tests or the test-runner.\r\n\r\nPrefactor commits (can be merged on their own ahead of time instead of squashing):\r\n* ~~Wait for `killAllProcesses` to actually complete before proceeding. Killing a procedure is async but was not being await-ed. This creates race conditions but once tests are run in a subprocess those are far more likely (the subprocess dies before killing subprocesses completes).~~ EDIT: was done in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/f70557afc11bccf549dd37d82484104865fa3fb4\r\n* Refactor the main e2e_runner.ts into separate methods, async/await instead of `.then`.\r\n* Distinguish test setup vs tests better (in preparation for tests being launched in subprocesses, also distinguishes setup vs test better in the stdout).\r\n\r\nMain change:\r\n* A specific version of npm + yarn are installed alongside the angular-cli npm package being tested. This will be required in bazel where nothing outside the sandbox (global node/npm/yarn) is accessible. This also sets specific version numbers which could be dynamic in the future.\r\n* Tests run in a sandboxed subprocess environment using those specific npm + yarn + cli packages.\r\n* Tests no longer have access to the node_modules or environment of the test-runner, only the modules installed within that sandboxed environment. So things like `puppeteer` now need to be installed within the sandboxed test environment (previously it was using the one in the git repo node_modules). The `protractor` used in the tests is now the correct one in the test project node_modules (not the one the cli git repo node_modules), so `webdriver-manager` must now run on that test project and not only the git repo.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n* launch \"setup\" in the main process to setup the test environment (no real changes from before)\r\n* launch each \"initializer\" in subprocesses (some of the previous \"setup\" scripts are now \"initializers\" which run in the subprocess, but no big changes)\r\n* launch each test in the

updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/angular</summary>\n\n### [`v14.0.0`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-2022-06-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-rc.3...14.0.0)\n\n[Blog post \"Angular v14 is now available\"](http://goo.gle/angular-v14).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### animations\n\n-   The `AnimationDriver.getParentElement` method has become required, so any\n    implementors of this interface are now required to provide an implementation\n    for this method. This breakage is unlikely to affect application developers,\n    as `AnimationDriver` is not expected to be implemented in user code.\n\n##### common\n\n-   Adds new required class member that any implementors of the LocationStrategy will need to satisfy.\n    Location does not depend on PlatformLocation anymore.\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   Keyframes names are now prefixed with the component's \"scope name\".\n    For example, the following keyframes rule in a component definition,\n    whose \"scope name\" is host-my-cmp:\n\n    [@&#8203;keyframes](https://togithub.com/keyframes) foo { ... }\n\n    will become:\n\n    [@&#8203;keyframes](https://togithub.com/keyframes) host-my-cmp_foo { ... }\n\n    Any TypeScript/JavaScript code which relied on the names of keyframes rules\n    will no longer match.\n\n    The recommended solutions in this case are to either:\n\n    -   change the component's view encapsulation to the `None` or `ShadowDom`\n    -   define keyframes rules in global stylesheets (e.g styles.css)\n    -   define keyframes rules programmatically in code.\n-   Keyframes names are now prefixed with the component's \"scope name\".\n    For example, the following keyframes rule in a component definition,\n    whose \"scope name\" is host-my-cmp:\n\n    [@&#8203;keyframes](https://togithub.com/keyframes) foo { ... }\n\n    will become:\n\n    [@&#8203;keyframes](https://togithub.com/keyframes) host-my-cmp_foo { ... }\n\n    Any TypeScript/JavaScript code which relied on the names of keyframes rules\n    will no longer match.\n\n    The recommended solutions in this case are to either:\n\n    -   change the component's view encapsulation to the `None` or `ShadowDom`\n    -   define keyframes rules in global stylesheets (e.g styles.css)\n    -   define keyframes rules programmatically in code.\n\n##### core\n\n-   Support for Node.js v12 has been removed as it will become EOL on 2022-04-30. Please use Node.js v14.15 or later.\n-   TypeScript versions older than 4.6 are no longer supported.\n-   Forms \\[email] input coercion\n\n    Forms \\[email] input value will be considered as true if it is defined with any value rather\n    than false and 'false'.\n-   Since Ivy, TestBed doesn't use AOT summaries. The `aotSummaries` fields in TestBed APIs were present, but unused. The fields were deprecated in previous major version and in v14 those fields are removed. The `aotSummaries` fields were completely unused, so you can just drop them from the TestBed APIs usage.\n\n##### forms\n\n-   Forms classes accept a generic.\n\n    Forms model classes now accept a generic type parameter. Untyped versions of these classes are available to opt-out of the new, stricter behavior.\n-   objects with a length key set to zero will no longer validate as empty.\n\n    This is technically a breaking change, since objects with a key `length` and value `0` will no longer validate as empty. This is a very minor change, and any reliance on this behavior is probably a bug anyway.\n\n##### http\n\n-   Queries including + will now actually query for + instead of space.\n    Most workarounds involving custom codecs will be unaffected.\n    Possible server-side workarounds will need to be undone.\n-   JSONP will throw an error when headers are set on a reques\n\n    JSONP does not support headers being set on requests. Before when\n    a request was sent to a JSONP backend that had headers set the headers\n    were ignored. The JSONP backend will now throw an error if it\n    receives a request that has any headers set. Any uses of JSONP\n    on requests with headers set will need to remove the headers\n    to avoid the error.\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   This change may cause a breaking change in unit tests that are implicitly depending on a specific\n    number and sequence of change detections in order for their assertions to pass.\n-   This may break invalid calls to `TransferState` methods.\n\n    This tightens parameter types of `TransferState` usage, and is a minor breaking change which may reveal existing problematic calls.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The type of `Route.pathMatch` is now more strict. Places that use\n    `pathMatch` will likely need to be updated to have an explicit\n    `Route`/`Routes` type so that TypeScript does not infer the type as\n    `string`.\n-   When returning a `Promise` from the\n    `LoadChildrenCallback`, the possible type is now restricted to\n    `Type<any>|NgModuleFactory<any>` rather than `any`.\n-   `initialNavigation: 'enabled'` was deprecated in v11 and is replaced by\n    `initialNavigation: 'enabledBlocking'`.\n-   The type of `component` on `ActivatedRoute` and `ActivatedRouteSnapshot`\n    includes `string`. In reality, this is not the case. The component\n    cannot be anything other than a component class.\n-   -   The type of `initialUrl` is set to `string|UrlTree` but in reality,\n        the `Router` only sets it to a value that will always be `UrlTree`\n    -   `initialUrl` is documented as \"The target URL passed into the\n        `Router#navigateByUrl()` call before navigation\" but the value\n        actually gets set to something completely different. It's set to the\n        current internal `UrlTree` of the Router at the time navigation\n        occurs.\n    With this change, there is no exact replacement for the old value of\n    `initialUrl` because it was enver intended to be exposed.\n    `Router.url` is likely the best replacement for this.\n    In more specific use-cases, tracking the `finalUrl` between successful\n    navigations can also be used as a replacement.\n-   Lazy loaded configs are now also validated once loaded like the\n    initial set of routes are. Lazy loaded modules which have invalid Route\n    configs will now error. Note that this is only done in dev mode so\n    there is no production impact of this change.\n-   When a guard returns a `UrlTree`, the router would previously schedule\n    the redirect navigation within a `setTimeout`. This timeout is now removed,\n    which can result in test failures due to incorrectly written tests.\n    Tests which perform navigations should ensure that all timeouts are\n    flushed before making assertions. Tests should ensure they are capable\n    of handling all redirects from the original navigation.\n-   Previously, resolvers were waiting to be completed\n    before proceeding with the navigation and the Router would take the last\n    value emitted from the resolver.\n    The router now takes only the first emitted value by the resolvers\n    and then proceeds with navigation. This is now consistent with `Observables`\n    returned by other guards: only the first value is used.\n\n##### zone.js\n\n-   in TaskTrackingZoneSpec track a periodic task until it is cancelled\n\n    The breaking change is scoped only to the plugin\n    `zone.js/plugins/task-tracking`. If you used `TaskTrackingZoneSpec` and\n    checked the pending macroTasks e.g. using `(this.ngZone as any)._inner\n    ._parent._properties.TaskTrackingZone.getTasksFor('macroTask')`, then\n    its behavior slightly changed for periodic macrotasks. For example,\n    previously the `setInterval` macrotask was no longer tracked after its\n    callback was executed for the first time. Now it's tracked until\n    the task is explicitly cancelled, e.g  with `clearInterval(id)`.\n\n    fixes 45350\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### common\n\n-   The `ngModuleFactory` input of the `NgComponentOutlet` directive is deprecated in favor of a newly added `ngModule` input. The `ngModule` input accepts references to the NgModule class directly, without the need to resolve module factory first.\n\n##### forms\n\n-   The `initialValueIsDefault` option has been deprecated and replaced with the otherwise-identical `nonNullable` option, for the sake of naming consistency.\n-   It is now deprecated to provide *both* `AbstractControlOption`s and an async validators argument to a FormControl. Previously, the async validators would just be silently dropped, resulting in a probably buggy forms. Now, the constructor call is deprecated, and Angular will print a warning in devmode.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `resolver` argument of the `RouterOutletContract.activateWith` function and the `resolver` field of the `OutletContext` class are deprecated. Passing component factory resolvers are no longer needed. The `ComponentFactoryResolver`-related symbols were deprecated in `@angular/core` package since v13.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

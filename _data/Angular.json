Note that the attacker has to know the port and the output entrypoint script path. Combined with prototype pollution, the attacker can get a reference to the webpack runtime variables.\nBy using Function::toString against the values in __webpack_modules__, the attacker can get the source code.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1.

In my application, I have implemented a dialog component along with both dragging and resizing functionality. While I have successfully enabled dragging within the screen (viewport) and resizing functionality, I am facing an issue when the dialog is dragged to the top-left corner. In this scenario, resizing the dialog causes it to move outside the viewport, which is not the expected behavior.\nExpected Behavior:\nWhen the dialog is dragged to the top-left corner, resizing should not cause it to move outside the visible area of the screen. Instead, it should resize towards the bottom and right directions while remaining fully within the viewport.\n\nThis is the Angular 8 referance\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/58606128/draggable-and-resizeable-mat-dialog-in-angular-8\n\nHere is angular 16\nhttps://angular-lhvwndmb.stackblitz.io\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://angular-lhvwndmb.stackblitz.io\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-jszctmpc?file=package.json (angular 8)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the dialog.\n2. Resize the dialog to its minimum height and width.\n3. Drag the dialog to the top-left corner of the screen.\n4. Attempt to resize the dialog to its maximum height and width.\n5. Notice that the dialog moves out of the visible area. Since dragging is only enabled via the header/title bar, and that portion goes off-screen, it becomes impossible to drag the dialog back down.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected Behavior:\nWhen the dialog is dragged to the top-left corner, resizing should not cause it to move outside the visible area of the screen. Instead, it should resize towards the bottom and right directions while remaining fully within the viewport.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nActual Behavior:\nWhen the dialog is dragged to the top-left corner, resizing dialog move outside the visible area of the screen.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.2.6\n- CDK/Material:16.2.5\n- Browser(s): chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macos, windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31326","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(DIALOG): draggable and resizeable mat-dialog in Angular 16\" (#31326)"},{"Id":"3134743856","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-10T22:03:38","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"31325","RawContent":null,"Title":"[18.2.x] ci: update to latest version of dev-infra actions","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31325","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[18.2.x] ci: update to latest version of dev-infra actions\" (#31325)"},{"Id":"3127258509","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-10T16:56:34","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"31311","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): ensure disabled slider thumb input has 'auto' c…","State":"closed","Body":"…ursor\r\n\r\nFixes #31306","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31311","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/slider): ensure disabled slider thumb input has 'auto' c…\" (#31311)"},{"Id":"3134243199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-10T16:42:21","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31322","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: create an m2 system directory","State":"open","Body":"No-op change that moves M2 system values to mimic M3 system values, with its own directory separated into categories","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31322","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: create an m2 system directory\" (#31322)"},{"Id":"3129378934","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-10T12:52:07","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31317","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(multiple): remove invalid tags from doc strings","State":"closed","Body":"We had `@link` doc strings in several doc strings, but we don't have any handling for `@link` in the pipeline which was causing it to log some warnings.

To speed things up I build the Angular front-end GUI directly in the local installed Chrome browser (Version 87.0.4280.141, 64-bit) by running `ng s` and then opening the Ng server at `http://localhost:4200` - everything is working as it should, and I rarely had to manually call ChangeDetection to propagate new comp changes to the template.\r\n\r\nWhen I now open the same Ng project in Electron 12.x which runs Chromium 89.0.4389.69, a lot of the JS functionality does not work anymore and it turns out that changeDetection is needed in many places to propagate the changes from the component to the template...\r\n\r\nFurthermore, my Karma/Jasmine unit tests which include shallow integration tests (that interact w/ the GUI) all work flawlessly (no errors reported and interaction w/ html elements works), yet since the Ng build now does not work as expected in Electron's Chromium, I guess this renders some of these shallow integration tests completely useless as some of these html elements do not exist in Ng running in Electron (unless I add CD everywhere)... yet Karma/Jasmine reports no errors...

Webpack 4 usage and support has been removed.\r\nNo project level configuration changes are required to take advantage of the upgraded Webpack version when using the official Angular builders.\r\nCustom builders based on this package that use the experimental programmatic APIs may need to be updated to become compatible with Webpack 5.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Webpack 5 lazy loaded file name changes\r\nWebpack 5 generates similar but differently named files for lazy loaded JavaScript files in development configurations (when the `namedChunks` option is enabled).\r\nFor the majority of users this change should have no effect on the application and/or build process. Production builds should also not be affected as the `namedChunks` option is disabled by default in production configurations.\r\nHowever, if a project's post-build process makes assumptions as to the file names then adjustments may need to be made to account for the new naming paradigm.\r\nSuch post-build processes could include custom file transformations after the build, integration into service-side frameworks, or deployment procedures.\r\nExample development file name change: `lazy-lazy-module.js` --> `src_app_lazy_lazy_module_ts.js`\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Webpack 5 web worker support\r\nWebpack 5 now includes web worker support. However, the structure of the URL within the `Worker` constructor must be in a specific format that differs from the current requirement.\r\nWeb worker usage should be updated as shown below (where `./app.worker` should be replaced with the actual worker name):\r\nBefore: `new Worker('./app.worker', ...)`\r\nAfter:  `new Worker(new URL('./app.worker', import.meta.url), ...)`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20466","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Upgrade tooling to use Webpack 5\" (#20466)"},{"Id":"853447055","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-08T12:58:54","Actor":"andreyan-andreev","Number":"20476","RawContent":null,"Title":"tsconfig IDE support for multi project workspace","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 Feature request\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [X] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nsee above. \r\n\r\nThe problem I encountered is that I was not able to use `paths` configuration in tsconfig, the compiler works but the ide cries. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd `tsconfig.json` file at the application directory\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": \"./tsconfig.app.json\",\r\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"] I have to add because new files were not picked up by tsserver, something about \"the file is not part of tsconfig project\" etc.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20476","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"tsconfig IDE support for multi project workspace\" (#20476)"},{"Id":"853157783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-08T12:35:26","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"20468","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update typescript to version 4.2.4","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)) | [`4.2.3` -> `4.2.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/4.2.3/4.2.4) | [![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/typescript/4.2.4/age-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/typescript/4.2.4/adoption-slim)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/typescript/4.2.4/compatibility-slim/4.2.3)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/typescript/4.2.4/confidence-slim/4.2.3)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

  `[hash]` and `[fullhash]` works as in webpack (i.e. it is `hash` of build, not content hash of file), to migrate change `[name].[hash].[ext]` to `[name].[contenthash][ext]`\n    -   `[ext]` doesn't require `.` (dot) before, i.e. change `[name].[ext]` to `[name][ext]`\n    -   `[<hashType>:contenthash:<digestType>:<length>]` and `[<hashType>:hash:<digestType>:<length>]` is not supported anymore, you can use `output.hashDigest`, `output.hashDigestLength` and `output.hashFunction` options to setup it\n    -

Updates the property view to identify Wiz component internal properties as \"State\", aligning with that framework's convention.\r\n5. Updates the component tree to use the component name provided by `ng.getDirectiveMetadata`.\r\n    * Wiz components often do not have meaningful tag names, so we want to use the component name provided by the framework.\r\n\r\nAngular's implementation of `ng.getDirectiveMetadata` is unchanged.

This is only for custom setups.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWith the recent changes to the APF bundling rules, we turned on tree-shaking in rollup to support proper code splitting for FESM bundles.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in Rollup re-ordering imports in the FESM bundles of `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic`â€” highlighting that over the past years, this package \"accidentally\" resulted in the side-effects of the compiler registering itself globally.\r\n\r\nThis continues to be the case, and our changes generally didn't cause any issues in CLI applications because the CLI explicitly wires up the compiler (as expected) before `-dynamic` is even loaded. For custom setup, like Analog, this order change surfaced a breakage because e.g. `@angular/common` with its JIT decorators of e.g. directives/services are triggered before the compiler is actually loaded/made available.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this. The explicit imports in practice are a noop because our FESM bundling doesn't recognize compiler as side-effects true; but marking the whole -dynamic package as having side-effects; prevents rollup from swapping the import order. Long-term, we should look into improving this by teaching `ng_package` that e.g. the compiler has side-effects; so that the `import @angular/compiler` statement is not dropped when constructing FESM bundles.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60458","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(platform-browser-dynamic): ensure compiler is loaded before `@angular/common`\" (#60458)"},{"Id":"2931351475","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-19T14:49:28","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"60456","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"See associated pull request for more information.\r\n\r\nCloses #60413 as a pr takeover\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60456","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: lock file maintenance\" (#60456)"},{"Id":"2932051636","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-19T14:39:49","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"60463","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): share code between ComponentRef and targeted instructâ€¦","State":"open","Body":"â€¦ions\r\n\r\nThis refactor reorganizes code such that the dynamic bindings logic and targeted listener instruction can share most of the code.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60463","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): share code between ComponentRef and targeted instructâ€¦\" (#60463)"},{"Id":"2931847870","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-19T13:43:00","Actor":"aparzi","Number":"60459","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): fix used templates are not deleted","State":"open","Body":"After running the control flow migration, used templates are not deleted.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [X] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nAfter running the control flow migration, used templates are not deleted.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #56965\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60459","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): fix used templates are not deleted\" (#60459)"},{"Id":"2931330988","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-19T10:54:59","Actor":"Ivy2012","Number":"60454","RawContent":null,"Title":"Content-projection failing when target is inside nested control-flow if-statements","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen you try to project content inside your component, and the content you try to project is nested inside several levels (at least two) of control flow if-statements, the projection is failing.\n\nWhen using the traditional ngIf directive, or a one-level control flow if-statement, everything works as expected. \n\nIt's the \"at least two levels\" with if-statements that breaks the projection.\n\nSee linked code example, that provides full clarity for both working- and non-working scenarios, more specifically line 14 and 25-36 in main.ts.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-l5kxrtha?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nContent projection (attribute-selector) does not work as intended.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nNote: also counts for Angular `19.0.0`,  see linked code that runs on that version.\nBelow is output from my local environment, problem also encountered there.\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.13\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.12\n@angular/cli                    18.2.12\n@schematics/angular             18.2.12\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI did not test whether or not this is related to the method of selection.

`something.ts` file in `src/app`: \n\n```ts\nexport const title = 'something';\n```\n\nUpdate the component to use it with a dynamic import:\n```ts\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { title } from './something';\nconsole.log(title);\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  imports: [],\n  template: '<button (click)=\"update()\">{{ title }}</button>',\n  styleUrl:

}\n}\n```\n\nSimplify the test into:\n```ts\nimport { fakeAsync, TestBed, tick } from '@angular/core/testing';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\ndescribe('AppComponent', () => {\n  beforeEach(async () => {\n    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      imports: [AppComponent],\n    }).compileComponents();\n  });\n\n  it('should update title', fakeAsync(() => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);\n    const compiled = fixture.nativeElement as HTMLElement;\n    compiled.querySelector('button')?.dispatchEvent(new Event('click'));\n    tick();\n    expect(fixture.componentInstance.title).toBe('something');\n  }));\n});\n```\n\nRun `ng test`, and the test fails, with no error.\n\nAdd the webpack builder back:\n```\nnpm i --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular@20.0.0-next.1\n```\n\nChange `angular.json` to use `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\",`, and `ng test` suceeds.\n\n### Exception or

On the latest Angular version - 19.2.3 - when switching \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\" mode from \"browser\" to \"application\", my tests lose the ability to load assets. I presume the assets are still served, but couldn't figure out what's the new path is. In the \"browser\" setup, the assets load perfectly fine from the same path as in the full application.\n\nTest builder configuration:\n```json\n\"test\": {\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"main\": \"src/test.ts\",\n            \"include\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\"],\n            \"polyfills\": \"src/polyfills.ts\",\n            \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.spec.json\",\n            \"karmaConfig\": \"karma.conf.js\",\n            \"builderMode\": \"browser\",\n            \"assets\": [\n              \"src/favicon.ico\",\n              \"src/assets\",\n              {\n                \"glob\": \"**/testing/*.png\",\n                \"input\": \"src/app/\",\n                \"output\": \"/test-images/\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"styles\": [\"src/styles.scss\"],\n            \"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\n              \"includePaths\": [\"src/styles\", \"node_modules/\"]\n            },\n            \"scripts\": []\n          }\n        },\n```\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHave a component that uses Mat Icon SVG icons.\n\nMy icon initializer:\n```\nexport const iconsAppInitializer = provideAppInitializer(() => {\n  const iconRegistry = inject(MatIconRegistry);\n  const sanitizer = inject(DomSanitizer);\n  iconRegistry.addSvgIconResolver((name, namespace: string) => {\n    // Namespaces: \"ggcc\", \"material-filled\", \"material-outlined\", \"material-symbols-outlined\"\n    return sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(`assets/images/icons/${namespace}/${name}.icon.svg`);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAuthor a test for the component.\n\nTo load icons in the test, provide these:\n```\n  iconsAppInitializer,\n  provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi()),\n```\n\nRun the test, i.e. `ng test --browsers=ChromiumHeadless --include=**/page-signin.component.spec.ts`.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nNode.js version v23.6.0 detected.\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

On my local project the compilation issue is related to `CdkFixedSizeVirtualScroll` used by CDK overlay, but testing on stack blitz it appears to be an issue with many different directives.\n\nError message from my local project:\n```\nâœ˜ [ERROR] TS-993004: Unable to import directive CdkFixedSizeVirtualScroll.\n  The symbol is not exported from ./node_modules/@angular/cdk/overlay/index.d.ts\n(module '@angular/cdk/overlay').

not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen the `MatTimepickerInput` component is within a shadow DOM, the input element's value will get formatted more often than it should, which results in unexpected behavior when typing.\n\nThe reason for this is [`MatTimepickerInput._hasFocus()`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/443df2661fa3174bd2c854d9a094c8ade1b47446/src/material/timepicker/timepicker-input.ts#L408) making the assumption that the component will never be in the shadow DOM, doing a check that `inject(DOCUMENT).activeElement === inject(ElementRef).nativeElement`.\n\n`inject(DOCUMENT)` refers to the root document, so when the `MatTimepickerInput` component instance is in the shadow DOM, the check that `MatTimepickerInput._hasFocus()` is doing will never be `true`.\n\nThe comparison that should actually be done is `inject(ElementRef).nativeElement.getRootNode().activeElement === inject(ElementRef).nativeElement`.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:

On typing \":\", \"2:\" will be in the input.\n6. On typing \"3\", \"2:03 AM\" will be in the input.\n7. On typing \"0\", nothing will be in the input.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is typing \"12:30 PM\", and the \"12:30 PM\" option being selected.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1.

Repeat step 4 as often as you like to create N overlays\n\n(no idea how to reproduce this behavior in StackBlitz/local)\n\nCode for reproduction\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [DemoMaterialModule],\n  template: `\n    <mat-form-field>\n      <mat-label>Pick a time</mat-label>\n      <input matInput [matTimepicker]=\"picker\">\n      <mat-timepicker-toggle matIconSuffix [for]=\"picker\"/>\n      <mat-timepicker #picker/>\n    </mat-form-field>\n  `,\n  styles: `\n    :host {\n      display: flex;\n      flex-direction: column;\n      justify-content: flex-end;\n      height: calc(100vh - 2rem);\n    }\n  `\n})\nexport class App {}\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- No error\n- No multiple `Timepicker` overlays\n- The already existing overlay should be closed and not reopened\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- error \"Host already has a portal attached\"\n- Multiple `Timepicker` overlays (at leat at https://material.angular.io/components/timepicker/examples)\n- The already existing overlay gets closed and reopened\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.1\n- Browser(s): Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30637","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(timepicker): Multiple overlays and host already has a portal attached\" (#30637)"},{"Id":"2925080346","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-17T16:07:03","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30639","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/timepicker): assertion error if reopened quickly","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the timepicker was throwing an error if it gets closed and reopened before change detection has had a chance to run.\r\n\r\nFixes #30637.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30639","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/timepicker): assertion error if reopened quickly\" (#30639)"},{"Id":"2924585402","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-17T13:05:59","Actor":"msgoloborodov","Number":"30636","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add backdrop to autocomplete overlay","State":"closed","Body":"mat-select has ovarlay with transparent backdrop, but mat-autocomplete hasn't.\nIt almost same components, and it should has same behavior.\n\n_getOverlayConfig method of MatAutocompleteTrigger should also return `{ hasBackdrop: true, backdropClass: 'cdk-overlay-transparent-backdrop' }`.\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/b08860440abd596a174fa3a88699c68115eb38d2/src/material/autocomplete/autocomplete-trigger.ts#L903","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30636","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add backdrop to autocomplete overlay\" (#30636)"},{"Id":"2922026892","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-15T11:41:11","Actor":"worthy7","Number":"30635","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(MatCalendar): Allow to turn focus off on change inputs to MatCalendar","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nAdd some option so that MatCalendar does not take focus when it's inputs are changed.\n\n### Use Case\n\nThank you for making a very beautiful calendar/date picker for material ðŸ™‚\n\n\nI am using the calendar and dynamically deciding which dates are selectable or not from some backend service.\n\nWhen the user changes month, it requests the available dates, and updates the myFilter observable which produces a new function, which causes MatCalendar to recheck all the shown dates to see if it should disable that date or not.\n\nThis works great, but the issue is that sometimes the data is updated by other things - not month change - that are on a different part of the screen. The available dates will update, the observable pushes a new filter function.\n\nThe problem is that this causes the MatCalendar to take focus, and scrolls my user from wherever they are on the screen, I cannot allow this but don't see a way to solve it without disabling the filter all-together.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30635","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatCalendar): Allow to turn focus off on change inputs to MatCalendar\" (#30635)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-03-20T03:30:02.5249201Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1575}

Naively, I could define `imageBlobUrl` as:\r\n```typescript\r\nimageBlobUrl = computed(() => URL.createBlobURL(imageBlob()))\r\n```\r\nHowever, this would leak the object URLs. Where should I call `URL.revokeObjectURL`?\r\n\r\n*(`URL.createBlobURL`/`URL.revokeObjectURL` could, of course, be substituted for any resource that needs explicit cleanup, like an open `WritableStream`, an open WebSocket, a handle into WASM memory, etc.)*\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n`computed` could take an additional option `cleanup` that is called some (unspecified) time after a `computed`'s value changes with the previous value:\r\n```typescript\r\nimageBlobUrl = computed(() => URL.createBlobURL(imageBlob()), {cleanup: URL.revokeObjectURL})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `computed` could adopt an API similar to `effect` for registering a cleanup callback (though for this particular example it's much more cumbersome):\r\n```typescript\r\nimageBlobUrl = computed((onCleanup) => {\r\n  const ret = URL.createBlobURL(imageBlob());\r\n  onCleanup(() => URL.revokeObjectURL(ret));\r\n  return ret;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that these APIs avoid introducing statefulness/hysteresis into `computed` and don't specify the exact timing of when the cleanup function will be called (sidestepping https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56186#issuecomment-2173063032).\r\n\r\nA similar API could be adopted for `signal` too, though, since changes are fully user-controlled, it's easy make a wrapper that does the cleanup immediately before calling `set`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- document workarounds:\r\n  - Angular documentation should commit to the position that situations like this *require* piping though RxJS or an `effect` with `allowSignalWrites`\r\n  - Angular documentation should point users to the \"hack\" of saving the previous value in a closure (or to a nicely-packaged version of that hack, e.g. ngxtension's [`extendedComputed`](https://ngxtension.netlify.app/utilities/signals/computed/) or [`computedPrevious`](https://ngxtension.netlify.app/utilities/signals/computed-previous/))\r\n\r\n### See also:\r\n- #56186\r\n-

Only when the custom rAF- scheduled `detectChanges()` call triggered would `ngOnChanges` be called.\r\n\r\n * CD always ran multiple times, because of the above. `NgZone.run` would trigger CD, and then separately the scheduler would trigger CD.\r\n\r\n * Signal inputs were not supported, since inputs were set via direct property writes.\r\n\r\nThis change refactors the custom element implementation with two changes:\r\n\r\n1. `ComponentRef.setInput` is used instead of a custom code path for writing inputs.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to drop all the custom logic related to managing `ngOnChanges`, since `setInput` does that under the hood. `ngOnChanges` behavior now matches how the component would behave when _not_ rendered as a custom element.\r\n\r\n2. The custom rAF-based CD scheduler is removed.\r\n\r\nRunning `NgZone.run` is sufficient to trigger CD when zones are used, and the hybrid zoneless scheduler now ensures CD is scheduled when `setInput` is called even with no ZoneJS enabled.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this change, the elements tests have been significantly refactored. Previously all of Angular was faked/spied, which had a number of downsides. For example, there were tests which asserted that change detection only happens once when setting multiple inputs. This wasn't actually the case (because of `NgZone.run` - see logic above) but the test didn't catch the issue because it was only spying on `detectChanges()` which isn't called from `ApplicationRef.tick()`. Even the components were fake.\r\n\r\nNow, the tests use real Angular components and factories. They've also been updated to not use `fakeAsync`.\r\n\r\nA number of tests have been disabled, which were previously asserting behavior that wasn't matching what was actually happening (as above). Other tests were disabled due to real differences with `ngOnChanges` behavior, where the current behavior could be seen as a bug.\r\n\r\nFixes #53981","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56728","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(elements): switch to `ComponentRef.setInput` & remove custom scheduler\" (#56728)"},{"Id":"2376416769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T23:09:16","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"56727","RawContent":null,"Title":"Image instruction","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits. \r\n\r\n----\r\nContext: The Aurora team would like to add support in the `NgOptimizedImage` directive for automatic detection of file sizes when the file is a locale file. \r\n\r\nThis feature would be implemented in 2 steps: \r\n1.

To enable the optimization, script optimization must be enabled as well as an environment variable `NG_BUILD_OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS=1`. This build step uses `rollup` internally to process the build files directly in memory. The main bundling performs all resolution, bundling, and tree-shaking of the application. The chunk optimizer step then only needs to access the in-memory built files and does not need to perform any disk access or module resolution. This allows the step to be performed fairly quickly but it does add time to the overall production build. The `NG_BUILD_DEBUG_PERF=1` environment variable can be used to view how long the step takes within a build via the `OPTIMIZE_CHUNKS` entry. In the future, this optimization step may be automatically enabled based on initial file entry count and size. There are several current known issues:\r\n1) Bundle budgets for named lazy chunks may not work as expected.\r\n2) The console output may not show names (files will be present) for lazy chunk files.\r\n3) The stats file (`--stats-json` option) will not exactly reflect the final written application files.

It is the preferred option for new projects and we think migrating to it is a good idea. But we have found a small issue with how the static assets are served compared to the previous `browser` builder.\r\n\r\nOur application requires a bunch of static files to work, and one of the html files is accessed using the parent folder name without a trailing slash: `localhost:4200/oauth2redirect`. Using the previous builder this was loading the `oauth2redirect/index.html` file.\r\n\r\nAfter migrating to the new `application` builder, this same URI throws the following error:\r\n```\r\nError: NG04002: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'oauth2redirect'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by adding a trailing slash to the URI (`localhost:4200/oauth2redirect/`). But this would require updating our OAuth redirect uri. And since this is something already supported by other tools and platforms (Google Cloud Buckets for example), I think it may be a good idea to support it here as well.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nAdd some static `index.html` to an angular project:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/\r\n  app/...\r\n  static/\r\n    oauth2redirect/\r\n      index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n// angular.json\r\n\"assets\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n    \"input\": \"src/static\",\r\n    \"output\": \"/\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nServe the app\r\n```sh\r\nng serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd try to load the file by using its parent folder.\r\n\r\nAll three URIs work with previous `browser` builder. And the first one fails with the new `application`  builder.\r\n```sh\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect # => error\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect/ # => loads the file\r\nlocalhost:4200/oauth2redirect/index.hmtl # => loads the file\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 18.20.3\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.3.10\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.8\r\n@angular/material               17.3.10\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.8\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27949","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"serve: serving static files using vite differs from the previous builder\" (#27949)"},{"Id":"2375719843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-27T11:45:48","Actor":"kees-wiegel-visma","Number":"27936","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular.json budgets not finding the created bundles","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nWe have a lot of different bundles defined in our project, and each of those bundles has budgets assigned.

beefed up system running Ubuntu nativly.\r\n\r\n## Procedures to replicate\r\n\r\n1. Attempted to start a new project via `ng new my-proj` (SASS, no SSR/SSG/Prerendering)\r\n2. `ng new` hangs after selecting `n` to SSR on CREATE test/public/favicon.ico (15086 bytes)\r\n3. `ctrl-c` out of `ng new` and `rm -rf my-proj`\r\n4.

I have left it running for upwards of 20 minutes, and it is still hanging. \r\n\r\nAlso, during the process of writing this, I did get it to finish a hung `ng new`, but it took over 45 minutes.

With Angular 18 and new `@angular/build:application` builder it's no longer possible to script this task.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be niche feature request. But tracking budgets helps to see, how the size changes overtime.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWhen I run `build`, I'd like to have cli option that would update `angular.json` file and the budgets section. It's tedious to update that file manually.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI have a script for this task but it does not work with the new builder. The produced `stats.json` does not have enough information. There is no information which chunks are initial and which are loaded later. Also, I'm not sure how I could map the chunks to budgets in angular.json. Before the stats.json had the same chunkName and it could be just compared with the angular.json file.\r\n\r\nThis method was also nice, because I could print table that compared the values from angular.json and stats.json and see difference. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to expose the data that builder clearly has when it prints the output table? With that data, I could update my script to work.\r\n\r\nAt least there seems to be a way to convert entryPoint to chunkName: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/5b81e0f310609ceefaa09342722163233c14b47c/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/budget-stats.ts#L46-L48","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Option to update budgets when building app or export list of initial chunk files\" (#27941)"},{"Id":"2376003747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T18:26:57","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"27939","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.0.6 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27939","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.0.6 release\" (#27939)"},{"Id":"2375949567","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T18:21:59","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"27938","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.0.6\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27938","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.0.6\" with changelog.\" (#27938)"},{"Id":"2375690930","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-26T16:27:06","Actor":"fhaag","Number":"27935","RawContent":null,"Title":"dev-server executor expects certain options, but error message does not give away how to solve","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nrun\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUsing another target for `dev-server` than `build` results in an unclear error message.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nIn my `project.json` file, I have a `testserve` target that uses the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server` executor:\r\n```json\r\n\"testserve\": {\r\n\t\"executor\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\r\n\t\"configurations\": {\r\n\t\t\"development\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"buildTarget\": \"myProject:build:development\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"defaultConfiguration\": \"development\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n`build` is another target in the same `project.json` file. When invoking `nx run testserve`, this works flawlessly.\r\n\r\nNow, I have declared a new target for testing purposes:\r\n```json\r\n\"testoutput\": {\r\n\t\"command\": \"echo 'TEST'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOn its own, that target works - `nx run testoutput` results in the text `TEST` to be printed to the console.\r\n\r\nThen, I have tried to use that target for `dev-server` instead of `build`:\r\n```json\r\n\"testserve\": {\r\n\t\"executor\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\r\n\t\"configurations\": {\r\n\t\t\"development\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"buildTarget\": \"myProject:testoutput\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"defaultConfiguration\": \"development\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\nThe expected outcome of invoking `nx run testserve` is that it will output the text `TEST`, and maybe repeat to do so whenever the live reload of `dev-server` strikes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the actual outcome is this error:\r\n> TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"paths[1]\" argument must be of type string.

This means ES2015 code compiled to ES5 will not work with a native implementation of Custom Elements. To support browsers that natively support Custom Elements but not ES2015 modules, we load `@webcomponents/custom-elements/src/native-shim.js`, which minimally augments the native implementation to be compatible with ES5 code.\r\n    (See [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webcomponents/custom-elements#es5-vs-es2015) for more details.)\r\n\r\n    Previously, the shim was included in `polyfills.ts`, which meant it was loaded in all browsers (even those supporting ES2015 modules and thus not needing the shim).\r\n\r\n    This commit moves the shim from `polyfills.ts` to a `nomodule` script tag in `index.html`. This will ensure that it is only loaded in browsers that do not support ES2015 modules and thus do not needed the shim.\r\n\r\n    NOTE:\r\n    This commit also reduces size of the polyfills bundle by ~400B (52609B --> 52215B).\r\n\r\n- **fix(docs-infra): fix angular.io on IE 11:**\r\n    Previously, the angular.io app was broken on IE 11.

So that `src/robots.prod.txt` is moved to `src/robots.txt` bevore running the compiler.

  add second argument to self accept error handler to pass new module and module id\n    -   add error handler argument to dependency accept, passing error and module ids\n-   add `output.strictModuleErrorHandling` to opt into stricter evaluation error handling semantics according to ESM spec\n    -   used by default when HMR is enabled\n-   when ignoring a module used by `new URL()` this will result in an url to a empty file (`\"data:,\"`)\n-   add `module.generator.asset.emit` option to disable creating assets from asset modules (e. g. for SSR)\n\n##### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix problem when library options apply to a non-runtime chunk\n-   fix crash in `splitChunks.maxSize` where negative indicies are accessed\n-   fix sub-optimal splitting of `splitChunks.maxSize` in some cases when multiple size types are involved\n-   fix a memory leak in AssetGenerator\n-   fix usage of runtime globals in SharedPlugin to support HMR updates\n\n##### Deprecations\n\n-   deprecate `output.strictModuleExceptionHandling` (this is the CommonJS way of handling errors, and the name is weird)\n\n### [`v5.24.4`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.24.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.24.3...v5.24.4)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix overridding built-in externals via `externals`\n-   fix handling UNC paths as windows paths\n-   Improve error when passing an empty array as library name\n-   avoid adding the package.json from compilation context as build dependency\n-   fix expansion of `\"...\"` in array configuration options when it's not at the start\n\n### [`v5.24.3`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.24.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.24.2...v5.24.3)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix contenthash when a file is emitted twice with different filenames but that same contenthash\n\n### [`v5.24.2`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.24.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.24.1...v5.24.2)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix invalid syntax generated for destructuring with default values\n-   fix some incorrect properties accesses in watch\n    -   `modifiedFiles` and `removedFiles` were undefined\n-   fix some edge cases with MultiCompiler\n\n### [`v5.24.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.24.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.24.0...v5.24.1)\n\n### Performance\n\n-   improve performance of finding modules to concatenate\n-   improve performance of getting incoming modules from connections\n-   make sure that all serialized modules restore correctly\n-   avoid storing ConcatenatedModule, since that's not needed\n\n### Developer Experience\n\n-   fix typo in deprecation message\n\n### [`v5.24.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v5.24.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.23.0...v5.24.0)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   fix name conflict when using destructing with default arguments in concatenated modules\n-   fix tracking of reexports in concatenated modules when using multiple `export *` that point to the same export\n-   debug logging is now included even if logging is not\n-   fix name of ModuleConcatenationPlugin logger\n-   fix `experiments.lazyCompilation: true`.

This could allow `ng build --configuration production` to change the config used by other tools and affect their builds as well. This allows other tools in a project to be more intelligent about the intent of a build and do what the user expects.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThere are a couple possible implementations of this.\r\n\r\n1. Set an environment variable like `NG_BUILD_CONFIGS=\"foo,bar,baz\"`. Then config files could do something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst enableOptimizations = process.env['NG_BUILD_CONFIGS'].split(',').includes('production');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would decouple the Angular CLI from any specific tools and allow the individual tool configs to define the semantics for each configuration. Similarly, the semantics for each configuration are also defined directly in the tool's config file rather than `angular.json`. That seems weird to me, but arguably it's a benefit so :man_shrugging:. It also means that the config needs some knowledge of Angular, which isn't too bad considering its in the config, not the tool library, but this can still be undesirable.\r\n\r\n2. Add an `env` option in `angular.json`. Each configuration in the `angular.json` file could include an `env` map that looks like:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"my-project\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"env\": {\r\n              \"MY_BUILD_ENV\": \"development\",\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n        \"configurations\": {\r\n          \"production\": {\r\n            \"env\": {\r\n              \"MY_BUILD_ENV\": \"production\",\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI would parse and set the relevant environment variables during a build. Then tool configs could look for the project-specific environment variables like so:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst enableOptimizations = process.env['MY_BUILD_ENV'] === 'production';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would still give users full control over the semantics of any given environment variable and they can choose its value on a per-configuration basis. The challenges here include merging multiple configuration environment variables which might conflict and that this environment would apply to all tools used by the Angular CLI. Users might also break something by setting a variable they probably shouldn't (such as `PATH` or other system variables) and breaking the CLI.\r\n\r\n3. Just have users set the environment variable on the command line:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nMY_BUILD_ENV=\"production\" ng build --configuration production\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen use that variable in the tool config just like previously:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst enableOptimizations = process.env['MY_BUILD_ENV'] === 'production';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis requires no effort on the Angular CLI side and users can do this today. The downside here is that it requires special knowledge of how to build a particular app. A new developer would reasonably expect `ng build --configuration production` to do everything it needs to, and then be surprised something didn't optimize because they didn't set `MY_BUILD_ENV=\"production\"`. Projects could wrap such a command into an `npm run build:prod` which sets the variable, but not everyone will use it. This is also a cross platform issue, as I don't think there is a Unix and Windows compatible way of doing this (see [this question](https://superuser.com/questions/1405650/setting-environment-variables-for-windows-cmd-temporarily-to-run-a-program-in)), so supporting both environment for build is more hassle for the user.\r\n\r\nThere are likely other possible implementations that have their own trade offs. We'll need to discuss this more and come to a decision on how to move forward here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20253","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide Angular build context to external tool configuration files\" (#20253)"},{"Id":"829138055","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-11T14:59:59","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"20249","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): remove `project` from required properties in ng-packagr schema","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nCloses: #20246","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20249","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): remove `project` from required properties in ng-packagr schema\" (#20249)"},{"Id":"829045961","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-11T14:59:58","Actor":"silvioboehme","Number":"20246","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng config breaks with schema validation after library is added to workspace","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [x] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [x] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nThis works fine in version 11.2.3 and below and breaks with 11.2.4.\r\nIt's directly linked to commit 5f8155d\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nng new Demo1 --createApplication=false --newProjectRoot=apps --strict=true\r\ncd Demo1\r\nng config newProjectRoot apps\r\nng g application app1 --routing=true --style=scss  --strict=true\r\nng config newProjectRoot libs1\r\nng g library mylib1\r\nng config newProjectRoot libs2\r\n\r\nSchema validation failed with the following errors:\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should NOT be valid.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].builder\" should be equal to constant.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build'].configurations['production']\" should have required property 'project'.\r\n  Data path \".projects['mylib1'].architect['build']\" should match exactly one schema in oneOf.\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nBecause 5f8155d adds \"project\" key as required to \"configuration\" but ng g library don't add this key!\r\nI don't know why this is required now, but i think it's a bug in 5f8155d\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:ng-packagr\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"tsConfig\": \"libs1/mylib1/tsconfig.lib.json\",\r\n            \"project\": \"libs1/mylib1/ng-package.json\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n            \"production\": {\r\n              \"tsConfig\": \"libs1/mylib1/tsconfig.lib.prod.json\"\r\n                                            <----- missing \"project\" !!!!!\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20246","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng config breaks with schema validation after library is added to workspace\" (#20246)"},{"Id":"829116137","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-11T12:42:29","Actor":"saltdotac","Number":"20248","RawContent":null,"Title":"Symbol-observable version upgrade causes typing mismatch with rxjs \"unique symbol\"","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

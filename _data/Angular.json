We initially investigated whether there was a software error and could not see any messages or errors on either the console or the network on devtools. I encountered this error 1-2 times in the development environment. That's why we thought it was a browser-related error and suggested solving the problem with f5. But it was annoying. Then we noticed this change and decided to roll it back. After the change, we did not receive any messages from users that they no longer received this error and the problem was resolved.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n```true\r\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.6\r\nNode: 18.18.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                              Version\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect            0.1703.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular        17.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr     0.1002.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core                 17.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics           17.3.6\r\n@angular/cdk                         17.3.6\r\n@angular/cli                         17.3.6\r\n@angular/material                    17.3.6\r\n@angular/material-date-fns-adapter   17.3.6\r\n@angular/youtube-player              17.3.6\r\n@schematics/angular                  17.3.6\r\nrxjs                                 7.8.1\r\ntypescript                           5.4.5\r\nzone.js                              0.14.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55627","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Router config \"enableViewTransitions\" and \"Aw, Snap!\" error\" (#55627)"},{"Id":"2274346963","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-01T23:31:32","Actor":"twerske","Number":"55626","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add redirect banner to adev page","State":"open","Body":"Links to the most relevant ADEV page in the mapping\r\n\r\nCARETAKER NOTE:\r\nThis needs to be patched into all previous subdomains of vX.angular.io (v17, v16, v15 etc) to link to Angular.dev, since the banners on each one don't currently match.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55626","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: add redirect banner to adev page\" (#55626)"},{"Id":"2274329958","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-01T23:12:38","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"55625","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): mark `@defer` APIs as stable","State":"open","Body":"This commit removes the `@developerPreview` annotation from the `@defer` APIs, effectively promoting them (and the entire feature!) to stable.

previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a monorepo setup using npm workspaces, with `/app` containing the Angular application and `/common` containing some common classes, interfaces etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Angular app, in the `tsconfig` I have common set up as a project reference, and this is then made accessible within my angular code by a typical module reference (`@myorg/common`).\r\n\r\nWhen serving my app, I have typescript set up to watch any changes in the `/common` folder and rebuild, and before switching to the new Vite-based dev server this all worked fine: when doing an `ng serve`, then modifying a class in common, the app would be reloaded with the latest code.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the new server, because Vite caches node modules in `.angular/cache/v17.2.0/vite/deps`, and only refreshes it on package-lock changes, its caching my symlinked common module, and then ignoring any changes I make. Not only does this mean is not live reloading, but on subsequent runs, unless I modify the package lock or remove the cache, it will use a stale version of my common module.\r\n\r\nIn a pure Vite scenario, this would be resolved by adding a `vite.config.ts` file like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default {\r\n  optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@myorg/common'] }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've read several threads where modifying the Vite config doesn't seem to be possible or on the roadmap for the dev server, so I'm not sure how else I'm supposed to resolve this without disabling the cache entirely through `angular.json`, which removes a lot of the performance benefits. Appreciate any help!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create top-level npm workspace `package.json`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"repro\",\r\n  \"workspaces\": [\r\n    \"app\",\r\n    \"common\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. `mkdir app && mkdir common`\r\n3. Create a basic typescript library in `common` with a `package.json` and a basic class\r\n4. `cd app && ng new`\r\n5. Modify tsconfig to have project reference to common:\r\n```json\r\n\"references\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"path\": \"../common\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n6. Import the library class in the app component and use it\r\n7. Within `/common`, run `tsc -w` in one shell and keep running\r\n8. Within `/app`, run `ng serve`\r\n9. Modify the class in `common`. tsc will rebuild but angular dev server will not reload\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI:

I would like to have an option `infiniteScroll` or another, with a better name, which when set, would emit the next page or previous page events until the data-source returns an empty set, thus letting the user know that they have reached the end of the dataset. \n\n### Use Case\n\nThe total count of a table is normally found by counting all rows in relational dbs like PostgreSQL\r\n \r\n> [However both both forms of count(1) and count(*) are fundamentally slow. PostgreSQL uses multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) to ensure consistency between simultaneous transactions. This means each transaction may see different rows -- and different numbers of rows -- in a table. There is no single universal row count that the database could cache, so it must scan through all rows counting how many are visible. Performance for an exact count grows linearly with table size.](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/12/count-performance/#dup_counts_exact)\r\n\r\nMoreover, the resulting count is even slower when filters are applied.

Most of the time this is fine, because the logic that escapes the rule content to `%BLOCK%` will have converted it to something that won't be matched by the regex. However, it breaks down for rules like `@import` which don't have a body, but can still have quoted content with characters that can match the regex.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the issue by making a second pass over the escaped string and replacing all of the remaining quoted content with `%QUOTED%` before parsing it with the regex. Once everything has been processed, we make a final pass where we restore the quoted content.\r\n\r\nIn a previous iteration of this PR, I went with a shorter approach which narrowed down the regex so that it doesn't capture rules without a body. It fixed the issue, but it also ended up breaking some of the more contrived unit test cases. I decided not to pursue it further, because we would've ended up with a very long and brittle regex that likely would've broken in even weirder\r\nways.\r\n\r\nFixes #38587.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38716","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): incorrectly encapsulating @import containing colons and semicolons\" (#38716)"},{"Id":"693442536","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-04T17:55:22","Actor":"acohenOT","Number":"38715","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove duplicate trans-unit element closing tag","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

And thus blade layout. \r\n\r\nThis is of course very naive implementation. I already can see problem with how injector should handle that - should it be by like routes go or component outlets - this will probably be easier. \r\n\r\n### router outlet template\r\nOne more thing that would go well with this proposition it possibility to provide an template to router-outlet that would wrap each child\r\n```html\r\n<router-outlet template=\"wrapper\"></router-outlet>\r\n<ng-template #wrapper>\r\n    <div class=\"blade\"><ng-content></div>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n```typescript\r\n{ path: 'invoices', component: InvoicesBladeContainer, levelName: 'invoices', wrapperComponent: BladeWrapper,  children: [\r\n], }\r\n```\r\nhere wrapperComponent would be rendered as a wrapper for each child of this router outlet, and not rendered at all of no children would exists, for example when exact route would be hit.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38708","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Multiple components from one router outlet.\" (#38708)"},{"Id":"692746915","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-04T05:44:07","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"38707","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Ensure that `previousOrParentTNode` always belongs to current `TView`.","State":"open","Body":"`previousOrParentTNode` stores current `TNode`.

Currently, the date pipe gets a time zone as an optional parameter if there is no such parameter then gets the current zone of the client. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWe could achieve that with an injection token just like the LOCALE one.\r\n\r\nI could implement that. My plan is to create a new injection token called TIME_ZONE in the **/i18n/tokens.ts**. Then we could inject that token in the application_module.ts with a default value your local time zone. Once we have that we could inject that token in the date pipe and pass that value to the **formatDate** method.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38696","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Time zone globally\" (#38696)"},{"Id":"691809389","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-03T09:34:48","Actor":"diksha-v","Number":"38695","RawContent":null,"Title":"KeyValue pipe does not support custom object type","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/core@9.0.2\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Not sure, never turned on full template type check on before v9\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> using keyvalue pipe for custom object type throws \"No overload matches this call.\" error\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ehsope\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nNo overload matches this call.\r\nThe last overload gave the following error.\r\nArgument of type 'Employee' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Map<unknown, unknown>'.\r\nType 'Employee' is missing the following properties from type 'Map<unknown, unknown>': clear, delete, forEach, get, and 8 more.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.3\r\nNode: 10.19.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.3\r\n@angular/cli                       9.0.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.3\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.3\r\nng-packagr                         9.1.1\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.7.5\r\nwebpack                            4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

In Angular 7 one can make the columns of a material table drag and drop-able to change their display order: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-mat-table-columns-draggable\r\nThis works fine in Angular 7\r\n2.  In Angular 10 the approach does not work anymore:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-jnnkb2?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftable-basic-example.ts\r\n3.

Columns can be dragged and dropped to change their order in the table.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\nThe columns can be dragged in Angular 10, but the drop event is never triggered. This means the logic to reorder the columns in a table is not triggered and thus their order is not changed.

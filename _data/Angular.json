To build it I use webpack, AngularCompilerPlugin and `localize-translate` script. The problem is `xlf` extracting . I have no angular.json config, so I cannot use `ng xi18n`. To use `i18nOutFile` option I have to disable Ivy temporary. This is not convenient and I think it stops working with some Ivy-specific features in templates. The documentation does not have any guide for that case.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> https://angular.io/guide/i18n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38545","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing documentation on localization scripts\" (#38545)"},{"Id":"681789553","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T14:24:37","Actor":"SalvadorFuture","Number":"38529","RawContent":null,"Title":"angular 8: aplicacion PWA error 404 not found ngsw-worke.js ","State":"closed","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a PWA application that worked perfectly, but now loading the application in production shows the following error:\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1MW2eTMfQfIGj5ncpO-nNPEiR4LAPWht_/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I access the application from Chrome with an incognito window or CTRL + F5 then the application loads correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that it has something to do with the cache but I cannot configure the application to work properly without having to clear the cache or with a Chrome window in incognito.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the local development environment everything works OK\r\n\r\nThe problems appear after building and uploading the application to the production server.\r\n\r\nThe content of the ngsw.json file can be seen in the following image:\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiC7ddw6Y6P2mhzfVmR9fqZ-wDO1T2d7/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThe angular versión I'm working is:\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.17\r\nNode: 12.13.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nPlease, can you help me?\r\n\r\nThe url aplication with this error is:  https://residenciasuniversitarias.ulpgc.es/areaprivadapwa/login\r\n\r\nThanks a lot","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38529","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"angular 8: aplicacion PWA error 404 not found ngsw-worke.js \" (#38529)"},{"Id":"682447261","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T11:19:29","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"38543","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): support TypeScript 4.0 ","State":"closed","Body":"Ground work to support both TypeScript 3.9 and 4.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38543","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): support TypeScript 4.0 \" (#38543)"},{"Id":"682544440","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T08:58:14","Actor":"bobKasbi","Number":"38544","RawContent":null,"Title":"Localized bundle generation failed: Unexpected return value from helper (expected a call expression)","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/localize\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nthe previous version in which this bug was not present was: Angular 8.x\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading the app to angular 9 and then 10 when I run <code>ng build appName --configuration=production</code> localy it works.

If needed, we could expose the entire AST\r\npath, or expose other methods to provide more context for a node.\r\n\r\nNote that due to limitations in the template AST interface, there are\r\na few known cases where microsyntax spans are not recorded properly.\r\nThis will be dealt with in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

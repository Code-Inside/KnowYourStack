The workarounds for which are non-trivial.\r\n\r\nIntercepting the constructor call is useful for:\r\n\r\n- Saving a reference to the class instance\r\n- Obtaining a reference to the node/module injector via `inject`\r\n- Running initialization logic when the class is created\r\n\r\nLibrary authors in the Angular ecosystem are currently limited to using private Angular APIs to work around this, against the advice of Angular team. \r\n\r\nA few examples in the wild:\r\n- [Microwave](https://github.com/jscutlery/devkit/blob/6e29efd2ca34336c21b5a3088dd35df8baeec6c8/packages/microwave/src/lib/shared/decorator.ts#L165)\r\n- [NGXS](https://github.com/ngxs/store/blob/050bc58ab5481cafdeb5cfdc365b4e58515e48ee/packages/store/internals/src/decorator-injector-adapter.ts) (was reverted in later versions due to conflicts)\r\n- [My own project](https://github.com/antischematic/angular-state-library/blob/de2a4ce2f777260076ff61450831fea2eb93eac5/projects/core/src/core.ts#L105)\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAngular should recognize valid use cases for meta-programming and provide a public API for library authors to use. All solutions here are intended to work within existing AOT compilation constraints.\r\n\r\n**Solution 1: add a ngOnCreate lifecycle hook**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction setup(instance, injector) {\r\n  // run initialization logic\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component()\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  ngOnCreate() {\r\n    setup(this, inject(INJECTOR))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `ngOnCreate` hook would run directly after invoking the injected class constructor. It runs in the same injection context as the constructor making it possible to use `inject`. Decorators can then attach this hook to the prototype.\r\n\r\n**Solution 2: add `useFactory` metadata**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction setup() {\r\n  const injector = inject(INJECTOR)\r\n  const instance = new AppComponent()\r\n  // run initialization logic\r\n  return instance\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  useFactory: setup\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis aligns with `Injectable`, allowing us to override the component factory.\r\n\r\n**Solution 3: add features metadata**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction setup(componentDef) {\r\n  const { factory } = componentDef;\r\n\r\n  componentDef.factory = (type) => {\r\n    const instance = factory(type);\r\n    const injector = inject(INJECTOR);\r\n\r\n    // run initialization logic\r\n\r\n    return instance;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  features: [setup]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake the compiled class definition a public API that can be modified at runtime.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n**Alternative 1: Override the class factory**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction CustomDecorator() {\r\n  return function (target) {\r\n    const factory = target['ɵfac']\r\n    target['ɵfac'] = function (...args) {\r\n      const injector = inject(INJECTOR)\r\n      const instance = factory(...args)\r\n      return instance \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@CustomDecorator()\r\n@Component()\r\nexport class AppComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe approach is to decorate the `ɵfac` property which is a private Angular API. This needs special handling to account for different behaviours in JIT and AOT compilation modes.\r\n\r\n**Alternative 2: Access the constructor with a base class**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component()\r\nexport class AppComponent extends BaseComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this isn't ideal since the base constructor is called before all properties have initialized.\r\n\r\n**Alternative 3: Explicitly pass in initialization logic through the constructor**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction setup(instance, injector) {\r\n  // decorator initialization logic\r\n}\r\n\r\n@CustomDecorator()\r\n@Component()\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    // class initialization logic\r\n    setup(this, inject(INJECTOR))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this defeats the purpose. It also requires consumers to place the call at the end of the constructor after all other initialization is done. Decorators should be self-contained.\r\n\r\n**Alternative 4: Don't use decorators**\r\n\r\n🙁","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47713","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide a way to obtain the injector outside a class constructor for meta-programming\" (#47713)"},{"Id":"1402138898","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-09T03:46:13","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"47711","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency @rollup/plugin-commonjs to v23","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@rollup/plugin-commonjs](https://togithub.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs/#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/rollup/plugins)) | peerDependencies | major | [`^22.0.0` -> `^23.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@rollup%2fplugin-commonjs/22.0.2/23.0.0) |\n| [@rollup/plugin-commonjs](https://togithub.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs/#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/rollup/plugins)) | dependencies | major | [`^22.0.0` -> `^23.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@rollup%2fplugin-commonjs/22.0.1/23.0.0) |\n| [@rollup/plugin-commonjs](https://togithub.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs/#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/rollup/plugins)) | devDependencies | major | [`^22.0.0` -> `^23.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@rollup%2fplugin-commonjs/22.0.1/23.0.0) |\n| [@rollup/plugin-commonjs](https://togithub.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs/#readme) ([source](https://togithub.com/rollup/plugins)) | devDependencies | major | [`^22.0.0` -> `^23.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@rollup%2fplugin-commonjs/22.0.2/23.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Dependency Lookup Warnings ⚠\n\nWarnings were logged while processing this repo.

The localization works btw. It does use the `lv` locale by default now but I want this to be dynamic from the url.

If I can't solve this with native angular, then I will just switch to some other solution which seems counter productive to what angular would want e.g. https://www.freakyjolly.com/switch-multiple-languages-i18n-using-ngx-translate-in-angular-12/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nNo exception.

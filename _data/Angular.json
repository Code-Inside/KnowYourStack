This is an implementation of `HttpParameterCodec`\r\nwhich uses `encodeURIComponent` plus a number of manual post-processing\r\nsubstitutions to encode keys and values for x-www-form-urlencoded contexts.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the logic of `HttpUrlEncodingCodec` is fatally flawed. Among\r\nother problems, the character '+' is left unencoded. In such contexts, '+'\r\nis interpeted as a space by any correct decoder, meaning that this\r\nimplementation actually changes values. This logic is indefensible, and\r\nappears to be the result of a copy/paste bug from angular.js encoding meant\r\nfor a different context.\r\n\r\nFixing this bug directly is challenging since existing backends may be\r\nrelying on Angular's broken behavior, so changing the default is a breaking\r\nchange and will need to be done in an Angular major version. This commit\r\nbegins that process by introducing a new codec, `HttpUrlComponentCodec`,\r\nwhich implements a corrected encoding algorithm. In a future commit for v11,\r\nthis corrected codec can be made the default.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, this commit introduces a static method which can change the\r\nbuilt-in default codec, for convenience.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nHttpParams.setDefaultParameterCodec(HttpUrlComponentCodec);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee #11058 for more details.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37385","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(http): provide alternative to broken HttpUrlEncodingCodec\" (#37385)"},{"Id":"628752787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T21:53:06","Actor":"jbogarthyde","Number":"37384","RawContent":null,"Title":"Navigation type should be interface so it can be documented","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n`@angular/router`\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe property documentation strings that are present in the file do not render because this is a type.

This is because loading such JS file requires these DOM\r\nglobals to exist in NodeJS globally too (and there is no support for DI mocking).\r\nSee: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30586. This is especially\r\nrelevant for libraries that do not want to use tsickle but ship SSR-compatible code.\r\n\r\nThe root cause for (1) is a TypeScript limitation as mentioned. This is\r\nthe related upstream ticket: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27519.\r\nDownleveling decorators to static properties fixes the issues, as\r\noutlined in (1) and (2), because we can defer metadata evaluation\r\nto avoid direct evaluation on file load. Additionally, we have more\r\ncontrol and can discard unnnecessary metadata information, like class\r\nmember types that are not needed by Angular at all see (2).\r\n\r\nOne might wonder why this hasn't been an issue in the past since we disabled\r\nthis as part of version 7. These issues didn't surface at a large scale because\r\nwe added a custom transformer to CLI projects and to `ng-packagr`. Those\r\ntransformers downleveled constructor parameters to fix (1) and (2). Also\r\n`emitMetadataDecorator` has been disabled by default in CLI projects.\r\nFor bazel release output this didn't surface either because tsickle\r\nstill ran by default in prodmode output.\r\n\r\nThis was never an ideal solution though, and we'd also like to not\r\nrun tsickle by default in the Bazel prodmode output. It was not ideal\r\nbecause we just applied workarounds at Angular compiler derivatives.\r\nIdeally, TypeScript would just emit proper metadata that isn't evaluated\r\nat top-level, but given they marked it as limitation and the decorator\r\nproposal is still stage 2, this won't happen any time soon (if at all).\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution is that we downlevel decorators (as previously done\r\nwith tsickle by default) as part of the Angular compiler (a level higher;\r\nand one below the actual TypeScript compiler limitation). This fixes\r\nthe issues with the common `forwardRef` pattern (1), and also fixes (2).\r\nIt also allows us to reduce workarounds in the compiler derivatives\r\n(i.e. CLI and ng-packagr), and we can disable tsickle in Angular bazel\r\n(as already done with this commit).\r\n\r\nFixes #30106.

Here user will set row + someId  like {{row.someId}} and that will be passed along with grid data, grid options and grid columns to work. \r\n\r\n<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages the are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> This feature request is for @angular/....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem or missing capability...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37374","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How to set child component angular expression from parant model string value like passing expression {{row.parentId}} as string? \" (#37374)"},{"Id":"628222892","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T08:05:30","Actor":"waqaxs","Number":"37373","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat paginator show undefined with ngIf condition but only works with show/hide directive","State":"closed","Body":"üõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n\r\nPlease help us process issues more efficiently by filing an\r\nissue using one of the following templates:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/new/choose\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37373","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Mat paginator show undefined with ngIf condition but only works with show/hide directive\" (#37373)"},{"Id":"628219573","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T07:32:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"37372","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(core): avoid pulling in jit-specific code in aot bundles","State":"open","Body":"In #29083 a call to `getCompilerFacade` was added to `ApplicationRef` which pulls in a bit of JIT-specific code.

Please look at this problem here: [#15677](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15677)\r\n\r\n**Explanation**\r\nSuppose we have some modules like listed below:\r\n\r\n‚îå Parent module   (e.g. exists some data resolvers for every child path)\r\n‚îú Child module 1\r\n‚îú Child module 2\r\n\r\n**Unexpected behavior**\r\n1. **Action**: navigate from the parent to the child path. (**parent -> child**)\r\n    **Effect**: Route is changed. Resolvers works fine. Data is changed. Component view is updated.\r\n2. **Action**: navigate from the child to the parent path. (**child -> parent**)\r\n    **Effect**: Route is changed. Resolvers works fine. Data is changed. Component view is updated.\r\n3. **Action**: navigate between children modules(the same parent module for both). (**child <-> child**)\r\n    **Effect**: Route is changed. Resolvers works fine. Data is changed. **But** component view state **is the same** (old state).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nComponent view should be updated when we navigate between children of the same parent module, because route is changed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.4\r\nNode: 12.13.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.4\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.2\r\n@angular/material                 9.2.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.4\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37365","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Route data is not updated when upstream parameters change, reopen: #15677\" (#37365)"},{"Id":"627927268","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-31T10:16:39","Actor":"NishanthRE","Number":"37364","RawContent":null,"Title":"AppInitializer allows to load the submodule before getting the config values","State":"closed","Body":"üõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n\r\nHi Team,\r\n              I am working in the mono repo project which is consist of many angular projects and angular custom libraries.

If the code change or is incorrect, the return type inference will reflect that.\r\n\r\nWhile it is acceptable in applications, as it will raise an error where the function is used if the types do not match anymore, it is more dangerous in a library, as the functions are not used directly. It can lead to unwanted breaking changes in the public API.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nTSLint has a rule to enforce functions' return type (and ESLint too, for the future migration):\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"rules\": {\r\n    \"typedef\": [true, \"call-signature\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt could be added when doing `ng g library`.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy change as:\r\n- it won't impact applications: libraries already have a specific `tslint.json` due to `--prefix` option\r\n- it won't impact already created libraries as it only happens when generating a new one\r\n\r\nThis is a really easy thing to add, I can take care of the PR if Angular team signal is green.\r\n\r\nIf it is considered a too big step, it could be added only if the workspace is already using TypeScript `strict` mode (following the new `--strict` option in Angular >= 9). But I think as we are talking about libraries, it should really be the default: libraries authors must be stricter to avoid compatibility issues (`strict` mode should even be the default for libraries, but it would be another discussion).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17821","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Enforce stricter types via lint when in strict mode\" (#17821)"},{"Id":"628350599","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T18:52:02","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"17833","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devklit/build-angular): clean up SingleTestTransformLoader","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nMinor cleanup of SingleTestTransformLoader and fix interface issue which causes  #17823 to be red.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17833","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devklit/build-angular): clean up SingleTestTransformLoader\" (#17833)"},{"Id":"628451041","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T13:47:38","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"17835","RawContent":null,"Title":"wip! jsonc-parser","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17835","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"wip! jsonc-parser\" (#17835)"},{"Id":"627892123","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T13:06:26","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"17829","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update rollup to version 2.12.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup)) | dependencies | minor | [`2.11.2` -> `2.12.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/2.11.2/2.12.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup</summary>\n\n### [`v2.12.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;2120)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v2.11.2...v2.12.0)\n\n_2020-05-31_\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Add an option `--waitForBundleInput` to let the build wait until all entry point files are available before starting ([#&#8203;3577](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3577))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;3577](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3577): Wait for bundle input option ([@&#8203;Heerschop](https://togithub.com/Heerschop))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Everything seemed fine, but as soon as I started changing JSON files in my assets folder (assets/api/test.json) I noticed a problem. Webpack registers the change I make to the file, but the old file is still served. \r\n\r\nSay I add a record to the JSON file `{ \"foo\": \"bar\" }`, the compiler sees the change and starts compiling. After that the webpage is refreshed (like expected), but the JSON file is not updated, the previous version is still served. \r\n\r\nIn order to check if my project was the problem I created a new, empty, CLI project (Angular CLI 9.0.4). I am having the same issue here. It is not even picking up any now JSON files I add to the assets folder. It does add them in the build folder on a production build, but the files are missing on `serve`. \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nSee [this minimal reproduction](https://github.com/RobinvanTienhoven/test-asset-loading).\r\nChange a line in the `assets/api/test.json`. Angular will update the app, but the http call will still return a 404 not found on the file.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nNo error code\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.4\r\nNode: 12.10.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\nIvy Workspace:\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.900.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core         9.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   9.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular          9.0.4\r\n@schematics/update           0.900.4\r\nrxjs                         6.5.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17828","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 9 assets not updating\" (#17828)"},{"Id":"627700158","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-30T10:32:55","Actor":"ilprima","Number":"17826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 9 Lazy Loading with arrow functions no chunks and big main.js","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

While most of the assets, that are set in the icon registry are fetched successfully, some randomly fail.\r\n\r\nThe CORS policy is set, on the AWS bucket that serves my assets through CDN, and allows all `GET` requests. All assets there (js, fonts, images. etc.) are served successfully.\r\n\r\nAlso this is how the SVG files are registered in my app:\r\n```\r\nthis.matIconRegistry.addSvgIcon(\r\n  'houseGray', this.domSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(require('../../../assets/img/regular/house--shuttle-gray.svg'))\r\n);\r\n```\r\n##### Note: I use `require()` because I want the asset path to be prefixed with the `deploy-url` when I build for production.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the assets are fetched successfully, sometimes, some fail due to CORS. I noticed that the requests that fail, are missing the HTTP method in the request and I was wondering how this can be possible.\r\n\r\nThis is a successful request:\r\n```\r\nRequest URL: https://my-staging-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/admin/9e8ed37372ddebdad28dc758d0422fd1682cd47c/house--shuttle-gray.70463f6a5833405a53d8.svg\r\nRequest Method: GET\r\nStatus Code: 200 OK\r\nRemote Address: 52.216.114.35:443\r\nReferrer Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade\r\n```\r\nThis is an unsuccessful request that leads to CORS error:\r\n```\r\nRequest URL: https://my-staging-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/admin/9e8ed37372ddebdad28dc758d0422fd1682cd47c/house--shuttle-gray.70463f6a5833405a53d8.svg\r\nReferrer Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade\r\n```\r\nNote, that on the latter, the HTTP request method is missing.\r\n\r\nThis behavior even happens with (non-cached) assets that were previously fetched successfully (like my example). Seems like that this behavior is a little random, regarding which assets are affected and when.\r\n\r\nWhat's noteworthy is that this happens on Chromium based browser and Safari, but not with Firefox (all at their latest version at the time of writing)\r\n\r\nSince the HTTP request is handled by the MatIconRegistry, I was hoping you got an idea on what's going on here and if it's possible for a request to be missing the HTTP request method.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\n- Tried to change the path of the asset\r\n- Allowed all HTTP methods on my CORS policy\r\n- Checked that the file exists on my CDN\r\n- Checked the validity of the code of the SVG file\r\n- Fetched the SVG file alone with a `GET` request from the same address that was failiing\r\n- Changed the target of my build in `tsconfig` from `es5` to `es6` hoping that the request will be created in some other way\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't provide my environment for testing on the issue, because the bucket belongs to a company and it accepts requests from specific origins\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Register svg files in the MatIconRegistry\r\n2. Use `require()` to set the file path\r\n3. Set a `deploy-url` to a different origin and allow GET requests in CORS policy\r\n4.

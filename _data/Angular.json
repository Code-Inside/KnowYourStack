I believe its related to service worker because:\r\n\r\n 1. On localhost (ng serve) I do not have these issues.\r\n 2. If I chose to **Bypass for network** in the DevTools>Application panel in production, the issue also disappears\r\n\r\nWhen videos are loading their source via service worker, they will result in source not found error and the entire media player will fail to work.\r\n\r\nMy video component is extremely simple\r\n```html\r\n<video preload=\"metadata\"\r\n       [poster]=\"poster\"\r\n       muted\r\n       controls\r\n       #videoElement\r\n>\r\n  <source #sourceElement (error)=\"onSourceError($event)\" [src]=\"src\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\n</video>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe event from onSourceError callback does not provide much valuable information about the problem.\r\n\r\nMy ngsw-config.json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"./node_modules/@angular/service-worker/config/schema.json\",\r\n  \"index\": \"/index.html\",\r\n  \"assetGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"app\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n          \"/favicon.ico\",\r\n          \"/index.html\",\r\n          \"/manifest.webmanifest\",\r\n          \"/*.css\",\r\n          \"/*.js\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"assets\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"lazy\",\r\n      \"updateMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n          \"/assets/**\",\r\n          \"/*.(eot|svg|cur|jpg|png|webp|gif|otf|ttf|woff|woff2|ani|mp4)\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"dataGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"firebase-storage\",\r\n      \"urls\": [\r\n        \"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/**\",\r\n        \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/**\",\r\n        \"https://fonts.gstatic.com/**\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"cacheConfig\": {\r\n        \"maxSize\": 1000,\r\n        \"maxAge\": \"15d\",\r\n        \"strategy\": \"freshness\",\r\n        \"timeout\": \"0s\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n1. Go to my site: https://tekken.guru (select bunch of different characters)\r\n2. Stick around long enough for service worker to do its magic\r\n3. Observe the media player being hopeless in playing the videos and crashing\r\n4. If you clear the service workers cache (ctrl+f5, Bypass for network or other means) the videos will work again briefly.\r\n\r\nOn this picture you can see the result of the error having **state-no-source**\r\n![alt text](https://i.postimg.cc/y84znT9k/ngswerror.jpg)\r\n\r\nI have tested this on multiple devices and have multiple people reporting me the same issue happening on my site.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nDifficult to provide when service worker runs only on https...

When code is reused between multiple applications and the code is developed by the same team, with the same update schedule of the applications using them, having these packages installed in `node_modules` but distributed in `vendor.js`, break many of the advantages of having a vendor file, like not needing to update it with every application minor update. Lets look at an example:\r\n\r\n- Application for the Healthcare market\r\n    - Uses @company/accounting package\r\n    - Uses @company/inventory package\r\n    - ...\r\n    - Functionally exclusive for Healthcare not on a separate package\r\n- Application for the Hospitality market\r\n    - Uses @company/accounting package\r\n    - Uses @company/inventory package\r\n    - ...\r\n    - Functionally exclusive for Hospitality not on a separate package\r\n\r\nThese two applications share code as separate packages, the problem with how Angular packages this by default, is that everything in `node_modules` is dumped on the `vendor.js` file, but it is better if they could be moved to `main.js`, this could reduce the need for clients to update `vendor.js` with every minor applications updates that don't change external dependencies versions.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nCurrently Angular CLI force everything on `node_modules` to `vendor.js`, check [the relevant code](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/b04cdc3a233c739063abd9b32bd8a3984a6ef1d5/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/webpack/configs/common.ts#L44). Enhancing this code and exporting that to an option on `angular.json` could be great.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThis probably could be done with git submodules to share code with multiple Angular workspaces, but I am trying not to do this since using the npm modules dependencies functionality sounds more manageable.

WIP.\r\n\r\n* Adds a new `MatTabNavPanel` component that is intended to be used with `MatTabNav`. `MatTabNavPanel` renders the `tabpanel`, `MatTabNav` renders the `tablist`.\r\n* Adds a new optional `[tabPanel]` input to `MatTabNav` that accepts a `MatTabNavPanel`. Allows `MatTabNav` to make changes to `MatTabNavPanel` (i.e. `aria-labelledby`).\r\n* If `[tabPanel]` is provided, `MatTabNav` acts as an ARIA tabs.

Why are there no stackblitz links demonstrating how to use the feature?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one example I did find elsewhere, was pretty much incomprehensible to me and would itself would require a lot of studying just to figure out what's going on.  The example is not constructed in the usual way, with components, templates etc., but instead builds the entire example in .ts files (no html or css templates) which makes it just really opaque to figure out how to actually use it in a conventional angular application.   (Also you can't even get to this example on this page -- you have to click through to the install page on https://material.io/develop/web/supporting/density and for some reason the example is hosted on something called \"Glitch\" rather than on Stackblitz, like _every other example code section in material.io_\r\n\r\nCan you do better here?

If the mat-dialog contains only an iframe element, focus trap does not constrain the focusable elements to those only inside the modal dialog. \r\n2.  The focus trap works if I add another element to the iframe (like a button), but I cannot use tab key to navigate to elements inside the iframe. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nI created two separate StackBlitz projects to repro those issues. \r\n1. This project is the entry point which contains a button to open a dialog and the content of the dialog. \r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-vqwhly?file=src/app/dialogs/dialog-content/dialog-content.component.html\r\n\r\n2. This project contains the content loaded in the iframe. \r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-34o8qo\r\nFor some reason, it cannot be loaded in the iframe of the dialog if you also open this link in your browser at the same time. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the first issue:\r\nOpen the first link, ensure that the button is commented out. <!-- <button mat-dialog-close=\"\">Close</button> -->\r\nOpen the dialog, use tab key to navigate all focusable elements. Verify that it is possible to move the focus outside of the dialog. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the second issue:\r\nOpen the first link and use the code editor to add the button back in dialog-content component. \r\nOpen the dialog and use tab key to test that focusable elements are restrained to those inside the dialog, but it cannot move the focus automatically inside elements of the iframe. You may use your mouse to click on the iframe and set focus inside, but after you focus out of the iframe using keyboard, you cannot use keyboard to focus on the elements inside the iframe again. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf the iframe is the only element inside the dialog-content, focusable elements should be constrained to those inside the modal dialog only. It should also autofocus on the first focusable element according to this doc: [ARIA: dialog role\r\n](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role#required_javascript_features)\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple elements inside the dialog-content, using keyboard should be able to navigate to all focusable elements no matter those elements are inside an iframe or not. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nTo reproduce the first issue:\r\nOpen the first link, ensure that the button is commented out. <!-- <button mat-dialog-close=\"\">Close</button> -->\r\nOpen the dialog, use tab key to navigate all focusable elements. Verify that it is possible to move the focus outside of the dialog. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the second issue:\r\nOpen the first link and use the code editor to add the button back in dialog-content component. \r\nOpen the dialog and use tab key to test that focusable elements are restrained to those inside the dialog, but it cannot move the focus automatically inside elements of the iframe.

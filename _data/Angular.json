would like to tell you my thoughts on how to make Angular the frontend king:\r\n- before introducing Signals, more careful considerations should have been made on how to make the developer experience better by using signals (thinking E2E and how to remove non-reactive component code), e.g. signals as component inputs and events, such that you can use the same system to subscribe to changes to make the whole code more reactive in style - in the current framework version, subscribing to input changes cannot be done without much boilerplate code ... it is not enough to only use signals in the internal component logic, you should also think about how signals can flow also through inputs and output events (I know that for output events there is no default first state) ...\r\n- Instead of investing manpower to make the hydration feature better by reusing more stuff computed by the server instead of recomputing everything on the client side, it would have been better to invest into resumability like the one introduced in Qwik (maybe the code can be ported with reasonable effort), this would be a major advantage against React and Vue\r\n- The biggest advantages of Angular are its stability, its \"batteries-included style\" (except NGRX, please merge it to an angular repo), its testability and superior separation-of-concerns architecture\r\n\r\nThanks for providing us with such a great framework, I really want Angular to be the most-used framework 👍 \r\n\r\nFine-grained reactivity is there, let's get resumability ^^\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n- signals for component inputs and outputs (events)\r\n- resumability instead of hydration\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- using another framework (not feasible since the Angular ecosystem is great)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52832","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Resumability as new SSR technique and others\"

Command\r\n\r\nbuild, serve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOur application has a plugin system where it needs to  load external modules that are **not known at build-time**. These external modules are often (but not always) Angular components, and they share dependencies with the application. Think:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Application\r\nconst { PluginComponent } = await import(\"https://cdn/plugin.js\"); // NOTE: The URL is not known at build-time\r\n\r\n\r\n// https://cdn/plugin.js\r\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\r\n@Component(/* ... */)\r\nexport PluginComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above does not work, since there is no way for `plugin.js` to resolve the `\"@angular/core\"` import.\r\n\r\nWe have solved this by making sure the plugins are SystemJS modules rather than ES Modules, and they are imported with `System.import()` with some custom resolvers (see below).\r\n\r\nHowever, we would really like to drop SystemJS and use ES modules instead. But this is not possible today.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIn order to load external modules that depend on bare specifiers, I think the cleanest solution would be to use Import Maps. A possible solution would be for Angular CLI to generate import maps for some chosen dependencies. Like:\r\n\r\nangular.json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",\r\n  \"options\": {\r\n    \"generateImportMaps\": [\r\n      \"@angular/core\",\r\n      \"@angular/common\",\r\n      \"rxjs\",\r\n      \"some-other-dependency\"\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nindex.html\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"importmap\">\r\n{\r\n  \"imports\": {\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"/chunk-foo123.js\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"/chunk-bar456.js\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, there could be a way to write & use plugins for esbuild (or vite?) that does this, if it is possible to get the generated chunk name in there.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWe are currently forcing the plugins to be built as SystemJS modules, and they are imported with `System.import`. Like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Application\r\n/* Custom SystemJS resolve & instantiate with import(\"@angular/core\") and lots of hacks */\r\nconst { PluginComponent } = await System.import(\"https://cdn/plugin.js\");\r\n\r\n\r\n// https://cdn/plugin.js\r\nSystem.register([\"@angular/core\"], function (_export, _context) {\r\n  let angularCore;\r\n  return {\r\n\t  setters: [\r\n\t\t  angularCoreDep => angularCore = angularCoreDep,\r\n\t  ],\r\n\t  execute: function () {\r\n\t\t  _export({\r\n\t\t\t  PluginComponent: /* uses angularCore.Component and more */,\r\n\t\t  });\r\n\t  }\r\n  };\r\n});\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26316","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generate import maps\" (#26316)"},{"Id":"1988061556","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-10T17:33:58","Actor":"joergbaier","Number":"26330","RawContent":null,"Title":"application builder - issues with content security policy","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn `angular.json` we use `\"subresourceIntegrity\": true` to generate a strict-dynamic CSP.\r\n\r\nOur angular application is hosted as a static website (S3 & CloudFront).\r\n\r\nThe content security policy is added via a [response headers policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/understanding-response-headers-policies.html#understanding-response-headers-policies-security).

prerendering is requested, please add some routes (including /).`.\r\n\r\nI was able to implement the workaround.

You can see that when navigating to the radio button via keyboard the tooltip is shown, but when doing the same to the checkbox, nothing is displayed.\r\n\r\nI looked over the tooltip code where the [events are being monitored](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/15.2.x/src/material/tooltip/tooltip.ts#L376-L387). This fires on the keyboard focus event for the radio, but not for the checkbox.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the second parameter of the `monitor` method is left default, which is `false`, this means that it will not check if an event was fired on a children. For radio buttons and checkboxes the event (focus) is fired on a children, on the input. So it is strange that for the radio button this works.\r\n\r\nLooking into the FocusMonitor code, I saw that on the focus event (`_onFocus`), [elementInfo](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/15.2.x/src/cdk/a11y/focus-monitor/focus-monitor.ts#L425) came with `checkChildren` on `true` for the radio, but on `false` for the checkbox. Now, on the tooltip code, all the monitors have the default value for `checkChildren` which is false.\r\n\r\nI looked after this in the radio code and saw that the `monitor` is [called with checkChildren on true](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/15.2.x/src/material/radio/radio.ts#L561). So this is why the tooltip fires on the radio.\r\n\r\nBut the tooltip did fire on the checkbox in v14 too; not anymore now in the new MDC checkbox, there is no monitor called with `checkChildren` on `true`. If you open the legacy checkbox code, you can see that it was, so that is why it worked before.\r\n\r\nSo this worked before and still works using the same mechanism for other elements (like radio, but probably others too), but seems like a strange way, since the tooltip doesn't fire because of the monitor inside the tooltip directive, but a custom monitor inside the respective components.\r\n\r\nCould the tooltip monitor all the elements using `checkChildren` on `true` or do you think it could cause issues?\r\n\r\nTested this on v15, but probably is the same for v16 and v17.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/hvjxck?file=src%2Fapp%2Fradio-overview-example.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

We include mat.core(), and we build on that. It seems that in v17, the base non-themed CSS for many (all?) components, as defined in the published .mjs files, no longer include fallback values for when the --mdc* variables are not defined. Take slider for example. Here is a rule published in 16.x as part of slider.mjs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-mdc-slider .mdc-slider__thumb-knob{border-radius:var(--mdc-slider-handle-shape, 50%); ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn v17, there is no fallback value in slider.mjs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-mdc-slider .mdc-slider__thumb-knob{border-radius:var(--mdc-slider-handle-shape); ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am guessing this change was intentional, but not having those fallback values is breaking the styling of our applications. For example, given the lack of the above fallback, the slider thumb knob is no longer rounded How can we get the default values present in 16.x to be present in 17? Is there some way to set the variables to their defaults?\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-cawym5\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

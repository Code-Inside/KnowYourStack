I thought (but didn't do) that I should paste it two times. I think it will be less confusing if the command will look like\n\n```\nng generate component [component-name] [options]\nng generate c [component-name] [options]\n```\n\nAlso there is a problem with copy button on this commands. When I click the copy button it copies with loosing some formats, so I get this:\n\n```\nng generate componentcomponent [name][options]\nng generate ccomponent [name][options]\n```\n\nSo if you don't double check the copied command it will cause the errors. I understand that it will be fixed in a couple of seconds but in my opinion it would be better to not to have these kind of mistakes\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/cli/generate\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI was looking for `ng generate` commands\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58279","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Confusing commands for generating\" (#58279)"},{"Id":"2600796508","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-20T19:46:42","Actor":"ChrisBoostwords","Number":"58278","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Deferrable Views are not working as expected when loading the deferred component in the browser network","State":"closed","Body":"**Description :**\n```\n@defer (on timer(10s)) \n{ \n  <app-box-five></app-box-five> \n}\n\n```\n\nAfter waiting 10 seconds, I checked the network tab in the browser and noticed that app.component.ts was lazy-loaded instead of box-five.component.ts.\n\nI expected that only box-five.component.ts would be lazy-loaded.\n\nCould you please explain why this behavior occurred?\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58278","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Deferrable Views are not working as expected when loading the deferred component in the browser network\" (#58278)"},{"Id":"2600276631","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-20T10:19:28","Actor":"luozt","Number":"58277","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sometimes angular router comes to be vulnerable to throw error of Cannot read properties of undefined(reading 'ɵcmp')","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nrouter\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI have been developing an app using the Angular framework for 7 years and it has a large user base. But there is a stubborn bug that often occurs, which is' Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ɵ cmp') '. This bug is usually triggered during route redirection. After triggering, the entire app can no longer redirect routes. But this problem is difficult to reproduce as there are no clear steps for reproducing it. Often, it can only be replicated on certain specific user devices. This may be related to the robustness of the angular/outer. Please arrange for research on this issue.

I'm working on a Hacker News PWA using the latest version of Angular CLI. I'm trying to make a simple GET request using HttpClient, but `ng serve` is complaining about type errors and refusing to serve my app.\n\nHere is my demo app at the line that is causing issues https://github.com/matttelliott/nghnpwa/blob/master/src/app/stories-list/stories-list.component.ts#L15 (at commit [57486f3](https://github.com/matttelliott/nghnpwa/commit/57486f34baff84025d720e8bb5e1f2b79246cb63)\n\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/http/making-requests#fetching-json-data\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nThe documentation here describes `HttpClient.get` as having an optional type argument, and if the argument is omitted the response should be typed as `any`\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/http/making-requests#fetching-json-data\n>Note the generic type argument which specifies that the data returned by the server will be of type Config. This argument is optional, and if you omit it then the returned data will have type any.\n\nWhat I'm actually seeing in my editor and from Angular CLI is that this response is typed as `Object`\n> `(property) StoriesListComponent.storyIds$: Observable<Object>`\n\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nHere is my demo app at the line that is causing issues https://github.com/matttelliott/nghnpwa/blob/master/src/app/stories-list/stories-list.component.ts#L15\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nI think in this case the documentation is correct and the HttpClient implementation has a bug. I think that if there is no explicit type argument provided to `HttpClient.get` then `any` or `unknown` are both better defaults than `Object`. In this particular case the publick Hackernews API returns a JSON response with an array of strings `string[]`, so the behavior that I'm seeing with type `Object` is not accurate in this case.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc85a6aa-228d-4fd2-8e0e-3e5c1816694c)\n\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\nI'm of course open to the possibility that I've made a mistake in my own code, but in this case I'm having a hard time finding where that might be. In this case I think the example I've provided at https://github.com/matttelliott/nghnpwa/blob/master/src/app/stories-list/stories-list.component.ts#L15 is fairly straightforward and does not match my expectations based on the documentation.\n\nI also understand the motivations for discouraging the use of `any`, but in this case I think it is appropriate. In this case I need to combine multiple HTTP requests before I get a response that I can meaningfully type, and I'd like to be able to do this without needing to explicitly type every intermediary request, especially during development. I could also understand the use of `unknown` here, but I think that `Object` is incorrect.\n\nAs a stretch goal, I think it would be nice if Angular CLI and `ng serve` provided a command line option to skip type checking at development time. I'm a huge advocate for Typescript and strong typing, largely thanks to Angular's influence on me :P, but during development and especially during prototyping, I think it would be nice to be able to treat type errors as warnings so that I can continue to build out my UI without being hindered by type errors for types that I might not yet have fully fleshed out.\n\nThanks, Angular!

An example in normalize.css:\n```\n:root {\n    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n        scroll-behavior: smooth;\n    }\n}\n``` \n\nWhen you add this to an Angular project combined with the `withInMemoryScrolling` feature enabled, users may experience a weird page transition. After navigation and the new page is renderered, the page slowly scrolls up to the top. This gets more annoying when the scroll distance gets higher.\n\nWhen a user navigates to another page, he/she expects to see the top of the new page without a scroll animation when arriving at the page. Therefor my proposal is to improve the router scroller to avoid having a smooth scroll animation during navigation.\n\nThe native [window.scrollTo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollTo) method supports a \"behavior\" option in which JS can override the behavior defined by CSS.\n\nThe changes required (imo) are:\n- Improve the @angular/common [BrowserViewPortScroller](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/src/viewport_scroller.ts) to support the native `behavior` option.\n- Change the @angular/router [RouterScroller](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/router_scroller.ts#L26) to pass the \"instant\" behavior when the user navigates to a different page.\n\nFinal remarks:\n- If navigation occurs between two states on the same page (ie. pagination), one could argue that the smooth scrolling is desirable. Not sure if this is possible, but RouterScroller should only set \"behavior: instant\" only when the new component is different than the previous component.\n- This change could be opt-in for backwards compatibility, so configuration options may be added to the inMemoryScrolling provider.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hnp8mh\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n- Scroll down the page\n- Click on \"Details\" button in any of the items in the list\n\nYou should now see the detail page appear instantly with a smooth transition scrolling to the top\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.1.2\nNode: 18.20.2\nPackage Manager: yarn 4.1.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.1.2\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1801.2\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.1.2\n@angular-devkit/core            18.1.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.1.2\n@schematics/angular             18.1.2\nng-packagr                      18.1.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI can make a PR for this, just let me know if the given proposal is acceptable...","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58258","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Odd page transition when smooth scrolling is enabled\" (#58258)"},{"Id":"2596351561","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-18T04:04:19","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"58256","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(platform-server): replace patch by CLI option.","State":"open","Body":"The CLI introduced a new option `experimentalPlatform` to disable loading a polyfill from node.

If the answer is no the angular team would be able to point to this issue for all future feature requests of this nature.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28661","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Managing large amounts of environment variables\" (#28661)"},{"Id":"2595280206","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-17T17:03:34","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28659","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): create component stylesheet bundler at start of build","State":"open","Body":"**refactor(@angular/build): move component stylesheet bundler out of compiler plugin**\r\n\r\nThe component stylesheet bundler is now created during the setup of the Angular\r\ncompiler plugin options.

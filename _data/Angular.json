Just in case it got dropped there because it is NOT a vulnerability disclosure, I am opening this issue. No intention to spam, feel free to close this issue if you have discussed this internally already and dismissed the idea.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to give your project *free* MFA hardware tokens from Google and GitHub, for use by your maintainers.  We'd especially like to give them to any of your maintainers who aren't already using any.  Our goal is to help improve the security of open source software (OSS)/Free Software projects.  For example, these tokens can counter attacks that release source code updates and/or packages using stolen passwords.\r\n\r\nBy **2021-12-20** and preferably much sooner, please let me know:\r\n\r\n1. If you want any tokens, and if so...\r\n2. How many Titan tokens from Google (up to 5)\r\n3. How many Yubikey tokens from GitHub (up to 5)\r\n4. The *private* email address to send codes to (this email must *not* go to the public, as these are use-once codes that can be used to get the tokens)\r\n5. If you could use more, how many more.\r\n\r\nWe would send you coupon codes and validation codes to the private email address.  You would then distribute those codes to the maintainers you choose.  The recipients would use the coupon codes and validation codes to \"buy\" the tokens from the Google Store and/or GitHub Shop, who would ship the tokens directly to recipients.  These codes are use-once, so make sure you can keep the codes private until they're used by the intended person.\r\n\r\n**Important**: The Google coupon codes **must be used by 2021-12-31** on the Google Store or they expire.\r\n\r\nHow can you trust us? You don't need to. You would get the MFA tokens from Google and GitHub; we're simply offering codes to make them no-cost.  We'll provide some documentation on how to use them, but you don't need to use our documents.\r\n\r\nTo qualify, each token recipient must:\r\n\r\n1. Be a maintainer or contributor to this critical open source software (OSS) project, or to another OSS project that this project depends on (the dependency may be indirect).\r\n2. Try to use an MFA token once they receive the token.  We'd like recipients to use MFA tokens from then on, but at least try.\r\n3. Not reuse the token between different people (the token must not be shared).\r\n4. Consider providing feedback to us (so we can try to fix problems).\r\n\r\nWe also need each project that receives coupon codes and/or validation codes\r\nto tell us these numbers (preferably within 30 days of getting the codes):\r\n\r\n1. How many tokens did you distribute from just Google? From just GitHub?\r\n2. How many people received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub?  From both?\r\n3. How many people didn’t have hardware tokens they used for OSS who received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub? From both?\r\n\r\nWe ask for this information so we can tell others some simple measures of success. We don't need nor want the names of any individuals participating. It's fine to ask the people who got the codes for that information and provide a best-effort summary.\r\n\r\nThe MFA tokens are shipped from the US.  They can be shipped internationally, but there are various limitations on where each can be shipped.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we can't ship somewhere if that is forbidden (sanctioned) under US law.  So at this time we are unable to ship to individuals in China, Afghanistan, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria.  Sorry about that.  See the Google and GitHub sites for more shipping information.  [More sanction information is available](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).\r\n\r\nFor more information including how-tos and other setup information can be found at the [\"Great Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Distribution Project\" site](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project).\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPlease see above.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nPlease see above.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44504","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"OpenSSF: MFA Tokens for your project\"

This works great unless you add an animation to the drawer's width after the 'mat-drawer-transition' class has been added to the drawer container. After the class has been added the animation for the drawer content lags behind the animation for the drawer width.\r\n\r\nCurrently all of the hacks and work arounds I have seen for this behavior don't take into account resizing after the drawer has been toggled open and closed. Toggling the drawer adds a class called 'mat-drawer-transition' to the drawer container in the ```_watchDrawerToggle``` method of MatDrawerContainer. This class adds the css transitions for the drawer content and backdrop and these animations seem to cause the issue. Also setting the ```autosize``` property on the drawer container does nothing in this instance.\r\n\r\nIn the sample I provided I use an inner component in the drawer to do the resizing. This encapsulates the behavior and causes the drawer itself to resize. I also use a ResizeObserver (because it is almost 2022 and we don't support IE anymore) to update the content margins continually during the width animation. I have also not used the ```autosize``` property on the drawer container because it doesn't do anything to fix the issue and the content margins are being updated during the width animation.\r\n\r\n**In my experiments removing the 'mat-drawer-transition' class after the drawer open/close animation completes fixes the issue.**\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackblitz of the issue is here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ftfajt?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the Stackblitz sample\r\n2. Toggle the size of the drawer with the arrow icon at the top of the drawer - Animation works correctly\r\n3. Toggle the drawer open and closed with the menu icon at the top of the content - Animation works correctly\r\n4. Repeat step 2 - Animation for the content left margin lags behind the animation for the drawer.\r\n\r\nTo see it working properly uncomment the code in the AppComponent openChanged method and run steps again.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe animation for the drawer should not lag behind the animation for the content.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe animation for the content lags behind the animation for the drawer when the 'mat-drawer-transition' class is present on the MatDrawerContainer.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.1.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.1.1\r\n- Browser(s): Edge (Chromium) 96.0.1054.57\r\n- Operating System: Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatDrawer): Resizing drawer after 'mat-drawer-transition' class added causes animation lag\" (#24119)"},{"Id":"1083812890","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-18T11:32:43","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"24118","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tabs): wrong scroll distance if selected tab is removed","State":"open","Body":"Fixes the case where the user has scrolled to the end of the tab list and the selected tab from the beginning is removed.

And having it included would be really nice.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, my proposal would be to expose a boolean input `matMultiSort` flag and refactor `MatSort` and `MatSortHeader` so that `MatSort` will hold the `MatSortable`'s state, and expose `isActive(id: string) => boolean` and `getNextDirection(id: string) => SortDirection` that will be used instead of directly accessing `active` and `direction`.\r\n\r\n`MatSort` will hold a `sortState: Map<string, Sort>` that can be used to query its state whenever a sort event occurs. \r\n  \r\nThis change should avoid most (if not all) compatibility issues. But it would be best if we can deprecate the current `sortChanged: EventEmitter<Sort>` for one that emits `Sort[]` instead, this way we wont need to expose `sortState` (although most of the usage examples for this API expect one to access its internal state anyway).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Known issues\r\nThis change of sorting behavior will require a review of the included sorting method for `MatTableDataSource`, that was designed around a single column sort. \r\nHaving multiple possible sortable columns will require a better strategy on sorting (weighting by index position?).\r\nOr, whenever the MatTableDataSource default implementation is used, multi-sorting could be disabled?\n\n### Use Case\n\nWe want to be able to enable sorting based on multiple columns at a time.\r\n\r\nThis should be done with minimal changes.\r\n\r\nProposed usage:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Adding matSortMultiple will enable multi-sorting -->\r\n<table mat-table matSort matSortMultiple matSortActive=\"position\" matSortDirection=\"asc\" [dataSource]=\"dataSource\">\r\n    <ng-container matColumnDef=\"name\">\r\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef mat-sort-header sortActionDescription=\"Sort by name\">\r\n      Name\r\n    </th>\r\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\"> {{element.name}} </td>\r\n  </ng-container>\r\n\r\n<ng-container matColumnDef=\"symbol\">\r\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef mat-sort-header sortActionDescription=\"Sort by symbol\">\r\n      Symbol\r\n    </th>\r\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\"> {{element.symbol}} </td>\r\n  </ng-container>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@ViewChild(MatSort) matSort: MatSort;\r\n\r\nngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    matSort.sortChanged.pipe(map(() => Array.from(matSort.sortstate.values()))\r\n    .subscribe((sorts: Sort[])=> {\r\n        // do something with the Sort[] \r\n    });\r\n}\r\n``` ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24102","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatSort): Enable multi-sorting capability on current Interface\" (#24102)"},{"Id":"1079828451","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-14T14:29:37","Actor":"NeliaRudyk","Number":"24101","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(autocomplete): Highlight the typed text in autocomplete in xCode iPhone simulator safari","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHighlight the typed text in autocomplete in xCode iPhone simulator iPhone 13 iOS 15.2 safari.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Weirdly, for some users, simply reloading a tab does not solve the issue - we have to instruct the users to manually delete a Service Worker via `chrome://serviceworker-internals`. We still didn't identify nor reproduce that scenario where reload is not working.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nProbably introduced by https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/42607, which was first released with Angular v12.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA possible solution is to check if `clientId` and `resultingClientId` are both set. If that's true, `clientId` should be used over `resultingClientId`. My crude testing showed (at least in Chrome browser) that `resultingClientId` is the client ID of a newly created web worker, and `clientId` is the client ID of a tab that spawned a web worker.\r\n\r\nSince `resultingClientId` is relevant when opening a new tab, I've tested and noticed that `clientId` is set to an empty string when opening a website in a separate tab. However, opening `window.open('/', '_top')` sets both `clientId` and `resultingClientId` - similar to a web worker scenario. Unfortunately, `location.reload()` also sets both `clientId` and `resultingClientId`, which further complicates a potential solution.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/1549afe10eddc92845cd1fde862aaa010c2395af/packages/service-worker/worker/src/driver.ts#L713-L713","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57971","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Spawning Web Worker from previous AppVersion results in network fallback\" (#57971)"},{"Id":"2549693839","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-26T07:44:04","Actor":"fantasy0v0","Number":"57967","RawContent":null,"Title":"The effect was not called when the input property changed","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am writing a component that needs to listen for changes to the input property.

Importantly, using a recent version of `istanbul-lib-instrument` and not the one that `karma-coverage` depends on.\r\n- [x] Preserve source maps so that coverage is mapped back to source files.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Notes\r\n\r\n* The additions in `packages/angular/build/src/tools/babel/plugins/*` are 1:1 copies of files already present in `packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/babel/plugins/*`. I couldn't find a clean way to prevent that. Either @angular/build have to expose the plugin in `package.json#exports` or it would have to depend on @angular-devkit/build-angular. Both seemed undesirable.\r\n* The logic for excluding files from coverage is lifted from the [equivalent webpack config](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/ecfb2b261356946d5f4a653f90c0b78db4ef519c/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/common.ts#L424-L429).

That would definitely be possible with limited effort though.\r\n\r\n### Historical Notes\r\n\r\nApproaches that _didn't_ work:\r\n\r\n- Instrument entire output chunks. `karma-coverage` really doesn't want to filter data from coverage data after the fact. Not to mention that it could be fairly expensive to send that data back to the karma process if it's then just discarded.\r\n- Implied above: Use `karma-coverage`'s built-in preprocessor. The outdated instrumentation code it's using doesn't handle async function correctly and gives bad function coverage data because of it.\r\n\r\nThings that _could've_ worked:\r\n\r\n- Apply source maps while instrumenting instead of while post-processing the coverage data. But that would've been swimming against the stream.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28509","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): karma-coverage w/ app builder\" (#28509)"},{"Id":"2552497527","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T18:49:44","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28514","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"See: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28496","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28514","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update all non-major dependencies\" (#28514)"},{"Id":"2553216682","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T15:30:47","Actor":"RGunning","Number":"28517","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: allow configuration of the vite HMR server","State":"open","Body":"Vite allows additional configuration options for the HMR server that let the user set the port, protocol and host etc. of the HMR server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguring HMR server to run on a different port to the main application fixes the issue\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, when using the `reset()` method with reactive forms, the form controls are unexpectedly marked as `touched` or `dirty`, causing **validation errors** to display immediately. This behavior is not intuitive and negatively impacts user experience, as the form appears to have errors even though no user interaction has occurred post-reset.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a stepper with multiple steps using Angular Material and reactive forms.\r\n2. Assign required validators to form controls in each step.\r\n3. Complete the stepper steps, then use the `reset()` method on the stepper to reset it.\r\n4. Observe that form controls are marked as `touched` or `dirty` even though the stepper was reset, and validation errors are displayed.\r\n5. Alternatively, you can also use the native `mat-stepper`: https://material.angular.io/components/stepper/examples#stepper-errors\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter calling `stepper.reset()`, all form controls should be reset to their initial state, marked as pristine and untouched. No validation errors should be displayed until the user interacts with the form controls again.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCalling `stepper.reset()` resets the stepper and form groups but marks all form controls as `touched` or `dirty`, triggering validation errors to display immediately.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `18.1.1`\r\n- CDK/Material: `18.1.1`\r\n- Browser(s): `Google Chrome`_(Version 127.0.6533.73 (Official Build) (arm64))_\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): `macOS(Sonoma 14.7)`, _Apple M1_\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29781","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Stepper): Stepper `reset()` Method Marks Form Controls as `Touched/Dirty`, Triggering Validation Errors\" (#29781)"},{"Id":"2540752632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T06:28:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29775","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function","State":"closed","Body":"Reworks the `youtube-player` to use the `inject` function instead of constructor-based injection.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29775","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function\" (#29775)"},{"Id":"2543298796","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:58:08","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29778","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move classes out of core","State":"open","Body":"* Moves the mat-app-background class out of core\r\n* Moves the mat-elevation-* classes out of core","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29778","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: move classes out of core\" (#29778)"},{"Id":"2543202768","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:06:03","Actor":"jacob-noble","Number":"29777","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/scrolling): virtual scroll flickers in zoneless mode.","State":"open","Body":"When `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` is enabled, virtual-scroll-viewport flickers during scroll because the transform operation becomes visible.

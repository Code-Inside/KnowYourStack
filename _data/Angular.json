However, we have encounter a big challenge when trying to integrate it with the server hydration of Web Components, specifically with Stencil.\r\n\r\nOur Angular components are predominantly composed of elements from our Stencil components library. To improve rendering and mitigate flickering of the Web Components, we've been pre-rendering them using Stencil’s `renderToString` method for server-side hydration. This approach has been effective until now but seems incompatible with Angular's non-destructive hydration. The method takes the entire generated HTML (result from Angular SSR rendering) and renders the Web Components, producing a new full HTML page, which certainly modifies the DOM and triggers the [NG0500](https://angular.io/errors/NG0500) Hydration error. \r\n\r\nWe understand that the ideal would be to avoid the DOM manipulation and for that, it would be needed to have some kind of per-component hydration method in Stencil which I think is not available at the moment, and wouldn't be too easy to implement.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that a potential resolution might involve implementing a specific hydration method in the Stencil Angular wrapper, allowing hydration via Angular's DOM renderer functions instead of direct HTML generation. However, I think this wouldn't be easy and might essentially be like implementing a full Stencil to Angular compiler rather than just a wrapper.\r\n\r\nI these solutions are not possible, we would have to skip the hydration of all the web components with `ngSkipHydration` but I think that doesn't solve the issue and by doing this, we would be losing most of the advantages of having the client hydration. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the main issues we are encountering now and preventing us of enabling the non-destructive hydration with `provideClientHydration`. \r\n\r\nWhile I understand that this might not be a direct issue with Angular and the new hydration feature, any guidance on how this might be resolved or mitigated would be very valuable. Also, I was wondering if there might be a way to facilitate collaboration with Stencil or other Web Component libraries to propose a solution. Actually, are you aware if this issue has been addressed in some way in Lit, or is there a possibility for collaboration with that team?\r\n\r\nI've created this [Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angular-ssr-ap-r3s9vc) to reproduce the problem and it would be useful for exploring potential solutions as it hosts the Stencil components in the same environment.\r\n(It should run well on first load, or it can be downloaded as well and run with `./start.sh` script. Basically, it install and build the Stencil components and the Angular wrapper, and then the Angular SSR server)\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this issue, and we look forward to any insights or suggestions you might have.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angular-ssr-ap-r3s9vc\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: NG0500: During hydration Angular expected a text node but found a comment node.\r\n\r\nAngular expected this DOM:\r\n\r\n<my-component _ngcontent-ng-c2448950787=\"\" class=\"hydrated\">\r\n  #text(Click here)  <-- AT THIS LOCATION\r\n  …\r\n</my-component>\r\n\r\nActual DOM is:\r\n\r\n<my-component _ngcontent-ng-c2448950787=\"\" class=\"hydrated\">\r\n  <!--  -->  <-- AT THIS LOCATION\r\n  …\r\n</my-component>\r\n\r\nNote: attributes are only displayed to better represent the DOM but have no effect on hydration mismatches.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem:\r\n  * check the \"AppComponent\" component for hydration-related issues\r\n  * check to see if your template has valid HTML structure\r\n  * or skip hydration by adding the `ngSkipHydration` attribute to its host node in a template\r\n\r\n Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0500\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.2.1\r\nNode: 18.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.1\r\n@nguniversal/builders           16.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for client hydration for Web Components hydrated in the server.\" (#52275)"},{"Id":"1950700294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-18T21:31:31","Actor":"Ameerw04","Number":"52274","RawContent":null,"Title":"by mistake","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This release adjusts esbuild's behavior for this edge case so that it passes while still processing aliases before `--packages=external`. Please read the linked issue for more details.\n\n-   Fix a CSS `font` property minification bug ([#&#8203;3452](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3452))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild's CSS minifier didn't insert a space between the font size and the font family in the `font` CSS shorthand property in the edge case where the original source code didn't already have a space and the leading string token was shortened to an identifier:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .foo { font: 16px\"Menlo\"; }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    .foo{font:16pxMenlo}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    .foo{font:16px Menlo}\n    ```\n\n-   Fix bundling CSS with asset names containing spaces ([#&#8203;3410](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3410))\n\n    Assets referenced via CSS `url()` tokens may cause esbuild to generate invalid output when bundling if the file name contains spaces (e.g. `url(image 2.png)`). With this release, esbuild will now quote all bundled asset references in `url()` tokens to avoid this problem. This only affects assets loaded using the `file` and `copy` loaders.\n\n-   Fix invalid CSS `url()` tokens in `@import` rules ([#&#8203;3426](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3426))\n\n    In the future, CSS `url()` tokens may contain additional stuff after the URL. This is irrelevant today as no CSS specification does this. But esbuild previously had a bug where using these tokens in an `@import` rule resulted in malformed output. This bug has been fixed.\n\n-   Fix `browser` + `false` + `type: module` in `package.json` ([#&#8203;3367](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3367))\n\n    The `browser` field in `package.json` allows you to map a file to `false` to have it be treated as an empty file when bundling for the browser. However, if `package.json` contains `\"type\": \"module\"` then all `.js` files will be considered ESM, not CommonJS. Importing a named import from an empty CommonJS file gives you undefined, but importing a named export from an empty ESM file is a build error. This release changes esbuild's interpretation of these files mapped to `false` in this situation from ESM to CommonJS to avoid generating build errors for named imports.\n\n-   Fix a bug in top-level await error reporting ([#&#8203;3400](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3400))\n\n    Using `require()` on a file that contains [top-level await](https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await) is not allowed because `require()` must return synchronously and top-level await makes that impossible. You will get a build error if you try to bundle code that does this with esbuild. This release fixes a bug in esbuild's error reporting code for complex cases of this situation involving multiple levels of imports to get to the module containing the top-level await.\n\n-   Update to Unicode 15.1.0\n\n    The character tables that determine which characters form valid JavaScript identifiers have been updated from Unicode version 15.0.0 to the newly-released Unicode version 15.1.0. I'm not putting an example in the release notes because all of the new characters will likely just show up as little squares since fonts haven't been updated yet. But you can read https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.1.0/#Summary for more information about the changes.\n\n    This upgrade was contributed by [@&#8203;JLHwung](https://togithub.com/JLHwung).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Create a schematic to add the base theme dimension","State":"open","Body":"As of v17, users need to include the new \"base\" theme dimension for the components they use. For users that are using the \"theme\" mixins now, the base dimension will be pulled in automatically. However, for users using the \"color\", \"typography\", and \"density\" mixins only, they will need to include the \"base\" mixin as well.\r\n\r\nThis schematic works by scanning all of the app's Sass to determine which components had their \"color\", \"typography\", or \"density\" mixins included, but did *not* have their \"theme\" mixin included. It then locates all of the calls to \"mat.core()\" and inserts calls to the \"base\" mixins for the identified compoennts, immediately following. It makes sense to use \"mat.core()\" as a signal for when to insert them, because the \"base\" mixins should be used once-per-app, like \"mat.core()\". We can't guarantee that a \"$theme\" will be available at the insertion point, so we create a \"$dummy-theme\" to pass to the base mixins.\r\n\r\nWe also insert a comment above the new mixins explaining why they were added and a TODO to clean up the \"$dummy-theme\".

Thank you :)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. proceed with example from the docs: https://material.angular.io/components/chips/api#MatChipRow\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDefining chip length is possible\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDefining chip length is not possible\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.0.3\r\n- @angular/cdk: 16.0.2 / @angular/material: 16.0.2:\r\n- Google Chrome:\r\n- Windows;\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27947","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(chips): impossible to define max length of mat-chip-row\" (#27947)"},{"Id":"1939749115","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-16T08:07:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27937","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/button): switch text button to tokens for color and density","State":"closed","Body":"Switches the color and density styles for the text button to tokens.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27937","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(material/button): switch text button to tokens for color and density\" (#27937)"},{"Id":"1943778923","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-15T08:06:31","Actor":"HMPerson1","Number":"27946","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(expansion-panel): `[style*=...]` attribute selector causes whole-page slowdown in Chromium","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nbefore #24045 (probably, I haven't tested it)\n\n### Description\n\n*Strictly speaking, [this is a Chromium bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1364411), but (AFAICT) the only workaround is to change the CSS in the expansion panel component.*\r\n\r\nCurrently, in Chromium-based browsers, the presence of a CSS rule selector like `.blah[style*=\"something\"] *` means that *any* change to the `style` attribute of **_any element, anywhere on the page_** will force a style recalculation of that element's entire subtree. There is currently a rule like this in `expanion-panel`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/52c85e55cd15d22abd02b4ff52b67c3752b2a27c/src/material/expansion/expansion-panel.scss#L78\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since `expanion-panel` has `ViewEncapsulation.None`, Angular won't limit the rule's scope using `[_nghost]`/`[_ngcontent]` attribute selectors, *and* Angular will copy the rule into any `ShadowDom`-encapsulated components.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/52c85e55cd15d22abd02b4ff52b67c3752b2a27c/src/material/expansion/expansion-panel.ts#L82\r\n\r\n###### *This issue was first noted [in this comment](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/c12347cafb18e900d19f613ce91afcca970d66d1#commitcomment-99447256).*\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-bsuofa?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.ts\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. Observe the animation is janky.\r\n\r\n#### Proof that `expansion-panel` is responsible:\r\n1. Delete the `<mat-expansion-panel>` element (and its children) from `example-component.html`.\r\n2. Reload (to force Angular to clear unused component styles).\r\n3. Observe the animation is now smooth.\r\n\r\n#### Proof that the `[style]` selector is responsible:\r\n1. Right-click > Inspect Element on \"expanstion panel contents\".\r\n3. In DevTools, ensure that `<div class=\"mat-expansion-panel-body\">` is selected.\r\n4. (optionally) Record a performance trace and observe that \"Recalculate Style\" affects 10,001 elements and takes a long time.\r\n5. Close the expansion panel.\r\n6. In DevTools, edit the CSS selector `.mat-expansion-panel-content[style*=\"visibility: hidden\"] *` to remove `[style*=...]`\r\n7. Observe the animation is now smooth.\r\n8. (optionally)  Record a performance trace and observe that \"Recalculate Style\" affects 1 element and is very fast.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe animation is smooth regardless of if an expansion panel exists or what the expansion panel component does internally.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe animation is smooth only after modifying an expansion-panel-internal CSS rule.\n\n### Environment\n\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.6\r\nNode: 19.9.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.6\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.8\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.6\r\n@angular/material               16.2.8\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.6\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27946","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(expansion-panel): `[style*=...]` attribute selector causes whole-page slowdown in Chromium\" (#27946)"},{"Id":"1942722694","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-13T22:26:56","Actor":"zarend","Number":"27943","RawContent":null,"Title":"snackbar testing","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27943","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"snackbar testing\" (#27943)"},{"Id":"1942107163","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-13T14:49:43","Actor":"pweyrich","Number":"27942","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(multiple): still support legacy components in v17","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27622 you've removed support for legacy components. This means, that once Angular v17 is out, one would be forced to use the mdc-based components only.\r\n\r\nWhile this might have been a reasonable choice for your team - also conforming to your update and deprecation policies - there are codebases out there (including ours) that haven't migrated to the new components yet.\r\nReasons for that are probably diverse, but one major reasons for us was the knowledge about your efforts on eventually offering a brand-new token-based theming API.\r\n\r\nWe work on a bigger enterprise grade application with a design system that's based on customized material components. Due to limited official support for customizations on the current theming API (as of v16 with legacy components) , we tend to override a lot of (global) component styles.\r\nWhile eagerly waiting for the new token-based theming API to evolve and stabilize, we hoped to have the chance to upgrade directly to this new theming API, component by component.\r\nWith the discontinued support of legacy components in v17 however, this is now impossible and our migration path to the mdc-based components is very steep (either high effort or high risk).\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nI can only see 2 options for us to move forward right now:\r\n\r\n1. While staying on v16, migrate each legacy component to the new mdc-based ones, component by component. This will require us to integrate with a new but still not latest theming API of the mdc-components first. After that migration is completed we would upgrade to v17 and have to re-integrate with the latest theming API once more, resulting in doubled theme integration effort. (high effort)\r\n2. Upgrade to v17 and migrate to mdc-based components at the same time. This would require us to migrate all components at once, which would tremendously increase the risk of the migration. However, we would only need to integrate with the latest theming API once. (high risk)\r\n\r\nIs there maybe another scenario that I am missing?\r\n\r\nIn case there's really no other option than these two, which I both consider as \"not ideal\", I would kindly ask you to re-consider still supporting legacy components in v17!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27942","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(multiple): still support legacy components in v17\" (#27942)"},{"Id":"1940540831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-12T20:53:31","Actor":"gpaimla","Number":"27940","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/button): firefox renders weird lines on certain zooms","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI don't know if this is a components issue or browser issue but for some reason, lines are being rendered on top of material buttons that have the same color as a parent divs background color for example: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/assets/14272566/a971d081-44f9-4cac-be1c-cba3b2738232\r\n\r\nTemporary fix is to set background: transparent on the parent div\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/g7dcqg?file=src%2Fexample%2Fbutton-overview-example.css\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n1.

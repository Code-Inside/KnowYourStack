With the change, they run before the component's updates and can get incorrect answers. The recent `afterRenderEffect()` API is a natural replacement for this style of effect.\r\n\r\n* `effect()`s which synchronize with the forms system are particularly timing-sensitive and might need to adjust their initialization timing.\r\n\r\nFixes #55311\r\nFixes #55808\r\nFixes #55644\r\nFixes #56863","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57874","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): change effect() execution timing & no-op `allowSignalWrites`\" (#57874)"},{"Id":"2531720088","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T21:48:12","Actor":"atscott","Number":"57859","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): Add ability to pass inputs to `TestBed.createComponent`","State":"closed","Body":"This helps mitigate #57858 by allowing testers to pass inputs that will be set _within_ the `NgZone.run` call that wraps component initialization.

I don't believe this reasoning makes any sense when it comes to directives because it's literally impossible to maintain anyway and even if it was — it's a terrible practice to rely on `<div dirA dirB>` behaving differently than `<div dirB dirA>`.\r\n\r\nConsider this situation:\r\nAll my `buttons` have a host directive that applies some visual rules — `appearance`.\r\nAll my `dropdown items` have the same host directive.\r\n\r\nNow imagine I have an element, say a `sidebar item`, that can be both a `dropdown item` and a `button` and needs some code from both of those directives. If I add both `button` and `dropdown item` to host directives of `sidebar item` I get `appearance` double matched.\r\n\r\nCollapsed sidebar shows items in dropdown:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d5898e4-02af-41df-8172-10b01ceaa6fa)\r\n\r\nExpanded sidebar shows them outside of dropdown as regular buttons:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ac3c86f-62d5-4831-98ae-dca5327b85ff)\r\n\r\nI tried to make this example as simple and transparent as possible to illustrate the issue, please do not take it at face value. In reality this cases are much more complex, but they boil down to this:\r\n\r\n**We need to be able to declare host directives freely without having to worry about combining our directives further down the line and finding out some particular combinations cause errors due to nested host directives structure.**\r\n\r\nThere's an added complexity here because host directive declarations can expose different inputs/outputs, so the real discussion here should be how to handle those best. But the core idea that it shouldn't throw for multiple matches is absolutely clear, unless I'm missing something which I'm sure I'm not but if you have a good reasoning for it — please bring it up.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nOnce a directive is already matched on an element, ignore all subsequent matches like providers do when they are seen multiple times in `providers` arrays of multiple directives on the same element.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone possible","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57846","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`hostDirectives` should auto-resolve double matching\" (#57846)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2534958857","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-19T00:00:53","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28448","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.0-next.7\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28448","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.0-next.7\" with changelog.\" (#28448)"},{"Id":"2534947304","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T23:35:34","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28447","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v18.2.5 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"18.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28447","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v18.2.5 release\" (#28447)"},{"Id":"2534932986","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T23:31:20","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28446","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.2.5\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28446","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.2.5\" with changelog.\" (#28446)"},{"Id":"2534916505","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T23:04:29","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28445","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v16.2.16 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"16.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28445","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v16.2.16 release\" (#28445)"},{"Id":"2534912943","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T22:57:08","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28444","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v16.2.16\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28444","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v16.2.16\" with changelog.\" (#28444)"},{"Id":"2534747007","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T21:14:50","Actor":"damienwebdev","Number":"28443","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow `.html` in URL in angular 18 like 'product/:slug.html' in when using @angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to use the dev-server to render my routes configured like:\r\n\r\n`/product/pixel_8.html`\r\n\r\nWhen using the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server` just as I can when using the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` builder.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI want to use my Angular application in my dev server in the exact same way as I do in my production express server. This discrepancy between my development environment and my production application is jarring, is backwards-incompatible with existing Angular behavior from 2-17, and is even against Vite's guidance about routing when doing SSR -- see: https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Use vite's connect instance as middleware. If you use your own\r\n  // express router (express.Router()), you should use router.use\r\n  // When the server restarts (for example after the user modifies\r\n  // vite.config.js), `vite.middlewares` is still going to be the same\r\n  // reference (with a new internal stack of Vite and plugin-injected\r\n  // middlewares). The following is valid even after restarts.\r\n  app.use(vite.middlewares)\r\n\r\n  app.use('*', async (req, res) => {\r\n    // serve index.html - we will tackle this next\r\n  })\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe solutions proposed by @alan-agius4 are not helpful. The first isn't a solution, it is just the problem restated. The second isn't a solution, it's a \"do this other thing instead\".\r\n\r\n> Make no changes, but be aware that refreshing the page will not work when using ng serve.\r\n> Remove .html extensions from URLs. To avoid affecting SEO, you can create a server rule that redirects .html URLs to the corresponding pages without extensions using a 301 redirect. This is the recommended long-term approach.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the commentary here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27905#issuecomment-2185785230 is widely applicable to \"non-html\" routes like `.jpg`, `.gif`, etc. Unfortunately, however, we're not talking about those, we're talking about `.html`, the **type of document that Angular is returning**.\r\n\r\n> This is expected, since the extensions matches a mime type, Including file extensions in routes is often due to legacy systems or a desire for clarity. However, this practice isn't ideal for SPAs as modern best practices favor clean, extensionless URLs. They enhance user experience, aid SEO, and ensure consistency across routes.\r\n\r\nThis is irrelevant fluff. \"Modern best practices favor clean, extensionless URLs\" is an arbitrary take on the web's current state ignoring the history of browsers as document renderers.

[`v1.79.1`](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1791)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.79.0...1.79.1)\n\n-   No user-visible changes.\n\n### [`v1.79.0`](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1790)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.78.0...1.79.0)\n\n-   **Breaking change**: Passing a number with unit `%` to the `$alpha` parameter\n    of `color.change()`, `color.adjust()`, `change-color()`, and `adjust-color()`\n    is now interpreted as a percentage, instead of ignoring the unit. For example,\n    `color.change(red, $alpha: 50%)` now returns `rgb(255 0 0 / 0.5)`.\n\n-   **Potentially breaking compatibility fix**: Sass no longer rounds RGB channels\n    to the nearest integer. This means that, for example, `rgb(0 0 1) != rgb(0 0\n    0.6)`. This matches the latest version of the CSS spec and browser behavior.\n\n-   **Potentially breaking compatibility fix**: Passing large positive or negative\n    values to `color.adjust()` can now cause a color's channels to go outside that\n    color's gamut. In most cases this will currently be clipped by the browser and\n    end up showing the same color as before, but once browsers implement gamut\n    mapping it may produce a different result.\n\n-   Add support for CSS Color Level 4 [color spaces]. Each color value now tracks\n    its color space along with the values of each channel in that color space.\n    There are two general principles to keep in mind when dealing with new color\n    spaces:\n\n    1.  With the exception of legacy color spaces (`rgb`, `hsl`, and `hwb`), colors\n        will always be emitted in the color space they were defined in unless\n        they're explicitly converted.\n\n    2.  The `color.to-space()` function is the only way to convert a color to\n        another color space. Some built-in functions may do operations in a\n        different color space, but they'll always convert back to the original space\n        afterwards.\n\n-   `rgb` colors can now have non-integer channels and channels outside the normal\n    gamut of 0-255. These colors are always emitted using the `rgb()` syntax so\n    that modern browsers that are being displayed on wide-gamut devices can\n    display the most accurate color possible.\n\n-   Add support for all the new color syntax defined in Color Level 4, including:\n\n    -   `oklab()`, `oklch()`, `lab()`, and `lch()` functions;\n    -   a top-level `hwb()` function that matches the space-separated CSS syntax;\n    -   and a `color()` function that supports the `srgb`, `srgb-linear`,\n        `display-p3`, `a98-rgb`, `prophoto-rgb`, `rec2020`, `xyz`, `xyz-d50`, and\n        `xyz-d65` color spaces.\n\n-   Add new functions for working with color spaces:\n\n    -   `color.to-space($color, $space)` converts `$color` to the given `$space`. In\n        most cases this conversion is lossless—the color may end up out-of-gamut for\n        the destination color space, but browsers will generally display it as best\n        they can regardless. However, the `hsl` and `hwb` spaces can't represent\n        out-of-gamut colors and so will be clamped.\n\n    -   `color.channel($color, $channel, $space: null)` returns the value of the\n        given `$channel` in `$color`, after converting it to `$space` if necessary.\n        It should be used instead of the old channel-specific functions such as\n        `color.red()` and `color.hue()`.\n\n    -   `color.same($color1, $color2)` returns whether two colors represent the same\n        color even across color spaces. It differs from `$color1 == $color2` because\n        `==` never consider colors in different (non-legacy) spaces as equal.\n\n    -   `color.is-in-gamut($color, $space: null)` returns whether `$color` is\n        in-gamut for its color space (or `$space` if it's passed).\n\n    -   `color.to-gamut($color, $space: null)` returns `$color` constrained to its\n        space's gamut (or to `$space`'s gamut, if passed). This is generally not\n        recommended since even older browsers will display out-of-gamut colors as\n        best they can, but it may be necessary in some cases.\n\n    -   `color.space($color)`: Returns the name of `$color`'s color space.\n\n    -   `color.is-legacy($color)`: Returns whether `$color` is in a legacy color\n        space (`rgb`, `hsl`, or `hwb`).\n\n    -   `color.is-powerless($color, $channel, $space: null)`: Returns whether the\n        given `$channel` of `$color` is powerless in `$space` (or its own color\n        space). A channel is \"powerless\" if its value doesn't affect the way the\n        color is displayed, such as hue for a color with 0 chroma.\n\n    -   `color.is-missing($color, $channel)`: Returns whether `$channel`'s value is\n        missing in `$color`. Missing channels can be explicitly specified using the\n        special value `none` and can appear automatically when `color.to-space()`\n        returns a color with a powerless channel. Missing channels are usually\n        treated as 0, except when interpolating between two colors and in\n        `color.mix()` where they're treated as the same value as the other color.\n\n-   Update existing functions to support color spaces:\n\n    -   `hsl()` and `color.hwb()` no longer forbid out-of-bounds values. Instead,\n        they follow the CSS spec by clamping them to within the allowed range.\n\n    -   `color.change()`, `color.adjust()`, and `color.scale()` now support all\n        channels of all color spaces. However, if you want to modify a channel\n        that's not in `$color`'s own color space, you have to explicitly specify the\n        space with the `$space` parameter. (For backwards-compatibility, this\n        doesn't apply to legacy channels of legacy colors—for example, you can still\n        adjust an `rgb` color's saturation without passing `$space: hsl`).\n\n    -   `color.mix()` and `color.invert()` now support the standard CSS algorithm\n        for interpolating between two colors (the same one that's used for gradients\n        and animations). To use this, pass the color space to use for interpolation\n        to the `$method` parameter. For polar color spaces like `hsl` and `oklch`,\n        this parameter also allows you to specify how hue interpolation is handled.\n\n    -   `color.complement()` now supports a `$space` parameter that indicates which\n        color space should be used to take the complement.\n\n    -   `color.grayscale()` now operates in the `oklch` space for non-legacy colors.\n\n    -   `color.ie-hex-str()` now automatically converts its color to the `rgb` space\n        and gamut-maps it so that it can continue to take colors from any color\n        space.\n\n[color spaces]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value\n\n-   The following functions are now deprecated, and uses should be replaced with\n    the new color-space-aware functions defined above:\n\n    -   The `color.red()`, `color.green()`, `color.blue()`, `color.hue()`,\n        `color.saturation()`, `color.lightness()`, `color.whiteness()`, and\n        `color.blackness()` functions, as well as their global counterparts, should\n        be replaced with calls to `color.channel()`.\n\n    -   The global `adjust-hue()`, `saturate()`, `desaturate()`, `lighten()`,\n        `darken()`, `transaprentize()`, `fade-out()`, `opacify()`, and `fade-in()`\n        functions should be replaced by `color.adjust()` or `color.scale()`.\n\n-   Add a `global-builtin` future deprecation, which can be opted-into with the\n    `--future-deprecation` flag or the `futureDeprecations` option in the JS or\n    Dart API. This emits warnings when any global built-in functions that are\n    now available in `sass:` modules are called. It will become active by default\n    in an upcoming release alongside the `@import` deprecation.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Added a `ColorSpace` class which represents the various color spaces defined\n    in the CSS spec.\n\n-   Added `SassColor.space` which returns a color's color space.\n\n-   Added `SassColor.channels` and `.channelsOrNull` which returns a list\n    of channel values, with missing channels converted to 0 or exposed as null,\n    respectively.\n\n-   Added `SassColor.isLegacy`, `.isInGamut`, `.channel()`, `.isChannelMissing()`,\n    `.isChannelPowerless()`, `.toSpace()`, `.toGamut()`, `.changeChannels()`, and\n    `.interpolate()` which do the same thing as the Sass functions of the\n    corresponding names.\n\n-   `SassColor.rgb()` now allows out-of-bounds and non-integer arguments.\n\n-   `SassColor.hsl()` and `.hwb()` now allow out-of-bounds arguments.\n\n-   Added `SassColor.hwb()`, `.srgb()`, `.srgbLinear()`, `.displayP3()`,\n    `.a98Rgb()`, `.prophotoRgb()`, `.rec2020()`, `.xyzD50()`, `.xyzD65()`,\n    `.lab()`, `.lch()`, `.oklab()`, `.oklch()`, and `.forSpace()` constructors.\n\n-   Deprecated `SassColor.red`, `.green`, `.blue`, `.hue`, `.saturation`,\n    `.lightness`, `.whiteness`, and `.blackness` in favor of\n    `SassColor.channel()`.\n\n-   Deprecated `SassColor.changeRgb()`, `.changeHsl()`, and `.changeHwb()` in\n    favor of `SassColor.changeChannels()`.\n\n-   Added `SassNumber.convertValueToUnit()` as a shorthand for\n    `SassNumber.convertValue()` with a single numerator.\n\n-   Added `InterpolationMethod` and `HueInterpolationMethod` which collectively\n    represent the method to use to interpolate two colors.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   While the legacy API has been deprecated since we released the modern API, we\n    now emit warnings when the legacy API is used to make sure users are aware\n    that it will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0. In the meantime, you can silence\n    these warnings by passing `legacy-js-api` in `silenceDeprecations` when using\n    the legacy API.\n\n-   Modify `SassColor` to accept a new `space` option, with support for all the\n    new color spaces defined in Color Level 4.\n\n-   Add `SassColor.space` which returns a color's color space.\n\n-   Add `SassColor.channels` and `.channelsOrNull` which returns a list of channel\n    values, with missing channels converted to 0 or exposed as null, respectively.\n\n-   Add `SassColor.isLegacy`, `.isInGamut()`, `.channel()`, `.isChannelMissing()`,\n    `.isChannelPowerless()`, `.toSpace()`, `.toGamut()`, `.change()`, and\n    `.interpolate()` which do the same thing as the Sass functions of the\n    corresponding names.\n\n-   Deprecate `SassColor.red`, `.green`, `.blue`, `.hue`, `.saturation`,\n    `.lightness`, `.whiteness`, and `.blackness` in favor of\n    `SassColor.channel()`.\n\n##### Embedded Sass\n\n-   Add `Color` SassScript value, with support for all the new color spaces\n    defined in Color Level 4.\n\n-   Remove `RgbColor`, `HslColor` and `HwbColor` SassScript values.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.33.0`](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5330)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.32.0...v5.33.0)\n\n-   `reduce_vars` improved when dealing with hoisted function definitions ([#&#8203;1544](https://redirect.github.com/terser/terser/issues/1544))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.4.6`](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/releases/tag/v5.4.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v5.4.5...v5.4.6)\n\nPlease refer to [CHANGELOG.md](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v5.4.6/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md) for details.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

In our angular.json file we had options set to enable vendor source maps for production and regular builds. This worked fine prior to the upgrade. Example config below for references as I cannot post details from our work setup. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"your-project-name\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"sourceMap\": {\r\n              \"scripts\": true,\r\n              \"vendor\": true\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when running ng serve with a production config the source maps for things like RX are debuggable without issue.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nng serve application --open live-reload --configuration=production\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever when we run our release jobs using this command we find the disted app does not support loading source maps from node_modules. All other source maps seem to work fine .\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build application --configuration=production\r\n```\r\n\r\nI looked for a documented change here to see if vendor source maps are still supported in production builds and couldn't find anything about them being deprecated.  \r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n404 cannot load source map\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI Version: 18.1.1\r\nNode Version: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.4\r\nOperating System: win32 x64 (Windows 64-bit)\r\n\r\n\r\n@angular-devkit/architect: 0.1801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular: 18.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core: 18.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics: 18.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular: 18.1.1\r\nng-packagr: 18.1.0\r\nrxjs: 7.8.1\r\ntypescript: 5.5.4\r\nwebpack: 5.92.1\r\nzone.js: 0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 18 production build doesn't work with vendor source maps\" (#28426)"},{"Id":"2527681186","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-16T21:01:10","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"28422","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: lock file maintenance","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n🔧 This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Use `@ViewChild(MatPaginator, { static: true }) paginator: MatPaginator;` and set paginator to dataSource on init.\r\n=> Does not work if paginator is in a conditional block (`@if` for example)\r\n2. or, Set data to dataSource after view init.\r\n=> Not great, the table will be rendered empty at first.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackblitz link: https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-overview \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

From our observations, it can start already from +/- 500 child nodes.\r\nIt does not need to be deeply nested, just 1 level deep is enough, but the amount of child nodes matters.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to reproduce it with flat `cdk-tree-node`, only when using the `cdk-nested-tree-node`. Even then, it only seems to happen when loading children dynamically plus timing (network delay) also seems to play a role. \r\n\r\nThe errors look like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d672f77-7264-4523-a140-20283e9f59ea)\r\n\r\nNOTE: it can also be reproduced using the `treeControl` instead of `childrenAccessor` (like we would write it before v18.2.0). That makes no difference.

Inspect the styles and tokens being used in developer tools.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe **--mdc-tooltip-word-break** token should be available and functional in version 18.2.3, providing consistent behavior with previous versions, for tooltip components.\r\n\r\nThis screenshot below shows the token used for word-break in Angular Material version 18.0.2\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b65fc38-d06a-4d09-a3ce-179cbaf9a410)\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe token for word-break is not available anymore and there is no way to modify the word-break property in tooltip.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot below shows the styles applied to Tooltip in Angular Material version 18.2.3\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49865007-a697-4a80-a3eb-31264ab55075)\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.3\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.3\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome Version 128.0.6613.138\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29732","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Tooltip): Missing word-break Design Token for Tooltips that was present in 18.0.2\" (#29732)"},{"Id":"2524375133","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-13T09:38:49","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29731","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(multiple): switch material to the inject function","State":"open","Body":"Switches Material from constructor-based DI to the `inject` function.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29731","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(multiple): switch material to the inject function\" (#29731)"},{"Id":"2522867286","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-13T08:34:44","Actor":"csaikiran569","Number":"29729","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(mat-select): Allow to enter custom value","State":"closed","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIs there a way to enter custom value in the mat-select .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nI have a use case to allow user to enter a custom value and also select a value from dropdown .\r\n\r\nI did spent a lot of time to find a solution for this .I apologize if this feature is available .Please do let me know if this feature is available or can be added if it is not available ?\r\n\r\nFor now as a work around I actually added an option as \"Other\" if user selects that option I was showing a input box to enter the value .\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d00bea5f-0d4e-41d1-9d98-dad71a929a8d)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29729","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(mat-select): Allow to enter custom value\" (#29729)"},{"Id":"2523468427","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-12T22:28:17","Actor":"DBowen33","Number":"29730","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tooltip): test to see switch behavior","State":"open","Body":"test to see switch behavior on mobile\r\n\r\nfixes b/286107916","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29730","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/tooltip): test to see switch behavior\" (#29730)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-09-19T03:30:03.0816623Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2236}

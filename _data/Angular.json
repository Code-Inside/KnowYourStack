In summary, this change causes the constructor for `FormControl` to be decoupled from its implementation. This will allow us to provide multiple constructor signatures in the future, and even to return `FormControl<T>` where `T` takes different values depending on the constructor signature selected.\r\n\r\nSubmitting this change separately is desirable for a few reasons:\r\n- It reduces the risk of landing Typed Forms -- the constructor override is complicated, and is fundamentally separate from the core types.\r\n- It enables us to submit a follow-up change for default values before Typed Forms lands, thus separating the only runtime behavior change from all the types-only changes.\r\n\r\nThis change should have no visible impact on users of `FormControl`.\r\n\r\nSee the Typed Forms design doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cWuBE-oo5WLtwkLFxbNTiaVQGNk8ipgbekZcKBeyxxo.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The private `_perViewChange` method was changed into a free-standing\r\n   function, to allow its name to be minimized.\r\n3.

In this case, users who try to open an Angular app with long load time in a separate window/tab to let it load in the background will potentially make no progress on the load.\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal app that shows the problem [run SimpleApp](https://angular-ivy-2selqj.stackblitz.io/) - [SimpleApp source](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-2selqj?file=src%2Fmain.ts). If you open this in a new tab, the count doesn't begin until the tab becomes visible, but if you turn off `ngZoneRunCoalescing` and open in a new tab, the count starts and continues through the end if you leave the tab hidden long enough.\r\n\r\nI am working on an app that reads data from a potentially slow external connection, then creates a bunch of components that each further process and visualize the received data, potentially creating more components. These components rely on the Angular lifecycle to receive input bindings and update several times through services, sometimes relying on the output of other components to further process the data before it can be rendered. This is all blocked until the tab becomes visible.\r\n\r\nWithout `ngZoneRunCoalescing`, users can open the app in a separate tab and allow it to load in the background while doing other work, but with this turned on, the app sits there and doesn't start loading until the tab becomes visible.\r\n\r\nI really want to use this option as I'm seeing a 10-30% improvement in load performance with it turned on (as long as the page is visible during the entire load)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-2selqj\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nApp load blocked due to all change detection stopped\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: no\r\nNode: v14.15.4\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.10\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\n\r\nAngular: 12.2.11\r\n@angular/animations: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/cdk: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/common: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/core: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/elements: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/forms: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/material: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/platform-browser: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/platform-browser-dynamic: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/platform-server: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/router: 12.2.11,\r\n@angular/upgrade: 12.2.11,\r\ntypescript: 4.3.5,\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44314","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[NgZone] Enabling Angular option ngZoneRunCoalescing causes change detection to halt when app is opened in a new tab\" (#44314)"},{"Id":"1067022734","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-30T18:47:07","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"44308","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): add migration to remove entryComponents","State":"closed","Body":"Adds an automated migration that will drop any usages of `entryComponents` from `@NgModule` and `@Component`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44308","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(core): add migration to remove entryComponents\" (#44308)"},{"Id":"1066412246","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-30T18:46:08","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"44304","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update owners for fw-benchmarks","State":"closed","Body":"Add alxhub and jelbourn to owners for fw-benchmarks group.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44304","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: update owners for fw-benchmarks\" (#44304)"},{"Id":"1066953798","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-30T17:55:13","Actor":"jeromflo","Number":"44307","RawContent":null,"Title":"Properties of class hidden for the trackby function","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nif set a properties of class with the value of acces on trackby, trackby can't acces of him properties.

Personally, I think the docs could potentially make the new learners confused.\r\n\r\nWhen I learn this part's [Milestone 5: Route guards](https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#milestone-5-route-guards). The content of the docs defines the following code:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56911263/143682510-89ede162-f096-4e3f-a370-2f984f75ecb4.png)\r\n\r\nThe `next` is highlight, but actually the highlight is meaningless, and would make the new learners confused. And below is the `canActivate` interface which comes from the docs:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface CanActivate {\r\n  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): \r\n              Observable<boolean | UrlTree> | Promise<boolean | UrlTree> | boolean | UrlTree\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd later, the docs defines the concrete method:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56911263/143682768-61269b4a-bc9e-4178-bfb6-3461a5e22e0a.png)\r\n\r\nThe `true|UrlTree` is a union type with `true` literal type. But in the above code, it is `boolean` type. I think this would also make new learners confused.\r\n\r\nAnd next the docs talks about the functionality of `canActivateChild`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56911263/143683236-a28d3120-7ca9-45cf-8140-1a3a61ffaf8b.png)\r\n\r\nIn the above code snippet, `next` becomes `route`. Actually, it can be compiled successfully and it is not the point. But I think the detail also matters especially for this wonderful framework.\r\n\n\n### What is the affected URL?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

Also if for some reason you need to make a customization for a particular build configuration your options are seemingly to either bundle a different named file as the \"index\" member in the build configuration, or replace the file in a pre-build step outside of angular-cli. Both of these options mean you must have a different index.html file somewhere that is also unlikely to be supported by tests.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIn angular.json it would be nice to define font css stylesheets; either something like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"fonts\": [\"https://use.typekit.net/abcdef.css\"],\r\n```\r\n\r\nor  perhaps simply:\r\n\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"styles\": [\"https://use.typekit.net/abcdef.css\", \"src/styles.scss\"],\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n* require an internet connection for local development with open access to font apis not being blocked\r\n* tell licensees that the font needs to be available on a number of additional dynamic urls for development purposes\r\n* give up and put a unique index.html file for each build configuration","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22259","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Offer mechanism for font inline optimization that doesn't involve putting the font in index.html\" (#22259)"},{"Id":"1067494897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-30T20:06:08","Actor":"kormide","Number":"22258","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add pkg_npm rules for remaining packages","State":"closed","Body":"Before re-writing the `build.ts` script to use bazel for building, I thought a good place to start would be to add some missing rules.

[`v0.14.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0141)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.0...v0.14.1)\n\n-   Fix `imports` in `package.json` ([#&#8203;1807](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1807))\n\n    This release contains a fix for the rarely-used [`imports` feature in `package.json` files](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) that lets a package specify a custom remapping for import paths inside that package that start with `#`. Support for `imports` was added in version 0.13.9. However, the field was being incorrectly interpreted as relative to the importing file instead of to the `package.json` file, which caused an import failure when the importing file is in a subdirectory instead of being at the top level of the package. Import paths should now be interpreted as relative to the correct directory which should fix these path resolution failures.\n\n-   Isolate implicit sibling scope lookup for `enum` and `namespace`\n\n    The previous release implemented sibling namespaces in TypeScript, which introduces a new kind of scope lookup that doesn't exist in JavaScript. Exported members inside an `enum` or `namespace` block can be implicitly referenced in a sibling `enum` or `namespace` block just by using the name without using a property reference. However, this behavior appears to only work for `enum`-to-`enum` and `namespace`-to-`namespace` interactions. Even though sibling enums and namespaces with the same name can be merged together into the same underlying object, this implicit reference behavior doesn't work for `enum`-to-`namespace` interactions and attempting to do this with a `namespace`-to-`enum` interaction [causes the TypeScript compiler itself to crash](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/46891). Here is an example of how the TypeScript compiler behaves in each case:\n\n    ```ts\n    // \"b\" is accessible\n    enum a { b = 1 }\n    enum a { c = b }\n\n    // \"e\" is accessible\n    namespace d { export let e = 1 }\n    namespace d { export let f = e }\n\n    // \"h\" is inaccessible\n    enum g { h = 1 }\n    namespace g { export let i = h }\n\n    // This causes the TypeScript compiler to crash\n    namespace j { export let k = 1 }\n    enum j { l = k }\n    ```\n\n    This release changes the implicit sibling scope lookup behavior to only work for `enum`-to-`enum` and `namespace`-to-`namespace` interactions. These implicit references no longer work with `enum`-to-`namespace` and `namespace`-to-`enum` interactions, which should more accurately match the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.\n\n-   Add semicolon insertion before TypeScript-specific definite assignment assertion modifier ([#&#8203;1810](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1810))\n\n    TypeScript lets you add a `!` after a variable declaration to bypass TypeScript's definite assignment analysis:\n\n    ```ts\n    let x!: number[];\n    initialize();\n    x.push(4);\n\n    function initialize() { x = [0, 1, 2, 3]; }\n    ```\n\n    This `!` is called a [definite assignment assertion](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-2-7/#definite-assignment-assertions) and tells TypeScript to assume that the variable has been initialized somehow. However, JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion rules should be able to insert a semicolon before it:\n\n    ```ts\n    let a\n    !function(){}()\n    ```\n\n    Previously the above code was incorrectly considered a syntax error in TypeScript. With this release, this code is now parsed correctly.\n\n-   Log output to stderr has been overhauled\n\n    This release changes the way log messages are formatted to stderr. The changes make the kind of message (e.g. error vs. warning vs. note) more obvious, and they also give more room for paragraph-style notes that can provide more detail about the message. Here's an example:\n\n    Before:\n\n         > example.tsx:14:25: warning: Comparison with -0 using the \"===\" operator will also match 0\n            14 │     case 1: return x === -0\n               ╵                          ~~\n         > example.tsx:21:23: error: Could not resolve \"path\" (use \"--platform=node\" when building for node)\n            21 │   const path = require('path')\n               ╵                        ~~~~~~\n\n    After:\n\n        ▲ [WARNING] Comparison with -0 using the \"===\" operator will also match 0\n\n            example.tsx:14:25:\n              14 │     case 1: return x === -0\n                 ╵                          ~~\n\n          Floating-point equality is defined such that 0 and -0 are equal, so \"x === -0\" returns true for\n          both 0 and -0. You need to use \"Object.is(x, -0)\" instead to test for -0.\n\n        ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"path\"\n\n            example.tsx:21:23:\n              21 │   const path = require('path')\n                 ╵                        ~~~~~~\n\n          The package \"path\" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node. Are you trying to\n          bundle for node? You can use \"--platform=node\" to do that, which will remove this error.\n\n    Note that esbuild's formatted log output is for humans, not for machines. If you need to output a stable machine-readable format, you should be using the API for that. Build and transform results have arrays called `errors` and `warnings` with objects that represent the log messages.\n\n-   Show inlined enum value names in comments\n\n    When esbuild inlines an enum, it will now put a comment next to it with the original enum name:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    const enum Foo { FOO }\n    console.log(Foo.FOO)\n\n    // Old output\n    console.log(0);\n\n    // New output\n    console.log(0 /* FOO */);\n    ```\n\n    This matches the behavior of the TypeScript compiler, and should help with debugging. These comments are not generated if minification is enabled.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v12.0.1`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1201-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1200v1201-2021-11-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v12.0.0...v12.0.1)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.44.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1440)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.43.5...1.44.0)\n\n-   Suggest `calc()` as an alternative in `/`-as-division deprecation messages.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add `SassNumber.convert()` and `SassNumber.convertValue()`.

Description\r\n\r\nSome Google fonts are rendering poorly for Windows users when automatic font inlining is turned on\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nStart up a new angular project, and add google open sans font into your `index.html` like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\r\n  <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\r\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n```\r\nSet the font-family of text to 'Open Sans' and font size to 12px.\r\nBuild the project so that the font inlining happens, and serve the static bundle locally. \r\nOne quick example to do this is to run `npx http-server dist/{PROJECT_NAME_HERE}`\r\nNotice that the rendered fonts look jagged and poor aliased.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3110057/143935224-75140edc-9af1-420a-bd88-f0e2e648a010.png)\r\n\r\nIf I turn off

([#&#8203;87](https://togithub.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters/issues/87), thanks [@&#8203;rschristian](https://togithub.com/rschristian)!)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>visionmedia/debug</summary>\n\n### [`v4.3.3`](https://togithub.com/visionmedia/debug/releases/4.3.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/visionmedia/debug/compare/4.3.2...4.3.3)\n\n### Patch Release 4.3.3\n\nThis is a documentation-only release. Further, the repository was transferred. Please see notes below.\n\n-   **Migrates repository from https://github.com/visionmedia/debug to https://github.com/debug-js/debug**. Please see notes below as to why this change was made.\n-   Updates repository maintainership information\n-   Updates the copyright (no license terms change has been made)\n-   Removes accidental epizeuxis ([#&#8203;828](https://togithub.com/visionmedia/debug/issues/828))\n-   Adds README section regarding usage in child procs ([#&#8203;850](https://togithub.com/visionmedia/debug/issues/850))\n\nThank you to [@&#8203;taylor1791](https://togithub.com/taylor1791) and [@&#8203;kristofkalocsai](https://togithub.com/kristofkalocsai) for their contributions.\n\n***\n\n### Repository Migration Information\n\nI've formatted this as a FAQ, please feel free to open an issue for any additional question and I'll add the response here.\n\n##### Q: What impact will this have on me?\n\nIn most cases, you shouldn't notice any change.\n\nThe only exception I can think of is if you pull code directly from https://github.com/visionmedia/debug, e.g. via a `\"debug\": \"visionmedia/debug\"`-type version entry in your package.json - in which case, you should *still* be fine due to the automatic redirection Github sets up, but you should also update any references as soon as possible.\n\n##### Q: What are the security implications of this change?\n\nIf you pull code directly from the old URL, you should update the URL to https://github.com/debug-js/debug as soon as possible. The old organization has *many* approved owners and thus a new repository could (in theory) be created at the old URL, circumventing Github's automatic redirect that is in place now and serving malicious code. I ([@&#8203;qix-](https://togithub.com/qix-)) also wouldn't have access to that repository, so while I don't think it would happen, it's still something to consider.\n\nEven in such a case, however, the officially released package on npm (`debug`) would *not* be affected. That package is still very much under control (even more than it used to be).\n\n##### Q: What should I do if I encounter an issue related to the migration?\n\n[Search the issues first](https://togithub.com/debug-js/debug/issues?q=label%3Amigration+) to see if someone has already reported it, and *then* open a new issue if someone has not.\n\n##### Q: Why was this done as a 'patch' release? Isn't this breaking?\n\nNo, it shouldn't be breaking. The package on npm shouldn't be affected (aside from this patch release) and any references to the old repository should automatically redirect.\n\nThus, according to all of the \"APIs\" (loosely put) involved, nothing should have broken.\n\nI understand there are a lot of edge cases so please open issues as needed so I can assist in any way necessary.\n\n##### Q: Why was the repository transferred?\n\nI'll just list them off in no particular order.\n\n-   The old organization was defunct and abandoned.\n-   I was not an owner of the old organization and thus could not ban the non-trivial amount of spam users or the few truly abusive users from the org. This hindered my ability to properly maintain this package.\n-   The `debug` ecosystem intends to grow beyond a single package, and since new packages could not be created in the old org (nor did it make sense for them to live there), a new org made the most sense - especially from a security point of view.\n-   The old org has way, *way* too many approved members with push access, for which there was nothing I could do. This presented a pretty sizable security risk given that many packages in recent years have fallen victim to backdoors and the like due to lax security access.\n\n##### Q: Was this approved?\n\n[Yes.](https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk/status/1451500306311811106)[<sup>\\[archive\\]</sup>](https://archive.fo/OQwfn)\n\n##### Q: Do I need to worry about another migration sometime in the future?\n\nNo.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild</summary>\n\n### [`v0.14.0`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0140)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.13.15...v0.14.0)\n\n**This release contains backwards-incompatible changes.** Since esbuild is before version 1.0.0, these changes have been released as a new minor version to reflect this (as [recommended by npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/)). You should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `~0.13.0`. See the documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Add support for TypeScript's `preserveValueImports` setting ([#&#8203;1525](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1525))\n\n    TypeScript 4.5, which was just released, added [a new setting called `preserveValueImports`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-5/#preserve-value-imports). This release of esbuild implements support for this new setting. However, this release also changes esbuild's behavior regarding the `importsNotUsedAsValues` setting, so this release is being considered a breaking change. Now esbuild's behavior should more accurately match the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. This is described in more detail below.\n\n    The difference in behavior is around unused imports. By default, unused import names are considered to be types and are completely removed if they are unused. If all import names are removed for a given import statement, then the whole import statement is removed too. The two `tsconfig.json` settings [`importsNotUsedAsValues`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importsNotUsedAsValues) and [`preserveValueImports`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#preserveValueImports) let you customize this. Here's what the TypeScript compiler's output looks like with these different settings enabled:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    import { unused } from \"foo\";\n\n    // Default output\n    /* (the import is completely removed) */\n\n    // Output with \"importsNotUsedAsValues\": \"preserve\"\n    import \"foo\";\n\n    // Output with \"preserveValueImports\": true\n    import { unused } from \"foo\";\n    ```\n\n    Previously, since the `preserveValueImports` setting didn't exist yet, esbuild had treated the `importsNotUsedAsValues` setting as if it were what is now the `preserveValueImports` setting instead. This was a deliberate deviation from how the TypeScript compiler behaves, but was necessary to allow esbuild to be used as a TypeScript-to-JavaScript compiler inside of certain composite languages such as Svelte and Vue. These languages append additional code after converting the TypeScript to JavaScript so unused imports may actually turn out to be used later on:\n\n    ```svelte\n    <script>\n    import { someFunc } from \"./some-module.js\";\n    </script>\n    <button on:click={someFunc}>Click me!</button>\n    ```\n\n    Previously the implementers of these languages had to use the `importsNotUsedAsValues` setting as a hack for esbuild to preserve the import statements. With this release, esbuild now follows the behavior of the TypeScript compiler so implementers will need to use the new `preserveValueImports` setting to do this instead. This is the breaking change.\n\n-   TypeScript code follows JavaScript class field semantics with `--target=esnext` ([#&#8203;1480](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1480))\n\n    TypeScript 4.3 included a subtle breaking change that wasn't mentioned in the [TypeScript 4.3 blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-3/): class fields will now be compiled with different semantics if `\"target\": \"ESNext\"` is present in `tsconfig.json`. Specifically in this case `useDefineForClassFields` will default to `true` when not specified instead of `false`. This means class field behavior in TypeScript code will now match JavaScript instead of doing something else:\n\n    ```js\n    class Base {\n      set foo(value) { console.log('set', value) }\n    }\n    class Derived extends Base {\n      foo = 123\n    }\n    new Derived()\n    ```\n\n    In TypeScript 4.2 and below, the TypeScript compiler would generate code that prints `set 123` when `tsconfig.json` contains `\"target\": \"ESNext\"` but in TypeScript 4.3 and above, the TypeScript compiler will now generate code that doesn't print anything. This is the difference between \"assign\" semantics and \"define\" semantics.\n\n    Previously you had to create a `tsconfig.json` file and specify `\"target\": \"ESNext\"` to get this behavior in esbuild. With this release, you can now also just pass `--target=esnext` to esbuild to force-enable this behavior. Note that esbuild doesn't do this by default even though the default value of `--target=` otherwise behaves like `esnext`. Since TypeScript's compiler doesn't do this behavior by default, it seems like a good idea for esbuild to not do this behavior by default either.\n\nIn addition to the breaking changes above, the following changes are also included in this release:\n\n-   Allow certain keywords as tuple type labels in TypeScript ([#&#8203;1797](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1797))\n\n    Apparently TypeScript lets you use certain keywords as tuple labels but not others. For example, `type x = [function: number]` is allowed while `type x = [class: number]` isn't. This release replicates this behavior in esbuild's TypeScript parser:\n\n    -   Allowed keywords: `false`, `function`, `import`, `new`, `null`, `this`, `true`, `typeof`, `void`\n\n    -   Forbidden keywords: `break`, `case`, `catch`, `class`, `const`, `continue`, `debugger`, `default`, `delete`, `do`, `else`, `enum`, `export`, `extends`, `finally`, `for`, `if`, `in`, `instanceof`, `return`, `super`, `switch`, `throw`, `try`, `var`, `while`, `with`\n\n-   Support sibling namespaces in TypeScript ([#&#8203;1410](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1410))\n\n    TypeScript has a feature where sibling namespaces with the same name can implicitly reference each other's exports without an explicit property access. This goes against how scope lookup works in JavaScript, so it previously didn't work with esbuild. This release adds support for this feature:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript code\n    namespace x {\n      export let y = 123\n    }\n    namespace x {\n      export let z = y\n    }\n\n    // Old JavaScript output\n    var x;\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2.y = 123;\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2.z = y;\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n\n    // New JavaScript output\n    var x;\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2.y = 123;\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2.z = x2.y;\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n    ```\n\n    Notice how the identifier `y` is now compiled to the property access `x2.y` which references the export named `y` on the namespace, instead of being left as the identifier `y` which references the global named `y`. This matches how the TypeScript compiler treats namespace objects. This new behavior also works for enums:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original TypeScript code\n    enum x {\n      y = 123\n    }\n    enum x {\n      z = y + 1\n    }\n\n    // Old JavaScript output\n    var x;\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2[x2[\"y\"] = 123] = \"y\";\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2[x2[\"z\"] = y + 1] = \"z\";\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n\n    // New JavaScript output\n    var x;\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2[x2[\"y\"] = 123] = \"y\";\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2[x2[\"z\"] = 124] = \"z\";\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n    ```\n\n    Note that this behavior does **not** work across files. Each file is still compiled independently so the namespaces in each file are still resolved independently per-file. Implicit namespace cross-references still do not work across files. Getting this to work is counter to esbuild's parallel architecture and does not fit in with esbuild's design. It also doesn't make sense with esbuild's bundling model where input files are either in ESM or CommonJS format and therefore each have their own scope.\n\n-   Change output for top-level TypeScript enums\n\n    The output format for top-level TypeScript enums has been changed to reduce code size and improve tree shaking, which means that esbuild's enum output is now somewhat different than TypeScript's enum output. The behavior of both output formats should still be equivalent though. Here's an example that shows the difference:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    enum x {\n      y = 1,\n      z = 2\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    var x;\n    (function(x2) {\n      x2[x2[\"y\"] = 1] = \"y\";\n      x2[x2[\"z\"] = 2] = \"z\";\n    })(x || (x = {}));\n\n    // New output\n    var x = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((x2) => {\n      x2[x2[\"y\"] = 1] = \"y\";\n      x2[x2[\"z\"] = 2] = \"z\";\n      return x2;\n    })(x || {});\n    ```\n\n    The function expression has been changed to an arrow expression to reduce code size and the enum initializer has been moved into the variable declaration to make it possible to be marked as `/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */` to improve tree shaking. The `/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */` annotation is now automatically added when all of the enum values are side-effect free, which means the entire enum definition can be removed as dead code if it's never referenced. Direct enum value references within the same file that have been inlined do not count as references to the enum definition so this should eliminate enums from the output in many cases:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    enum Foo { FOO = 1 }\n    enum Bar { BAR = 2 }\n    console.log(Foo, Bar.BAR)\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle --minify)\n    var n;(function(e){e[e.FOO=1]=\"FOO\"})(n||(n={}));var l;(function(e){e[e.BAR=2]=\"BAR\"})(l||(l={}));console.log(n,2);\n\n    // New output (with --bundle --minify)\n    var n=(e=>(e[e.FOO=1]=\"FOO\",e))(n||{});console.log(n,2);\n    ```\n\n    Notice how the new output is much shorter because the entire definition for `Bar` has been completely removed as dead code by esbuild's tree shaking.\n\n    The output may seem strange since it would be simpler to just have a plain object literal as an initializer. However, TypeScript's enum feature behaves similarly to TypeScript's namespace feature which means enums can merge with existing enums and/or existing namespaces (and in some cases also existing objects) if the existing definition has the same name. This new output format keeps its similarity to the original output format so that it still handles all of the various edge cases that TypeScript's enum feature supports. Initializing the enum using a plain object literal would not merge with existing definitions and would break TypeScript's enum semantics.\n\n-   Fix legal comment parsing in CSS ([#&#8203;1796](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1796))\n\n    Legal comments in CSS either start with `/*!` or contain `@preserve` or `@license` and are preserved by esbuild in the generated CSS output. This release fixes a bug where non-top-level legal comments inside a CSS file caused esbuild to skip any following legal comments even if those following comments are top-level:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .example {\n      --some-var: var(--tw-empty, /*!*/ /*!*/);\n    }\n    /*! Some legal comment */\n    body {\n      background-color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    .example{--some-var: var(--tw-empty, )}body{background-color:red}\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    .example{--some-var: var(--tw-empty, )}/*! Some legal comment */body{background-color:red}\n    ```\n\n-   Fix panic when printing invalid CSS ([#&#8203;1803](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1803))\n\n    This release fixes a panic caused by a conditional CSS `@import` rule with a URL token. Code like this caused esbuild to enter an unexpected state because the case where tokens in the import condition with associated import records wasn't handled. This case is now handled correctly:\n\n    ```css\n    @&#8203;import \"example.css\" url(foo);\n    ```\n\n-   Mark `Set` and `Map` with array arguments as pure ([#&#8203;1791](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1791))\n\n    This release introduces special behavior for references to the global `Set` and `Map` constructors that marks them as `/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */` if they are known to not have any side effects. These constructors evaluate the iterator of whatever is passed to them and the iterator could have side effects, so this is only safe if whatever is passed to them is an array, since the array iterator has no side effects.\n\n    Marking a constructor call as `/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */` means it's safe to remove if the result is unused. This is an existing feature that you can trigger by manually adding a `/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */` comment before a constructor call. The difference is that this release contains special behavior to automatically mark `Set` and `Map` as pure for you as long as it's safe to do so. As with all constructor calls that are marked `/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */`, any internal expressions which could cause side effects are still preserved even though the constructor call itself is removed:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    new Map([\n      ['a', b()],\n      [c(), new Set(['d', e()])],\n    ]);\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    new Map([[\"a\",b()],[c(),new Set([\"d\",e()])]]);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    b(),c(),e();\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>ng-packagr/ng-packagr</summary>\n\n### [`v13.0.8`](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1308-httpsgithubcomng-packagrng-packagrcomparev1307v1308-2021-11-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/compare/v13.0.7...v13.0.8)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.4`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;844)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.3...8.4.4)\n\n-   Fixed absolute path in source map on zero plugins mode.\n\n### [`v8.4.3`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;843)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.2...8.4.3)\n\n-   Fixed `this.css.replace is not a function` error.\n\n### [`v8.4.2`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;842)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.1...8.4.2)\n\n-   Fixed previous source map support in zero plugins mode.\n\n### [`v8.4.1`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;841)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.0...8.4.1)\n\n-   Fixed `Stringifier` types (by James Garbutt).\n\n### [`v8.4.0`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/releases/8.4.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.3.11...8.4.0)\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/143240813-e6fb2eff-0188-4426-8534-d9076df9fa96.jpg\" align=\"right\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"President Camio seal\">\n\nPostCSS 8.4 brought ranges for warnings and errors, smaller `node_modules` size, lazy parsing to avoid `PostCSS does nothing` warning, and TypeScript fixes.\n\n#### Thanks to Sponsors\n\nThis release was possible thanks to our community.\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\" alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"213\" height=\"50\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://themeisle.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://mllj2j8xvfl0.i.optimole.com/d0cOXWA.3970~373ad/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://s30246.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/logo.png\" alt=\"Sponsored by ThemeIsle\" width=\"171\" height=\"56\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Rages for Errors and Warnings\n\n[@&#8203;adalinesimonian](https://togithub.com/adalinesimonian), the author of amazing [Stylelint extension](https://togithub.com/stylelint/vscode-stylelint) for VS Code, added ranges to errors and warnings.\n\n```js\nresult.warn(msg, { index })           // One character warning at index\nresult.warn(msg, { endIndex })        // Starts at node start, ends at endIndex\nresult.warn(msg, { index, endIndex }) // Starts at index, ends at endIndex\nresult.warn(msg, { start })           // Starts at start, ends at node end\nresult.warn(msg, { end })             // Starts at node start, ends at end\nresult.warn(msg, { start, end })      // Starts at start, ends at end\nresult.warn(msg, { word })            // Starts at word location, ends at word index + length\n```\n\nIt will improve DX in the IDE extension.\n\n#### Lazy Parsing\n\nPreviously, we found that many tools run PostCSS even if the developer didn’t pass any PostCSS plugins. Parsing is the most expensive step in CSS processing. It led to a waste of resources without any reason.\n\nWe tried to resolve the problem by adding a `PostCSS does nothing` warning. But it didn’t force tool authors to be more careful with user’s resources.\n\nIf PostCSS sees that tool call it without passing plugins (or changing parser/stringifier), PostCSS will not parse CSS (until toll will call `Result#root`). In 8.4, [@&#8203;bogdan0083](https://togithub.com/bogdan0083) (with the help of [@&#8203;WilhelmYakunin](https://togithub.com/WilhelmYakunin)) tries to solve the problem in another way. It allows us to save resources and remove the `PostCSS does nothing` warning.\n\n```js\n// No plugins, we do not parse CSS\nlet result = await postcss().process(css, { from  })\nresult.css  // Is the same string passed to process()\nresult.map  // Special 1-to-1 source map\nresult.root // CSS will parsed only here\n```\n\n#### Install Size Reduction\n\nWith [≈60M weekly](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=postcss) downloads, PostCSS has responsibility for the world’s resource spending.\n\nTogether with [@&#8203;7rulnik](https://togithub.com/7rulnik) we [reduced](https://togithub.com/7rulnik/source-map-js/pull/7) [`source-map-js`](https://togithub.com/7rulnik/source-map-js) size. It is transitive dependency of PostCSS.\n\nIn 8.4, we moved to a fixed version of `source-map-js`, which reduced the `postcss` size in your `node_modules` from [≈1 MB to 0.3 MB](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=postcss). With the huge popularity of PostCSS, it will free a lot of resources on our CIs.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/143244369-9ec362c5-4dbd-4aff-ba9e-7b4a50a97484.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"392\" alt=\"PostCSS install size reduction\">\n#### Migration from Jest to `uvu`\n\n[@&#8203;kimoofey](https://togithub.com/kimoofey) refactored all tests from the popular Jest framework to small and fast [`uvu`](https://togithub.com/lukeed/uvu).\n\nIt will not affect end-users. However, it reduced our `node_modules` size by 33 MB and made tests twice faster (`yarn install & yarn unit`: 24 → 13 seconds).\n\n#### TypeScript Fixes\n\n-   Added `Processor` types.\n-   Added `Stringifier` types (by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j)).\n-   Fixed types `Root` and `Document` in result values (by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j)).\n-   Fixed `Node#walkRules()` types (by [@&#8203;hudochenkov](https://togithub.com/hudochenkov)).\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   Fixed docs (by [@&#8203;paulshryock](https://togithub.com/paulshryock)).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/postcss-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v6.2.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;621-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribpostcss-loadercomparev620v621-2021-11-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/compare/v6.2.0...v6.2.1)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.43.5`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1435)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.43.4...1.43.5)\n\n-   Fix a bug where calculations with different operators were incorrectly\n    considered equal.\n\n-   Properly parse attribute selectors with empty namespaces.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Print more detailed JS stack traces.

this is worth a separate issue since the other issue is not directly related to my proposal.\r\n\r\nThe current `schema.json` approach where you can define different inputs to your schematic is fine for a lot of schematics. However, there are a few that would greatly benefit from a more dynamic approach! There are other issues that requested a separate type for the JSON schema but I think this would over-complicate the current easy approach. \r\n\r\nMy proposal is to offer a TypeScript API as a target for a schematic schema.\r\n\r\n**Example collection.json**\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"schematic-with-typescript-schema\": {\r\n        \"description\": \"...\",\r\n        \"factory\": \"...\",\r\n        \"schema\": \"./some-schematic/schema#typescriptSchema\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example TS schema**\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n/**\r\n * User code\r\n */\r\ninterface MyInput {\r\n    name: string;\r\n    path: string;\r\n    needsFooter: boolean;\r\n    footerColor?: FooterColor;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype FooterColor = 'blue' | 'green' | 'red';\r\n\r\nexport function TSExampleSchema() {\r\n    return schematicsSchema<MyInput>({\r\n        name: () => createInput({\r\n            type: InputTypes.STRING,\r\n            xPrompt: \"Name of your component\"\r\n        }),\r\n        path: () => executionPath(),\r\n        needsFooter: () => createInput({\r\n            type: InputTypes.BOOLEAN,\r\n            xPrompt: \"Do you need a footer?\"\r\n        }),\r\n        footerColor: (prevValues) => prevValues.needsFooter \r\n            ? createInput({\r\n                type: InputTypes.ENUM,\r\n                enum: [\r\n                    \"blue\",\r\n                    \"green\",\r\n                    \"red\"\r\n                ],\r\n                xPrompt: \"Footer color\"\r\n            })\r\n          : noop()\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is more-or-less pseudo-code to give you an idea of what I want to achieve: an API that is more flexible but one that should not replace the simple JSON approach.\r\n\r\nOne example usage could be something like a table schematic that already knows the target data model by pre-fetching possible selections from a e.g. GraphQL Introspection before offering a list of answers\r\n\r\n```\r\nng generate my-package:table\r\n> Based on which model?\r\n   [ ] Users\r\n   [ ] Articles\r\n   [ ] Products\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA TS API to offer more advanced schematics\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nExtending the current JSON API. However, it is good as it is right now and most likely could not offer an async API without being over-complicated\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22242","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Additional TS schematics schema API\" (#22242)"},{"Id":"1064442739","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-26T18:55:47","Actor":"spock123","Number":"22236","RawContent":null,"Title":"TailwindCSS still extremely slow, and JIT not updating changes","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\nHi, I know this has been reported before, but those issues were closed due to inactivity.\r\nBut the issue still persists:\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n \r\n\r\nAdding Tailwind to Angular makes development builds extremely slow.

Angular.`\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been reported in various other places

not sure if this is an Angular or Webpack issue, I also crossposted this to webpack: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14840\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI don't have a clear reproduction, however I was able to add some logs in `emitAsset` here, which is part of the stack trace:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/14582fc41504595b04f01561ea19d27391d6b9ac/lib/Compilation.js#L4171-L4176\r\n\r\nI added:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\temitAsset(file, source, assetInfo = {}) {\r\n\t\tif (this.assets[file]) {\r\n\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\t!isSourceEqual(this.assets[file], source);\r\n\t\t\t} catch (err) {\r\n\t\t\t\tconsole.error(file, this.assets[file], source);\r\n\t\t\t\tthrow err;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output before the crash is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfontawesome-webfont.eot SizeOnlySource { _size: 165742 } RawSource {\r\n  _valueIsBuffer:

That is, they may or may not exist, base on a condition.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the following should work:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"myCondition ? subMenu : null\">{{ name }}</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current Workaround\r\nHowever, since matMenuTriggerFor cannot be null, the above code does not compile. The current solution is duplicating code with `*ngIf`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item *ngIf=\"myCondition\" [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">{{ name }}</button>\r\n<button mat-menu-item *ngIf=\"!myCondition\">{{ name }}</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why This is Needed\r\nAt first sight, it doesn't look that terrible, but as we start to add other attributes (classes, i18n suff, and other directives), and as the button content also becomes reacher (with icons and internationalized text). The code duplication is hard to maintain and can easily introduce bugs in our app.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following code:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nwith the current workaround, the code grows to:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  *ngIf=\"myCondition\" class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"subMenu\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n<button mat-menu-item  *ngIf=\"!myCondition\" class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething()>\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nwith this proposal, the code would only need to be modified slightly:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-menu-item  class=\"myclass1 myclass2\" (onClick)=\"doSomething() [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"myCondition ? subMenu : null\">\r\n      <mat-icon>check</mat-icon>\r\n      <span class=\"myClass3\"  i18n=\"@@buttonDesc\">{{ name }}</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Note**: Creating a bogus empty submenu does not work as a workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nVery often I find the need to have a menu, where their submenus are conditional.

missing.\r\nThere is a link to the material design docs which is great, but it would be awesome to have a link to the Angular Material documentation which has code examples and live demos.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it would be cool to have code examples in the JSDocs themselves.\r\nThis helps with discoverability of different ways of using components, for example showing the `mat-flat-button` as an example would be quite useful on the `mat-button` JSDoc\n\n### Use Case\n\nHaving faster access to documentation will not only help new developers who are not familiar with all the APIs that `@angular/material` has to offer, but also help refresh the memory of any developers who works in many context, such as backend work.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24024","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs(material): examples in jsdocs\"

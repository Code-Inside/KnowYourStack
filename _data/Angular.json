If needed, we could expose the entire AST\r\npath, or expose other methods to provide more context for a node.\r\n\r\nNote that due to limitations in the template AST interface, there are\r\na few known cases where microsyntax spans are not recorded properly.\r\nThis will be dealt with in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I'd like to use the 'in' operator to differentiate type.\r\nSomething like: \r\n\r\n```\r\nexport interface A {\r\n  a: number\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface B {\r\n  b: string\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport type MyUnionType = A | B;\r\n\r\nitem: MyUnionType = {\r\n    a: 1\r\n  }\r\n\r\n<div *ngIf=\"'a' in item\">\r\n  I'm expecting item is no longer of type A | B, but only A\r\n  {{item.a}}\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngifin?file=src/app/app.component.html)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38560","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support \"in\" operator in Angular templates\" (#38560)"},{"Id":"684343350","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-24T04:07:29","Actor":"dev054","Number":"38559","RawContent":null,"Title":"Better typings for router package","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n`@angular/router`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'd want propose better typing for routes.

Looks like it happens when page contains a lot of DOM elements and code tries to push them all into an array using a spread operator.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSorry, I don't know how to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/302213/90875862-6e23b200-e3aa-11ea-9b46-16de1cd13164.png)\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.5\r\nNode: 12.16.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router, upgrade\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.10\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                      9.1.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.5\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38551","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` in `@angular/animations` module in Safari\" (#38551)"},{"Id":"683197297","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-21T01:40:08","Actor":"ajitsinghkaler","Number":"38549","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: change wrong default app module by ng new","State":"open","Body":"In bootstrapping.md the default AppModule has some extra imports which are not generated\r\nby default in ng new removed those extra imports and add them at appropriate place.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The question received some upvotes but no answers to the problem, so I'm asking here because I'm really not sure what to do.\r\n\r\nThe short version is that code gated by compile-time constants like below is not being stripped in prod builds in my project, and I have no idea what to look at to figure out why. I don't know if it's a bug in Angular or a problem in my code. How can I figure out the issue? Any help that can point me in the right direction would be tremendously appreciated.\r\n\r\nI'm using this code in `main.ts` (just for testing, the actual code I need stripped is in a component):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nif (environment.production) {\r\n  console.warn('this is a prod build');\r\n  enableProdMode();\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (!environment.production) {\r\n  console.warn('this is a dev build');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this code is output as the result of the prod build:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ns.X.production&&(console.warn(\"this is a prod build\"),Object(i.R)()),s.X.production||console.warn(\"this is a dev build\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther code:\r\n\r\n<details><summary><code>environment.prod.ts</code></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n`environment.ts` is exactly the same, just with `false` instead of `true`.\r\n```ts\r\nexport const environment = {\r\n  production: true\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport * from './services/services';\r\n```\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Relevant part of <code>angular.json</code></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"my-prod-config\": {\r\n  \"optimization\": true,\r\n  \"outputHashing\": \"all\",\r\n  \"sourceMap\": false,\r\n  \"extractCss\": true,\r\n  \"namedChunks\": false,\r\n  \"aot\": true,\r\n  \"extractLicenses\": true,\r\n  \"vendorChunk\": false,\r\n  \"buildOptimizer\": true,\r\n  \"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\r\n    \"includePaths\": [\r\n      \"src/styles\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\r\n      \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.prod.ts\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"baseHref\": \"./\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary><code>tsconfig.base.json</code></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"compileOnSave\": false,\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"downlevelIteration\": true,\r\n    \"importHelpers\": true,\r\n    \"module\": \"es2020\",\r\n    \"outDir\": \"./dist/out-tsc\",\r\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n    \"declaration\": false,\r\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\",\r\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\r\n    \"allowJs\": true,\r\n    \"target\": \"es2015\",\r\n    \"lib\": [\r\n      \"es2018\",\r\n      \"dom\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"path1\": [\r\n        \"app/modules/stripped-from-stack-overflow-example1\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"path2\": [\r\n        \"app/modules/stripped-from-stack-overflow-example2\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"files\": [\r\n    \"src/main.ts\",\r\n    \"src/polyfills.ts\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"fullTemplateTypeCheck\": true,\r\n    \"strictTemplates\": true,\r\n    \"strictInjectionParameters\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary><code>package.json</code></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"my-app\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"section stripped\": \"section stripped\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@ng-idle/core\": \"9.0.0-beta.1\",\r\n    \"@ng-idle/keepalive\": \"9.0.0-beta.1\",\r\n    \"@ngneat/until-destroy\": \"8.0.1\",\r\n    \"angular-svg-icon\": \"10.0.0\",\r\n    \"brace\": \"0.11.1\",\r\n    \"caniuse-lite\": \"1.0.30001111\",\r\n    \"core-js\": \"3.6.5\",\r\n    \"css-vars-ponyfill\": \"2.3.2\",\r\n    \"detect-browser\": \"5.1.1\",\r\n    \"element-closest-polyfill\": \"1.0.2\",\r\n    \"fomantic-ui\": \"2.8.6\",\r\n    \"moment\": \"2.24.0\",\r\n    \"ngx-drag-drop\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"6.6.2\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"typeface-roboto\": \"0.0.75\",\r\n    \"uuid\": \"8.3.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.10.3\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"0.1000.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"10.0.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"10.0.8\",\r\n    \"@types/uuid\": \"8.0.1\",\r\n    \"codelyzer\": \"6.0.0\",\r\n    \"rimraf\": \"3.0.2\",\r\n    \"rxjs-tslint-rules\": \"4.34.0\",\r\n    \"ts-node\": \"8.10.2\",\r\n    \"tslint\": \"6.1.3\",\r\n    \"tslint-angular\": \"3.0.2\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"3.9.7\",\r\n    \"webpack-bundle-analyzer\": \"3.8.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI am actively trying to come up with a reproduction right now, but it's difficult because I'm just guessing at what things to try.

[Here's a screenshot of our bundle stats.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/771134/91058484-81c35880-e5f6-11ea-81be-715fa7d6ff71.png) The largest `index.ts` there has [a parsed size of 373 KB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/771134/91063473-0bc1f000-e5fc-11ea-8599-dd8ca8a0ec0e.png), but it contains nothing other than interfaces, several enums, and several const enums. They are small enums and there are only a few, the vast majority of things in this barrel are interfaces (and none of the interfaces reference classes of any kind). This exact same project using Angular 9 instead of 10 makes that barrel 20 KB instead of 373 KB.\r\n   * I think this is probably a separate issue because it's only a problem in Angular 10, whereas dev code isn't stripped in 9 or 10, but I'm mentioning it just in case.\r\n * Code bounded with `if (false) { }` is properly stripped.\r\n * Removing the services export from the end of `environment{.prod}.ts` does not fix the problem.\r\n * All CommonJS dependencies were removed, the CLI no longer complains about them, but the problem persists.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18603","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dev code not being stripped in prod builds\" (#18603)"},{"Id":"683797227","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-24T11:50:03","Actor":"clydin","Number":"18592","RawContent":null,"Title":"Partial cleanup of any type usage","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18592","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Partial cleanup of any type usage\" (#18592)"},{"Id":"684381909","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-24T05:55:39","Actor":"wellwind","Number":"18601","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wrong  parameter name of CanActivate guard.","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAccording to the document of [CanActivate](https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate) interface, the parameters of `canActivate` is\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ncanActivate(\r\n  route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, \r\n  state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<boolean | UrlTree> | Promise<boolean | UrlTree> | boolean | UrlTree\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the parameters of the generated guard file is\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ncanActivate(\r\n  next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, \r\n//~~~~\r\n//should be \"route\"\r\n  state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<boolean | UrlTree> | Promise<boolean | UrlTree> | boolean | UrlTree {\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. `ng new guard-impl-demo --defaults`\r\n2. `cd guard-impl-demo`\r\n3. `ng generate guard auth --implements CanActivate`\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.7\r\nNode: 12.13.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.7\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18601","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Wrong  parameter name of CanActivate guard.\" (#18601)"},{"Id":"684233926","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-23T18:52:41","Actor":"mfish0005","Number":"18600","RawContent":null,"Title":"Live Reload not working with WSL 2","State":"closed","Body":"#18002 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n- [x] serve\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI recently \"upgraded\" my Windows Subsystem for Linux from v1 to v2.

transpilation being the default over full project type checking like `tsc`. Type checking the full project upfront is slower but expected behaviour, so it's the default once again. You can still enable `transpileOnly` or `ts-node/register/transpile-only` for the faster transpiler without type checking.\n\n**Changed**\n\n-   Default behaviour is `typeCheck == true || transpileOnly == false`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

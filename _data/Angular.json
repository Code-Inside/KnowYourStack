This only happens when the currently selected item is changing (updated value or deleted) or if there is _no_ currently a selected value and an option value changes (either via creation or a value update). We defer the update until after rendering is complete for two reasons: first, to avoid repeatedly calling `writeValue` on every option element until we find the selected one (could be the very last element). Second, to ensure that we perform the write after the DOM elements have been created (this doesn't happen until the end of change detection when animations are enabled).\r\n\r\nThis is needed to efficiently set the select value when adding/removing options. The previous approach resulted in exponentially more `_compareValue` calls than the number of option elements (issue #41330).\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR fixes an issue with delayed element removal when using the animations module (in all browsers). Previously when a selected option was removed (so no option matched the ngModel anymore), Angular changed the select element value before actually removing the option from the DOM. Then when the option was finally removed from the DOM, the browser would change the select value to that of the first option, even though it didn't match the ngModel (issue #18430). Note that this is still somewhat of an application issue. The model value still needs to be updated to a valid value when the selected value is deleted or it will be out of sync with the DOM.\r\n\r\nFixes #41330, fixes #18430.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56459","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(forms): improve select performance and ensure that selected option matches the ngModel value\" (#56459)"},{"Id":"2353834185","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-14T18:44:59","Actor":"ChuckieHacks3-0","Number":"56457","RawContent":null,"Title":"JS Exception prevents downloading Tutorial Code","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nWhen clicking the download icon in the top right-hand corner of the editor, nothing happens.

This allows us to use the `assert` API for expressive assertions and print failures with more details.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that the test runner and the test file are actually executed as two separate processes. This means that we run `node --test` for _each_ test and print out N reports each containing exactly 1 test. This isn't ideal, but it's good enough for using assertions. We can also explore using `node --test` for the test runner just to print a single test report with all the tests listed. This might require running test code in process with the test runner.\r\n\r\n`node --test` is a little awkward in that it seems to treat all arguments as file paths to test, meaning there's no easy way to pass arguments into the tests. Since we're actually invoking our own test runner, we need to pass through the actual file being tested, but this is not easy to do with `node --test`. I feel like `node --test test_runner.js -- file_under_test.js` _should_ work, but actually doesn't. Instead, I opted to pass the file through as an environment variable. It's inelegant, but good enough for now.\r\n\r\nI also had to separate out running a _test_ from running an arbitrary process, which were previously using the same code path and conflicting with each other.\r\n\r\nExample output for a test failure: https://gist.github.com/dgp1130/e795d5d540ec98de7aac02a363f56998","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27835","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test: use Node test runner for E2E tests\" (#27835)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2355656804","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-16T10:38:58","Actor":"davidlj95","Number":"29270","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/card): remove unneeded null coalescing from example","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #29167\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29270","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(material/card): remove unneeded null coalescing from example\" (#29270)"},{"Id":"2355488241","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-16T07:01:51","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29269","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/core): simplify structural styles","State":"open","Body":"Simplifies the structural styles of `mat-option` and `mat-optgroup` to make them easier to maintain.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29269","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/core): simplify structural styles\" (#29269)"},{"Id":"2354700868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-15T09:43:13","Actor":"kfrederix","Number":"29268","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Ripple): error \"Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'FADING_IN')\"","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17.3\n\n### Description\n\nAn error is thrown for production builds when following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1.

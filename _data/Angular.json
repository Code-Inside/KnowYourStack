And the interface without Partial `{ email: string, password: string }` cannot be retrieved.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to make FormGroup read-only where validators cannot be changed. This allows control of the interface type if the FormGroup is valid.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface LoginForm {\r\n    email: FormControl<string>;\r\n    password: FormControl<string>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst login = new FormGroup<LoginForm>({\r\n    email: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),\r\n    password: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),\r\n}, { nonChangeable: true });\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can get object with type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (this.login.valid) {\r\n  const loginValidValue: { email: string, password: string } =  login.validValue;\r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the formGroup is not valid, then `validValue` may return null or a partial value.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI looked at the current issues, but did not find anything similar.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47122","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"(forms) Add a new property validValue for FormGroup<T> that will return a valid object T if the FormGroup is valid.\" (#47122)"},{"Id":"1336628117","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-12T00:44:14","Actor":"kormide","Number":"47135","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(bazel): refactor aio example e2es to fix windows performance","State":"open","Body":"@devversion @gkalpak @josephperrott @gregmagolan \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

So\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// mycomponent.spec.ts\r\nconst fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);\r\nconst component = fixture.componentInstance;\r\nconst myspy = spyOn(component, 'someFunc');\r\n\r\n// when\r\ndoSomething();\r\n\r\n// then \r\nexpect(myspy).toHaveBeenCalled(); // Success\r\nexpect(component.someValue).toBe(true); // Fail\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\n// mycomponent.ts\r\nsomeFunc = () => {\r\n  console.log('hello?');\r\n  this.someValue = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen spying on `someFunc`, the spy works for its intended purpose (seeing whether it's been called), but then immediately quits before running the code within. So any other checks, such as the second `expect` in this example, fail. Removing the spy makes the code run as expected.\r\nThe same goes for e.g. a console.log I put at the top of that function, so it's not just the actual check that somehow fails.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.0.3\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.12.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47111","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Test runner does not execute code when using spy\" (#47111)"},{"Id":"1334524954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-10T12:07:01","Actor":"CSchulz","Number":"47109","RawContent":null,"Title":"Injector.get documentation differs in implementation","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nThe injector.get documentation explains the usage of the notFoundValue and how it is handled.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/bb6e11c7e4927b0bb4da9f636bc1a2aca49c95b3/packages/core/src/di/injector.ts#L48-L53\r\n\r\nBut the implementation requires the usage of InjectorFlags.Optional\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/bb6e11c7e4927b0bb4da9f636bc1a2aca49c95b3/packages/core/src/render3/di.ts#L335-L342\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: NG0201: No provider for NgControl found in NodeInjector.

At the same time, we've been getting lots of requests for Jest in the CLI and even mocha. The different tools have their trade-offs and even though `karma` allows real browser testing it's often outperformed by `jest`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nMeet developers where they are and enable them to use the unit testing framework they want. Remove `karma` by default and instead change `ng test` to output a list of available and supported options, such as `karma` and `jest`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to `ng e2e` and `ng deploy` we can recommend solutions which have high adoption and are maintained by the owner of the testing tool to provide guarantees for higher reliability. \r\n\r\nA challenge with this approach is that it gets harder to automatically generate a unit test for every generated component/directive/component/pipe. We'd like to enable testing vendors to plug into the corresponding generator so they can provide a template that we can use in `ng generate` to produce a dummy unit test.\r\n\r\nThat's the open question as of right now, which will unblock us to provide flexibility while continuing to enforce best practices.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23734","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable developers to select a unit testing framework\" (#23734)"},{"Id":"1336518146","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T21:32:47","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23733","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: typo in cache command long description","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23733","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: typo in cache command long description\" (#23733)"},{"Id":"1336332987","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T20:01:45","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23731","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: re add `test-browsers` step","State":"closed","Body":"This was deleted by mistake","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23731","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: re add `test-browsers` step\" (#23731)"},{"Id":"1336413469","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T19:47:25","Actor":"clydin","Number":"23732","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/schematics): reduce RxJS usage in callRule/callSource functions","State":"open","Body":"The amount of additional RxJS operators and chaining has been reduced within the `callRule`\r\nand `callSource` functions.

(see the log bellow).\r\n\r\nI searched for the suspected character \"\\xe7\", and I found \"ç\" (https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+00E7).\r\nI looked for those in the project, and not iteration of it were found in the project (some in the `node_modules`).\r\n\r\nThe odd thing is: It is not working on my dev platform `OS: win32 x64`, but working on GitLab CI `OS: linux x64`\r\n\r\nI tried to update as best as possible, mostly using https://update.angular.io/ , release notes and migration guides (https://v11.angular.io/guide/updating-to-version-11 +

[`v0.15.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0151)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1)\n\n-   Update esbuild's Yarn Plug'n'Play implementation to match the latest specification changes ([#&#8203;2452](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2452), [#&#8203;2453](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2453))\n\n    This release updates esbuild's implementation of Yarn Plug'n'Play to match some changes to Yarn's specification that just landed. The changes are as follows:\n\n    -   Check for platform-specific absolute paths instead of always for the `/` prefix\n\n        The specification previously said that Yarn Plug'n'Play path resolution rules should not apply for paths that start with `/`. The intent was to avoid accidentally processing absolute paths. However, absolute paths on Windows such as `C:\\project` start with drive letters instead of with `/`. So the specification was changed to instead explicitly avoid processing absolute paths.\n\n    -   Make `$$virtual` an alias for `__virtual__`\n\n        Supporting Yarn-style path resolution requires implementing a custom Yarn-specific path traversal scheme where certain path segments are considered no-ops. Specifically any path containing segments of the form `__virtual__/<whatever>/<n>` where `<n>` is an integer must be treated as if they were `n` times the `..` operator instead (the `<whatever>` path segment is ignored). So `/path/to/project/__virtual__/xyz/2/foo.js` maps to the underlying file `/path/to/project/../../foo.js`. This scheme makes it possible for Yarn to get node (and esbuild) to load the same file multiple times (which is sometimes required for correctness) without actually duplicating the file on the file system.\n\n        However, old versions of Yarn used to use `$$virtual` instead of `__virtual__`. This was changed because `$$virtual` was error-prone due to the use of the `$` character, which can cause bugs when it's not correctly escaped within regular expressions. Now that esbuild makes `$$virtual` an alias for `__virtual__`, esbuild should now work with manifests from these old Yarn versions.\n\n    -   Ignore PnP manifests in virtual directories\n\n        The specification describes the algorithm for how to find the Plug'n'Play manifest when starting from a certain point in the file system: search through all parent directories in reverse order until the manifest is found. However, this interacts poorly with virtual paths since it can end up finding a virtual copy of the manifest instead of the original. To avoid this, esbuild now ignores manifests in virtual directories so that the search for the manifest will continue and find the original manifest in another parent directory later on.\n\n    These fixes mean that esbuild's implementation of Plug'n'Play now matches Yarn's implementation more closely, and esbuild can now correctly build more projects that use Plug'n'Play.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.10.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4100-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev493v4100-2022-08-10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.3...v4.10.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   allow to configure more `client` options via resource URL ([#&#8203;4274](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4274)) ([216e3cb](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/216e3cbe62dc90b9345995cb4f33ca9dd7b6aaba))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   response correctly when receive an OPTIONS request ([#&#8203;4185](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4185)) ([2b3b7e0](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/2b3b7e000f688e086c68ba821ed2edc3cd56a219))\n\n##### [4.9.3](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.2...v4.9.3) (2022-06-29)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   avoid creation unnecessary stream for static sockjs file ([#&#8203;4482](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4482)) ([049b153](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/049b153b87ab908ae53b71356e0716bb3fc5bf07))\n-   history-api-fallback now supports HEAD requests and handles them the same as GET ([8936082](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/8936082809a9575f231afbcad6a32bb8e14d6dce))\n\n##### [4.9.2](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.1...v4.9.2) (2022-06-06)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   add `@types/serve-static` to dependencies ([#&#8203;4468](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4468)) ([af83deb](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/af83deb199dc1d8cae4365ec2c5acf07e29358df))\n\n##### [4.9.1](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.0...v4.9.1) (2022-05-31)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   security problem with sockjs ([#&#8203;4465](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4465)) ([e765182](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/e765182e426cbca9c3c09294b02ac2d9737c1d74))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I use the \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\" with the Webpack CompressionPlugin, because i want my build files being compressed. To not have the compressed and uncompressed files in the dist directory, the 'deleteOriginalAssets' property is set to true. But the @angular-devkit/build-angular module wants to calculate the statistics and needs the deleted files. In version 9 it just returns 0 for the sizes. Now the build process breaks because in line 175 in the file @angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/plugins/analytics.js the property firstFile is undefined.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1.

You should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `~0.14.0`. See the documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Implement the Yarn Plug'n'Play module resolution algorithm ([#&#8203;154](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/154), [#&#8203;237](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/237), [#&#8203;1263](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1263), [#&#8203;2451](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2451))\n\n    [Node](https://nodejs.org/) comes with a package manager called [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which installs packages into a `node_modules` folder. Node and esbuild both come with built-in rules for resolving import paths to packages within `node_modules`, so packages installed via npm work automatically without any configuration. However, many people use an alternative package manager called [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). While Yarn can install packages using `node_modules`, it also offers a different package installation strategy called [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp/), which is often shortened to \"PnP\" (not to be confused with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which is an entirely different unrelated package manager).\n\n    Plug'n'Play installs packages as `.zip` files on your file system. The packages are never actually unzipped. Since Node doesn't know anything about Yarn's package installation strategy, this means you can no longer run your code with Node as it won't be able to find your packages. Instead, you need to run your code with Yarn, which applies patches to Node's file system APIs before running your code. These patches attempt to make zip files seem like normal directories. When running under Yarn, using Node's file system API to read `./some.zip/lib/file.js` actually automatically extracts `lib/file.js` from `./some.zip` at run-time as if it was a normal file. Other file system APIs behave similarly. However, these patches don't work with esbuild because esbuild is not written in JavaScript; it's a native binary executable that interacts with the file system directly through the operating system.\n\n    Previously the workaround for using esbuild with Plug'n'Play was to use the [`@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp) plugin with esbuild's JavaScript API. However, this wasn't great because the plugin needed to potentially intercept every single import path and file load to check whether it was a Plug'n'Play package, which has an unusually high performance cost. It also meant that certain subtleties of path resolution rules within a `.zip` file could differ slightly from the way esbuild normally works since path resolution inside `.zip` files was implemented by Yarn, not by esbuild (which is due to a limitation of esbuild's plugin API).\n\n    With this release, esbuild now contains an independent implementation of Yarn's Plug'n'Play algorithm (which is used when esbuild finds a `.pnp.js`, `.pnp.cjs`, or `.pnp.data.json` file in the directory tree). Creating additional implementations of this algorithm recently became possible because Yarn's package manifest format was recently documented: https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec/. This should mean that you can now use esbuild to bundle Plug'n'Play projects without any additional configuration (so you shouldn't need `@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp` anymore). Bundling these projects should now happen much faster as Yarn no longer even needs to be run at all. Bundling the Yarn codebase itself with esbuild before and after this change seems to demonstrate over a 10x speedup (3.4s to 0.24s). And path resolution rules within Yarn packages should now be consistent with how esbuild handles regular Node packages. For example, fields such as `module` and `browser` in `package.json` files within `.zip` files should now be respected.\n\n    Keep in mind that this is brand new code and there may be some initial issues to work through before esbuild's implementation is solid. Yarn's Plug'n'Play specification is also brand new and may need some follow-up edits to guide new implementations to match Yarn's exact behavior. If you try this out, make sure to test it before committing to using it, and let me know if anything isn't working as expected. Should you need to debug esbuild's path resolution, you may find `--log-level=verbose` helpful.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.54.4`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1544)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.54.3...1.54.4)\n\n-   Improve error messages when passing incorrect units that are also\n    out-of-bounds to various color functions.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This is related to the [23490](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23490) but however, it didnt help because deleting the node modules folder and performing npm install or yarn install still throwed issues.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n⠙ Generating browser application bundles (phase: setup)...Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, lstat 'D:/System Volume Information'\r\n    at Module.lstatSync (node:fs:1516:3)\r\n    at NodeJSFileSystem.lstat (file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-TOKOIIBI.js:342:16)\r\n    at EntryPointCollector.walkDirectoryForPackages (file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-HE5WHX7C.js:764:28)        \r\n    at file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-HE5WHX7C.js:892:70\r\n    at trackDuration (file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-HE5WHX7C.js:656:18)\r\n    at ProgramBasedEntryPointFinder.walkBasePathForPackages (file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-HE5WHX7C.js:892:25)\r\n    at ProgramBasedEntryPointFinder.findOrLoadEntryPoints (file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-HE5WHX7C.js:882:100) \r\n    at ProgramBasedEntryPointFinder.getEntryPointWithDeps (file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-HE5WHX7C.js:868:30)  \r\n    at ProgramBasedEntryPointFinder.findEntryPoints (file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-HE5WHX7C.js:826:39)        \r\n    at file:///D:/test/iMap/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/bundles/chunk-HE5WHX7C.js:1273:33\r\n✔ Browser application bundle generation complete.\r\n\r\nInitial Chunk Files   | Names         |  Raw Size\r\nstyles.css, styles.js | styles        | 535.86 kB |\r\nscripts.js            | scripts       | 388.36 kB |\r\npolyfills.js          | polyfills     | 206.71 kB |\r\nvendor.js             | vendor        | 206.08 kB |\r\nruntime.js            | runtime       |   6.52 kB |\r\nmain.js               | main          | 796 bytes |\r\n\r\n                      | Initial Total |   1.31 MB\r\n\r\nBuild at: 2022-08-09T22:28:53.706Z -

That has its pros and cons. It's great, but regardless of it, there are several issues to be solved. Especially when it comes to module development. Mainly it's about build size, traffic and performance. This issue is about collecting ideas and finding a good solution. Let be begin and explain in the following case: \r\n\r\nDeveloping an Angular app with lazy loaded modules (routing / loadChildrean) is great and using modules the way to go. But using the Angular Material components bloats the build size. Even if you don't use a shared material module. For example, if you have 10 components with it's own module, and every component uses the mat-card, mat-button or whatever. This means that the build size includes 10 times the same components. This should be avoided. But how? Avoiding modules in my app? Maybe there is a way in Angular. But Idk. Some devs create a shared module which contains all material components / modules. And importing it in every app module. In general, you'll use nearly all components of an framework in an app. This issue is about finding a way to load Material once for the whole app.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nReduce build size and traffic. Improve performance and usability. \r\n\r\n### More information\r\n\r\nYou can use the [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer)\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build --prod --stats-json && webpack-bundle-analyzer ./dist/demoapp/stats-es2015.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild a new app with routes and several modules. Lazy load routes with `loadChildren`.\r\n\r\nRelated trivia: In SCSS there are several ways to use other files. Either `@import` or `@use`. You should prefer `@use`. Because the file is only imported once. No matter how many times you use `@use` in your project. It's another point, don't be confused. This project already uses the right way. It's just a similar topic and the desired behavior of this framework in Angular at TS module level. I want to load Material only once. Having e.g. mat-card only one time in my build.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25432","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(framework): Allow loading framework once.\" (#25432)"},{"Id":"1335015725","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T09:41:01","Actor":"jacksonopp","Number":"25438","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(MatMenuHarness): MatMenuHarness.getItems() always returns 0 items","State":"closed","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\n\nUsing the `MatMenuHarness` seems to get the menu trigger, but does not seem to be able to interact with the actual menu.

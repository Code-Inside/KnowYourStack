Doing it the other way around can potentially break your tests.\". I just got bit by this due to the methods being out of order and my backend was getting called (repeatedly) during my test execution. \n\nCould we get a function that will provide all necessities without having to worry about their order?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIMO, `provideHttpClientTesting()` should be providing what `provideHttpClient()` is providing with the appropriate overrides, as I am unaware of any situation in which you would use `provideHttpClientTesting()` without `provideHttpClient()`, though I could be missing something. \n\nThe result would look like: \n```\nproviders: [provideHttpClientTesting()],\n```\ninstead of:\n```\nproviders: [provideHttpClient(), provideHttpClientTesting()],\n```\n\nWith this approach, order wouldn't need to be kept by the developer and we could remove that guidance from the docs. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe alternative would be to create a wrapper method in each project. Something like:\n```\nexport const provideHttpClientTestingWithClient = () => {\n    return [provideHttpClient(), provideHttpClientTesting()]\n}\n...\nproviders: [...provideHttpClientTestingWithClient()]\n```\n\nBut this seems like it could easily be included into Angular itself for a better developer experience.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58754","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Combine provideHttpClient() and provideHttpClientTesting() into a function that provides them in the correct order\" (#58754)"},{"Id":"2673402415","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T20:12:45","Actor":"jitterbox","Number":"58753","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular.dev update guide (v18 to v19) is missing 'ng update' command","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nThe Angular upgrade guide (v18 to v19) is missing the presumed command needed to actually upgrade Angular to v19:\n`ng update @angular/core@19 @angular/cli@19`\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/update-guide?v=18.0-19.0&l=1\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nNeed the actual upgrade command for upgrading Angular 18 to 19.\nCarrying over the same syntax from 17 to 18 worked.\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nGo to https://angular.dev/update-guide and select v18 to v19.\nAny combination of the checkboxes produces the same output with the missing `ng update` command\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nAdd the command.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57de28f-62de-4533-8d61-6793f17223ee)\n\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58753","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular.dev update guide (v18 to v19) is missing 'ng update' command\" (#58753)"},{"Id":"2673394017","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T20:07:47","Actor":"Goliworks","Number":"58752","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): control flows and types in event-dispatch","State":"open","Body":"Clean some conditions and add missing types for more readability.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [x] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However, I encountered a potential data leak issue when caching API responses. Here’s the scenario:\n\nIf I cache an API response (e.g., abc.com/api/posts) for User A, then log out and log in as User B, and switch to offline mode before fetching the API for User B, I can still see the cached data belonging to User A. This is a significant security concern, as it exposes sensitive data across user sessions.\n\nTo address this issue, I decided to implement a custom service worker to extend the functionality of Angular’s generated service worker. My custom implementation looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nimportScripts('./ngsw-worker.js');\n\nself.addEventListener('message', async (event) => {\n    const cacheNames = await self.caches.keys();\n    for (const name of cacheNames) {\n        await self.caches.delete(name);\n    }\n});\n``` \n\nWith this approach, I expect that sending a message (e.g., after logging out) will clear all cached data from the browser's cache storage:\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage({\n    type: 'CLEAR_CACHE',\n});\n``` \n\nWhile this solution successfully clears the visible data in the browser’s cache storage (verified via DevTools), an issue persists: if I refresh the page and switch to offline mode, the previously cached data is still accessible. This suggests that Angular’s ngsw-worker.js maintains an internal cache that I cannot access or clear using my current implementation.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.2.3\nNode: 20.10.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: Mac os\n\nAngular: 17.2.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.3\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.3\n@angular-devkit/core            17.2.3\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.2.3\n@angular/cli                    17.2.3\n@schematics/angular             17.2.3\nrxjs                            7.5.6\ntypescript                      5.3.3\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58733","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to Clear Cached Data in Angular-Generated Service Worker\" (#58733)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2673682686","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T22:01:53","Actor":"martin-yumsto","Number":"28898","RawContent":null,"Title":"Zoneless SSR doen't build when using file polyfill","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI'm trying to go zoneless for my SSR angular app with hydration.\n\nThis condition seems to cause difficulties to migrate to zoneless for any SSR app that uses file based polyfills: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d622e594878611c4a00aab94e15ce2dcf108b088/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/application-code-bundle.ts#L175\n\nI guess you are aware of the issue, since there is a todo on the condition that feels too generic: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d622e594878611c4a00aab94e15ce2dcf108b088/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/utils.ts#L470\n\nBasically it adds `zone.js/node` import for all the builds that have file polyfill.\n\n\nMinimal repro would be:\n\nangular.json:\n`\"polyfills\": [\"@angular/localize/init\", \"polyfills.ts\"]`\n\npolyfills.ts\n`(window as any).global = window; // Amplify`\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nngular CLI: 19.0.0\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 8.14.1\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router, service-worker, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.0\n@schematics/angular             19.0.0\nrxjs                            7.5.7\ntypescript                      5.6.3\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28898","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Zoneless SSR doen't build when using file polyfill\" (#28898)"},{"Id":"2673069910","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T18:35:56","Actor":"Gouvernathor","Number":"28896","RawContent":null,"Title":"Top-level await is not available in the configured target environment (\"chrome129.0\", \"edge129.0\", \"firefox115.0\", \"ios17.0\", \"node22.0.0\", \"safari17.0\" + 5 overrides)","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThis perfectly valid TS syntax does not work, purportedly because of browser-compatibility reasons (according to the error message), despite my project having no browser compatibility requirements.\nI have seen the closed issues about this, which are closed for comments.

  Since `cdk.high-contrast` targets a media query instead of a class, the specificity of the styles it emits is lower than before.\n-   -   The overlay stays are now loaded slightly later than before which can change their specificity. You may have to update any overlay style overrides.\n-   -   Virtual scrolling lists now have proper type checking which can reveal some previously-hidden compilation errors.\n\n    -   fix(cdk/scrolling): adds ngTemplateContextGuard\n    implements ngTemplateContextGuard for CdkVirtualForOf directive\n\n##### material\n\n-   -   The ripples styles are now loaded slightly later than before which can change their specificity. You may have to update any ripple style overrides.\n-   -   `mixinColor` and `CanColor` have been removed. Use a host binding instead.\n    -   `mixinDisableRipple` and `CanDisableRipple` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n    -   `mixinDisabled` and `CanDisable` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n    -   `mixinInitialized` and `HasInitialized` have been removed. Use a `Subject` that emits in `ngOnInit` instead.\n    -   `mixinTabIndex` and `HasTabIndex` have been removed. Use input transforms instead.\n\n##### google-maps\n\n-   -   The new [@&#8203;googlemaps/markerclusterer](https://redirect.github.com/googlemaps/markerclusterer) API should be imported instead of the old one. Read more at: https://github.com/googlemaps/js-markerclusterer\n    -   The `MapMarkerClusterer` class has been renamed to `DeprecatedMapMarkerClusterer`.\n    -   The `map-marker-clusterer` selector has been changed to `deprecated-map-marker-clusterer`.\n\n##### multiple\n\n-   -   In order for Material to be compatible with [recent changes in Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/) and upcoming changes in the CSS standard, tokens are now emitted in-place, rather the being hoisted to the top of the selector. As a result, some token overrides might not apply anymore. This is relevant primarily for the cases like `@include mat.button-theme($theme); --mat-button-color: red;`. It can be resolved by wrapping the overrides with `& {}`, for example `@include mat.button-theme($theme); & { --mat-button-color: red; }`.\n-   -   `MatButton.ripple` is no longer available.\n    -   `MatCheckbox.ripple` is no longer available.\n    -   `MatChip.ripple` is no longer available.\n\n##### material-date-fns-adapter\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

(@&#8203;angular/common)</summary>\n\n### [`v19.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1900-2024-11-19)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/18.2.12...19.0.0)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### compiler\n\n-   `this.foo` property reads no longer refer to template context variables. If you intended to read the template variable, do not use `this.`.\n\n##### core\n\n-   Angular directives, components and pipes are now standalone by default.\n    -   Specify `standalone: false` for declarations that are currently declared in `@NgModule`s.\n    -   `ng update` for v19 will take care of this automatically.\n\n-   TypeScript versions less than 5.5 are no longer supported.\n\n-   Timing changes for `effect` API (in developer preview):\n\n    -   effects which are triggered outside of change detection run as part of\n        the change detection process instead of as a microtask. Depending on the\n        specifics of application/test setup, this can result in them executing\n        earlier or later (or requiring additional test steps to trigger; see below\n        examples).\n\n    -   effects which are triggered during change detection (e.g. by input\n        signals) run *earlier*, before the component's template.\n\n-   `ExperimentalPendingTasks` has been renamed to `PendingTasks`.\n\n-   The `autoDetect` feature of `ComponentFixture` will now\n    attach the fixture to the `ApplicationRef`. As a result, errors during\n    automatic change detection of the fixture be reported to the `ErrorHandler`.\n    This change may cause custom error handlers to observe new failures that were previously unreported.\n\n-   `createComponent` will now render default fallback with empty `projectableNodes`.\n\n    -   When passing an empty array to `projectableNodes` in the `createComponent` API, the default fallback content\n        of the `ng-content` will be rendered if present. To prevent rendering the default content, pass `document.createTextNode('')` as a `projectableNode`.\n\n    ```ts\n    // The first ng-content will render the default fallback content if present\n    createComponent(MyComponent. { projectableNodes: [[], [secondNode]] });\n\n    // To prevent projecting the default fallback content:\n    createComponent(MyComponent. { projectableNodes: [[document.createTextNode('')], [secondNode]] });\n\n    ```\n\n-   Errors that are thrown during `ApplicationRef.tick`\n    will now be rethrown when using `TestBed`. These errors should be\n    resolved by ensuring the test environment is set up correctly to\n    complete change detection successfully. There are two alternatives to\n    catch the errors:\n\n    -   Instead of waiting for automatic change detection to happen, trigger\n        it synchronously and expect the error. For example, a jasmine test\n        could write `expect(() => TestBed.inject(ApplicationRef).tick()).toThrow()`\n    -   `TestBed` will reject any outstanding `ComponentFixture.whenStable` promises. A jasmine test,\n        for example, could write `expectAsync(fixture.whenStable()).toBeRejected()`.\n\n    As a last resort, you can configure errors to *not* be rethrown by\n    setting `rethrowApplicationErrors` to `false` in `TestBed.configureTestingModule`.\n\n-   The timers that are used for zone coalescing and hybrid\n    mode scheduling (which schedules an application state synchronization\n    when changes happen outside the Angular zone) will now run in the zone\n    above Angular rather than the root zone. This will mostly affect tests\n    which use `fakeAsync`: these timers will now be visible to `fakeAsync`\n    and can be affected by `tick` or `flush`.\n\n-   The deprecated `factories` property in `KeyValueDiffers` has been removed.\n\n##### elements\n\n-   as part of switching away from custom CD behavior to the\n    hybrid scheduler, timing of change detection around custom elements has\n    changed subtly. These changes make elements more efficient, but can cause\n    tests which encoded assumptions about how or when elements would be checked\n    to require updating.\n\n##### localize\n\n-   The `name` option in the ` ng add  `@localize\\`\\` schematic has been removed in favor of the `project` option.\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   The deprecated `BrowserModule.withServerTransition` method has been removed. Please use the `APP_ID` DI token to set the application id instead.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `Router.errorHandler` property has been removed.\n    Adding an error handler should be configured in either\n    `withNavigationErrorHandler` with `provideRouter` or the `errorHandler`\n    property in the extra options of `RouterModule.forRoot`. In addition,\n    the error handler cannot be used to change the return value of the\n    router navigation promise or prevent it from rejecting. Instead, if you\n    want to prevent the promise from rejecting, use `resolveNavigationPromiseOnError`.\n-   The return type of the `Resolve` interface now includes\n    `RedirectCommand`.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [24c6373820](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/24c6373820231faf9d012a2e4d7ea945d3e8513b) | feat | add optional rounded transform support in cloudinary image loader ([#&#8203;55364](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/55364)) |\n| [50f08e6c4b](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/50f08e6c4bf1caeeb08d3505ce7fabd466b9c76b) | feat | automatically use sizes auto in NgOptimizedImage ([#&#8203;57479](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/57479)) |\n| [13c13067bc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/13c13067bc3ed50cb80b0a86e62655448adb3051) | feat | disable keyvalue sorting using null compareFn ([#&#8203;57487](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/57487)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [a2e4ee0cb3](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/a2e4ee0cb3d40cadc05e28d58b06853973944456) | feat | add diagnostic for unused standalone imports ([#&#8203;57605](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/57605)) |\n| [0c9d721ac1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/0c9d721ac157662b2602cf0278ba4b79325f6882) | feat | add support for the `typeof` keyword in template expressions.

The same issue is not present with aot mode (we are unable to use aot in our application as incremental rebuilds take ~2 minutes each time). This does not appear to affect inline component `<style>` tags and only for styles added via the `styleUrl` property.\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create a new angular application with latest rc of angular 19\n2. Set `\"aot\": false` in the `angular.json`\n3. Change `src/app/app.component.html` to `<h1>Hello world!</h1>`\n4.

Integrating Angular with Deno 2.0 would provide developers with a modern, secure, and efficient runtime for building Angular applications.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n- Update the Angular CLI to support Deno 2.0 for project scaffolding, building, and serving applications.\n- Ensure that @angular/core and related packages are compatible with Deno's module system and runtime APIs.\n- Provide documentation and examples demonstrating how to develop, build, and deploy Angular applications using Deno 2.0.\n\nImplementing these changes would expand Angular's versatility and offer developers more choices in their development environments.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nBefore proposing official support for Deno 2.0 in Angular, I explored the following alternatives:\n\n1. **Manual Configuration:** Attempted to manually configure Angular projects to run on Deno by adjusting build scripts and dependencies. However, this approach proved complex and error-prone, leading to maintenance challenges.\n2. **Community Plugins:** Searched for community-developed plugins or tools that facilitate Angular's integration with Deno. While some experimental solutions exist, they lack comprehensive support and are not actively maintained.\n3. **Alternative Frameworks:** Considered using other frameworks that natively support Deno. However, this would require significant refactoring of existing Angular applications and retraining of development teams.\n\nThese alternatives highlighted the need for official support to ensure a seamless and reliable integration of Angular with Deno 2.0.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28884","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support for Deno 2.0 in Angular\" (#28884)"},{"Id":"2672736646","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T16:19:14","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28895","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.0.0 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28895","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.0.0 release\" (#28895)"},{"Id":"2672725638","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T16:14:55","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28894","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28894","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.0\" with changelog.\" (#28894)"},{"Id":"2672567961","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-19T15:32:57","Actor":"ocombe","Number":"28893","RawContent":null,"Title":"SSR returns ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH with a specific style","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nv18.x\n\n### Description\n\nA very specific style in the template of a component triggers an error `ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH` in chrome when trying to serve it with SSR.

}\n</style>\n\ncontent\n\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n```\n\nRun `npm run build` and then `npm run serve:ssr:<project name>`, go to http://localhost:4000/ in Chrome and the page doesn't load, you'll get the error `GET http://localhost:4000/ net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH 200 (OK)` in the console.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nGET http://localhost:4000/

It also throws an error if the user runs `ng add @angular/ssr --server-routing`.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of a built-in prompting mechanism in schematics beyond `x-prompt`, which can't be used here, so instead I just called Inquirer directly. Unfortunately testing the prompt is a little awkward, as Inquirier does not provide useful APIs in this space. I evaluated `@inquirer/testing`, but ultimately decided that was more intended for testing custom Inquirer prompts, not mocking usage of standard prompts. Schematics APIs do not provide a useful way to inject additional data like a mock, so instead I had to do this through a `setPrompterForTestOnly` function. I'm not a huge fan of it, but I don't see a more straightforward way of solving the problem.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28878","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): don't show server routing prompt when using `browser` builder\" (#28878)"},{"Id":"2668901869","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-18T18:06:45","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28886","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): fully disable component style HMR in JIT mode","State":"closed","Body":"The component stylesheet HMR functionality requires build-time analysis of each component by the AOT compiler to provide the needed information to identify initial styles and detect individual changes to each style.

Basically, `readResource` returning a string and not a Promise was triggering what I suspect was unintended behavior:\r\n\r\n1. In [`AdapterResourceLoader.preload`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/92f30a749d676a290f5e173760ca29f0ff85ba8c/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/resource/src/loader.ts#L82), a string result from `readResource` leads to the function returning `undefined` instead of `Promise<undefined>`.\r\n2. In [`preloadAndParseTemplate`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/92f30a749d676a290f5e173760ca29f0ff85ba8c/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/annotations/component/src/resources.ts#L403), an `undefined` return value of `preload` results in an immediate `return Promise.resolve(null)` while a `Promise.resolve(undefined)` actually populates the template cache and returns the `template` value.\r\n3. Without a `template` value, the [`ComponentDecoratorHandler.preanalyze`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/annotations/component/src/handler.ts#L374-L376) method will always return `templateStyles: []` - completely ignoring what might have actually been in the template. Which is kind of fair - it never got to see the value of `template`.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the lines, something disagrees about the meaning of `undefined` and/or if there is a semantic difference between `undefined` and `Promise<undefined>`. I'm pretty sure what we want here is the behavior of `Promise<undefined>` where it actually takes the template metadata.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28873","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): bring back style tags in browser builder\" (#28873)"},{"Id":"2664261629","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-16T12:20:29","Actor":"arturo32","Number":"28882","RawContent":null,"Title":"Duplication of local fonts files imported in SCSS (reopen of #6599)","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n[reopen of #6599]\n\n\n# The problem\nTwo copies of the same font are appearing in the dist directory after `ng build`: One, located in the the `assets/fonts folder`, other in the root of `dist` (actually, as this projects is using i18n, at the root of each language folder):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac1a665-cc77-4777-8012-f3aee2be6027)\n\nThe one at the \"root\" have a random string attached before the .woff2. Generated by a post-processor of CSS for what I understand. The bundled CSS in the `dist` folder references it.\n\nBesides the **increase in size of the build output**, one thing that is not working is **preloading fonts** in the `src/index.html` file. Using `href=\"assets/fonts/font.woff2\"` in a `<link rel=\"preload\">` tag will make the browser download this font, not use it, and download the version imported in the bundled CSS file in the root of `dist`.\n\n# Expected behavior\nI expected the bundled CSS to reference the font file inside the assets folder, not it to create another font in the root of the output files. Is there a configuration in `angular.json` that may prevent this behavior? Do I have to create a webpack configuration file?\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Have a font inside `src/assets/fonts/font.woff2`;\n2. Import it in a `@font-face` in the format `src: url('assets/fonts/font.woff2')` in the `src/styles.scss` file;  \n3. Build the project using `ng build` command;\n\nMy settings is closer to [@ziemerz in #6599](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/6599#issuecomment-336446594) as I am also using i18n. So changing `src: url('assets/fonts/font.woff2')`  to an absolute path like `src: url('/assets/fonts/font.woff2')` will not work for me.\n\nReproduction repository:

While we can refactor our code to only rely on the `default` property, the problem becomes more difficult as it's only reproducible when disabling dependency pre-bundling (i.e. building for production), so our team are not even aware there is a problem during local development and will only find the issue after deployment, which is a bit of a footgun. Ideally behaviour during both development and in production builds would be the same.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```\ngh repo clone mattlewis92/ng-cli-code-splitting-bug\ncd ng-cli-code-splitting-bug\nnpm i\nng serve webpack # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module contains all commonjs exports on the top level object\nng serve esbuild-with-pre-bundle # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module contains all commonjs exports on the top level object\nng serve esbuild-no-pre-bundle # Observe browser console of the dynamically imported module only contains a `default` export\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 18.2.12\nNode: 20.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.12\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.12\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.12\n@schematics/angular             18.2.12\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28869","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Differences in output when dynamically importing commonjs in local dev and production mode\" (#28869)"},{"Id":"2663383397","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T15:10:23","Actor":"jopelle1","Number":"28874","RawContent":null,"Title":"Spread operator slow with `application` builder","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nHello,\nI noticed that the spread operator is significantly slower (sometimes more than 2x slower) when using vite instead of webpack.\nThis doubles the loading time of some of our components.\n\nIn my [minimal reproduction](https://github.com/jopelle1/repro-angular-vite), I get an average of 10ms with webpack and 35ms with vite, with both firefox and chrome.\n\nIs this indeed an issue with angular and is there any way to fix it?\n\nThank you \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/jopelle1/repro-angular-vite\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.3.11\nNode: 18.20.4\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 17.3.12\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.11\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.11\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.11\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.11\n@angular/cli                    17.3.11\n@schematics/angular             17.3.11\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.4.5\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28874","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Spread operator slow with `application` builder\" (#28874)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2674219860","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-20T03:29:23","Actor":"danielalexis","Number":"30049","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Button): Ripple color is not automatically calculated","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using mat.button-overrides() when changing the filled-ripple-color property the ripple becames the full color instead of having an opacity of 12%\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-heyt9c\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

is considered part of the accordion item's name. (This also makes it [invalid to put interactive elements inside the accordion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role#all_descendants_are_presentational).)\n- The accordion items are focusable, but there's no way to open/close them using the keyboard.\n\nThe code should probably look more like the [WAI-ARIA accordion example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion/), where the _header_ (not the entire accordion item) is a `<button>` that gets the `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes.

The current example uses the &lt;table&gt; tag, but it should be using &lt;mat-table&gt; instead. This discrepancy may cause confusion for new developers who rely on the documentation for accurate guidance.\n\nProblem Details:\nOn the [Angular Material mat-table documentation page](https://v13.material.angular.io/components/table/overview), the code examples use the standard '&lt;table&gt;' tag, which does not support Angular Material's dataSource binding. New developers might encounter errors like \"Can't bind to 'dataSource' since it isn't a known property of 'table'\" if they follow the provided example as-is.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe documentation should demonstrate the proper usage of &lt;mat-table&gt; instead of &lt;table&gt;. Updating the examples to reflect the correct component will make the documentation more accurate and prevent confusion for developers.\n\nSuggestion:\nReplace instances of &lt;table&gt; with &lt;mat-table&gt; in the code examples, ensuring that all Angular Material features, like dataSource binding, are correctly showcased. This will provide developers with working examples that do not require additional troubleshooting.\n\nAdditional Context:\nMany developers are finding the correct solution only after searching online, as seen in this [Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50228138/cant-bind-to-datasource-since-it-isnt-a-known-property-of-table). It would be beneficial to keep the documentation up to date with working code examples to help new developers avoid unnecessary confusion.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://v13.material.angular.io/components/table/examples","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30031","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): Issue with Angular Material Documentation: Incorrect mat-table Example\" (#30031)"},{"Id":"2662577144","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T16:55:20","Actor":"DBowen33","Number":"30029","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): update documentation","State":"open","Body":"update documentation to let users know about passing 3:1 non text contrast ratio for active and inactive slider tracks\r\n\r\nfixes b/286300099","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30029","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): update documentation\" (#30029)"},{"Id":"2662035329","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T13:48:16","Actor":"XLeapZan","Number":"30028","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(CDK Dialog): aria-hidden is not removed when a child dialog is opened before but closed after a parent dialog.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen an application uses routing, the application has its CDK `Dialog` instance (A), and the route's component has its own CDK `Dialog` instance (B), which has A as its parent.\n\nWhen B opens a component in an overlay, it sets the **aria-hidden** attributes.\n\nWhen the application provides a set of shared dialog components and a service to open them, they are opened from A, and **aria-hidden** attributes are not set because they are already present.

According to the Angular documentation, interceptors are run in the injection context of the injector which registered them and can use Angular's inject API to retrieve dependencies. However, when I attempt to use the inject function, it throws the following error:\r\n`Error: NG0203: inject() must be called from an injection context such as a constructor, a factory function, a field initializer, or a function used with `runInInjectionContext`.`\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:** \r\n\r\n1. Create an HttpInterceptorFn as shown below:\r\n```typescript \r\nexport const authInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (\r\n  req,\r\n  next,\r\n): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> =>\r\n  next(req).pipe(\r\n    tap({\r\n      error: (err: any) => {\r\n        if (err instanceof HttpErrorResponse) {\r\n          if (err.status === 401) {\r\n            navigateOut();\r\n          }\r\n          inject(ErrorHandler).handleError(err);\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n    }),\r\n  );\r\n ```\r\n2. Add this to appconfig`provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authInterceptor]))`\r\n3. Run the application and trigger an HTTP request that results in an error.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:** The inject function should be able to retrieve the ErrorHandler dependency without throwing an error.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:** The inject function throws an error indicating it must be called from an injection context.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:** \r\nAngular version: 18.0.5\r\nnx version: 19.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nError: NG0203: inject() must be called from an injection context such as a constructor, a factory function, a field initializer, or a function used with `runInInjectionContext`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular version: 18.0.5\r\nNx version: 19.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56916","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`inject` function throws error when used in `HttpInterceptorFn`\" (#56916)"},{"Id":"2398872240","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-09T18:26:36","Actor":"marcospds","Number":"56915","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update compat table with 13.4.x","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The component has `disabled` input which can set by three ways: 1. HTML-standard style `<app-checkbox disabled>`, 2. Simple property-binding `<app-checkbox [disabled]=\"true\">` and 3. via form control `disable()` method.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [AppCheckbox, ReactiveFormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-checkbox disabled />\r\n    <app-checkbox [disabled]=\"true\" />\r\n    <app-checkbox [formControl]=\"formControl\" />\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App {\r\n  formControl = new FormControl(false);\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    this.formControl.disable();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuite simply, that functionality cannot be achieved with Signal APIs at the same time. \r\n\r\nWith `input()` function, the `disabled` property becomes a read-only signal within the component. So `setDisabledState()` cannot set a value from the form control. \r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-checkbox',\r\n})\r\nexport class AppCheckbox {\r\n  disabled = input(false, { transform: booleanAttribute });\r\n\r\n  setDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean) {\r\n    this.disabled.set(isDisabled); // <--- input() is read-only\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with `model()` function cannot take the `transform` option. So `<app-checkbox disabled>` doesn't work.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-checkbox',\r\n})\r\nexport class AppCheckbox {\r\n  disabled = model(false, { transform: booleanAttribute }); // <-- model doesn't have `transform`\r\n\r\n  setDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean) {\r\n    this.disabled.set(isDisabled);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was an issue proposed in the past regarding a similar problem, but it was closed by implementing the `model()` function. However, it does not cover the existing CVA use cases.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53889\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nMaking the `model()` function to accept the `transform` option.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nOr, adding a completely new method for use cases such as `ControlValueAccessor`.

A prominent example is https://google.com which serves all locales on the same url. \r\n\r\nSetting that up with an Angular app is not easy but can be done – although combining it with PWA support seems impossible.\r\n\r\nThis is a wish/request for either **support for a localized PWA serving all locales on the same url** or **documentation for how to implement it**.\r\n\r\n### Background: Serving localized on same url\r\nUsing fx express we can serve the right bundle according to the preferred language. But because of https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17416, it is required to serve all js-files with language in the url. I do what https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17416#issuecomment-1158205744 suggests, and serves the index.html at fx. https://server/index.html and the js-files at fx. https://server/{locale}/main.44242342.js. (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17416#issuecomment-1158205744 gives more details into how to make it work with routing and all)\r\n\r\nWe have this working quite nicely at https://app.previsto.com serving 5 different languages on the same url and all deep links goes to the same content just with the app language in the user's preferred language.\r\n\r\n### Adding PWA\r\nWe cannot get PWA working though. We have tried to create a very simple app with `ng new` at https://github.com/michaelkrog/i18n-pwa-test. We have then:\r\n* added the localize package (`ng add @angular/localize`)\r\n* added the pwa package (`ng add @angular/pwa`)\r\n* adjusted angular.json to build `en-US` and `da` for production builds\r\n* added an express script for serving both languages (defaults to `en-US`)\r\n\r\nThe app serves fines, the service-worker registers itself, I can see files cached.\r\nBut the files are not served by the service-worker at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1524\" alt=\"Skærmbillede 2024-07-09 kl  11 06 18\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/681472/6b73fc53-1414-4403-9faf-55e19aae0a87\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1087\" alt=\"Skærmbillede 2024-07-09 kl  11 21 46\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/681472/76e87657-1598-46fa-9cda-6f3a56f6ee2a\">\r\n<img width=\"1497\" alt=\"Skærmbillede 2024-07-09 kl  11 23 55\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/681472/8c2b4527-71dd-4cbd-ac6d-7e5cb76c6cdf\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting the test app running\r\nTo get the test app running, do this:\r\n\r\n1.

The `dev-server` builder from these packages will currently assume a `development` configuration is present within the `build` target. The default behavior may be expanded in the future to support more arbitrary `build` target configurations. If there is third-party package usage within the `build` target, the CLI will attempt to discover a `dev-server` builder within the same package used by the `build` target.

Specifically, our builder adds plugins to webpack for handling fonts and SVGs from assets, which are subsequently included in indexHtml, along with additional scripts.\r\n\r\nI attempted to use a `buildApplicationInternal` equivalent for esbuild, but I encountered difficulties retrieving fonts and SVG information in the `onEnd` callbacks to use later in `indexHtmlTransformer` - not all information about media files is returned in metafile.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for guidance on the best approach to take when working with esbuild, considering the need to maintain our existing logic.\r\nIs it save to use `buildApplicationInternal` in the future?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I tried to run the project with ng serve. However, instead of launching Vite, webpack is initiated.\r\n\r\nThis might be because `ng serve `uses the `isEsbuildBased` function for verification, which only checks:\r\n```\r\nfunction isEsbuildBased(builderName) {\r\n    if (builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:application' ||\r\n        builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild') {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni have my custom builder name there.\r\n\r\nI might be missing something here, but there is no documentation for these cases.

The problem is that when the `MatFormFieldControl` implementation changes dynamically the field always has the initial MatFormFieldControl CSS class, for example if the initial control is a `mat-input` and later changes to a `mat-select` the CSS class on the field will always be `mat-mdc-form-field-type-mat-input`\r\n\r\nNote: The documentation says the prefix for the generated CSS class is `mat-form-field-type` but the real ones have the prefix `mat-mdc-form-field-type`. This could be a documentation bug or a regression from the legacy controls, but the prefix is a different bug that this one I am reporting.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/qbaesq\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. The demo shows two fields one that initially uses a `mat-input` and the other a `mat-select`\r\n2. The button on the top switch the implementations of MatFormFieldControl used on the fields\r\n3. After the switch an error is shown below each field, the error is a check that the field contains the correct CSS class for the control implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNo error should be shown because each field switch dynamically the control generated CSS class.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nFields don't change to the control CSS class dynamically, it always stays on the same initial class.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 18.0.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.6\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chromium\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Linux

Despite the signal being set to an empty string, the input is still displaying 'a'\r\n\r\n_Note: the signal state is correctly used to filter, which means that clicking on the input will display all values (despite the displayed 'a', which should supposedly be used to filter). For example, if you change the code to do `this.currentFruit.set('apple')` and reproduce this bug again, only the Apple element will be displayed when clicking a second time on the autocomplete (despite having only 'a' displayed)_ \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input should reflect the signal state correctly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input is not updated according to the signal state.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.6\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu, probably? (this comes from the Stackblitz)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29388","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(chips-autocomplete): Signal with two-way binding on an autocomplete with chips is not updating input\" (#29388)"},{"Id":"2392439262","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-05T12:58:13","Actor":"Opcyc-Ben","Number":"29385","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Datepicker/DateFilterFn): DateFilterFn signature does not indicate possible 'Moment' types, instead includes 'null' and return value is not explained either","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nThere is no indication that DateFilterFn can be handed a 'Moment' type value.\r\nThe filter function is also sometimes called with null as an argument, regardless of project setup, though no explanation is ever given as to what 'null' even conceptually means:\r\nIt's a Date filter.

The original proposal involved passing an explicit `<any>` as a generic argument. However, it turns out that this causes serious backwards-compatibility problems, because `any` is not the correct value type in all cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider `FormArray`:\r\n```\r\nlet c = new FormArray<any>([new FormControl(0)]);\r\nc.at(0).valueChanges.subscribe(v => {});\r\n```\r\nThis will trigger a compiler warning, because `c.at(0)` has type `any`. In fact, the correct type for `c.at(0)` is `AbstractControl<any>`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, opting out with `<any>` is not the correct solution.\r\n\r\nI discussed several possible alternatives with @alxhub, and we concluded that the best approach is to provide alises for untyped versions of the forms classes.

Currently it is nog possible to mark these dropdowns as touched, when the `markAllAsTouched` method on the parent form is called. In order to do this you have to update the component yourself some other way\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nadd an optional `markAsTouched()` or `writeTouched(value: boolean)` method to the ControlValueAccessor interface, that gets called whenever the parent form tries to update the touched status of the formControl.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI've included the parent FormControl in the component with `FormGroupDirective`. Like this...\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconstructor(private rootFormGroup: FormGroupDirective) {\r\n}\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  ...\r\n  this.rootControl = this.rootFormGroup.get(this.formControlName);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then just use the touched property of the rootControl in addition to the touched property of the individual child controls\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to just declare another `Input() touched = false` in the component, and update that value manually whenever you call the `markAllAsTouched` on the parent form.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45089","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"add markAsTouched to ControlValueAccessor interface\" (#45089)"},{"Id":"1138296050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-15T09:29:30","Actor":"MBAatEJOT","Number":"45087","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove \"no suitable injecttion token\" error for abstract classes","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen compiling a library, which since angular 13 forces you to use the Ivy-Compiler it creates errors like\r\n\r\n> No suitable injection token for parameter 'someParameter' of class 'SomeBaseComponent'.\r\n\r\neven on abstract classes.\r\n\r\nThis is totally illogical because by definition a abstract class can not be instantiated.

After enough time has elapsed, or after you've restarted the app an arbitrary amount of times, it will eventually get into the memory leaking state\r\n    - therefore, if my coworkers and I download the repo, then run the app, it seems to be a coin toss on whether or not this bug gets reproduced right away\r\n    - if you're one of the lucky few that doesn't get it to happen right away, perhaps try it on a different computer, or wait a couple minutes and refresh the web app a couple times\r\n- the fact that it doesn't happen first try every time makes it hard to prove that their is a bug with this minimal reproduction app\r\n    - I've included screen shots in the stack overflow post (near the bottom), that proves that this is indeed happening\r\n    - it does however happen every time with a much larger production app that I'm working on\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kevinpbaker/angular-memory-killer\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nThere is no error thrown.

As in most common angular applications, we have a global stylesheet in which we import the aforementioned dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to Angular v13 and its toolchain, we noticed an unexpected increase in the production mode bundle size. Inspecting the build stats, we found out that such increase was concentrated in the main `styles.css` file. With a deeper inspection in the minified file, we found out that many of the global imports were duplicated in the output stylesheet.\r\n\r\nFor us, this is a regression, since before the upgrade this duplication did not occur.\r\n\r\nThe link below brings to a Github repository where we demonstrate the issue with a simple `@angular/material` import. The branches are organized as follows:\r\n\r\n`master` -> Angular 12, works as expected\r\n`feature/angular-13` -> Angular 13, duplicate entries in built style.css\r\n\r\nWe can also provide the unminified versions of the built styles.css bundles (v12 and v13, ready to be compared). Built from the same sources, the v13 indeed does have duplicate rules, while the v12 does not.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/ibanjo/angular13-duplicate-styles-issue\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNo exception, just an unexpected increase in the bundle size due to duplicate style rules.

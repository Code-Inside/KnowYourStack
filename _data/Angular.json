I wasn't sure if this was an issue with Angular or @angular-eslint.\r\n\r\nI recently migrated a legacy app originally created manually with Angular 2 (not generated by the CLI) to an Angular CLI app using Angular 13. After this work was done, I added the linter by running _ng lint_. The CLI prompted me about adding the required libraries, etc, to enable the linter, and I accepted. Everything seemed to install correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, afterward, when trying to run the linter, I got an error saying that the setup was incorrect (original error message has been lost). I found the cause was that, in angular.json, the linter was configured to use the _src_ folder (as Angular apps do) as the location of the code (_lint->options->lintFilePatterns_ value). However, in the crazy old app I'd updated, the location of the source code was not under a folder named _src_.\r\n\r\nI understand this is probably a rare edge case, and I regret not naming that source folder _src_ to be consistent (hindsight!). If it would be possible for the process that sets up the linter to use the _sourceRoot_ value in _angular.json_ to determine the correct folder that might be helpful. This is a _minor_ issue. Thank you for all the hard work you've done with Angular!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.0.1\r\nNode: 16.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.0.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1400.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.1\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.1\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

I've successfully gone from 7->10 so far (going major to major using the guide). The command I'm using is what is published, ```ng update @angular/core@11 @angular/cli@11```. I get a series of angular dependencies that cannot be resolved. I have tried with ```--force``` with no success, and when I try ```--legacy-peer-deps``` I get an error that it is not a dependency. I've deleted my package-lock.json and tried again also with no success. I've also tried ```npx @angular/cli@11 update @angular/core@11 @angular/cli@11 ``` both with and without ```--force```.\r\n\r\nI also downgraded node to 14.9 as I saw recommended on StackOverflow but no success.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThese are my dependencies and dev dependencies in my package.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"^10.2.7\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/flex-layout\": \"^10.0.0-beta.32\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/material\": \"^10.2.7\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"git-describe\": \"^4.0.4\",\r\n    \"jwt-decode\": \"^2.2.0\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"~6.6.7\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.0.0\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"~0.10.2\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.1002.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~10.2.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"~10.2.5\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~3.3.8\",\r\n    \"@types/jasminewd2\": \"~2.0.3\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^12.11.1\",\r\n    \"codelyzer\": \"^5.1.2\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~3.5.0\",\r\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~5.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~5.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter\": \"~3.0.2\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~4.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^1.5.0\",\r\n    \"protractor\": \"~7.0.0\",\r\n    \"ts-node\": \"~7.0.0\",\r\n    \"tslint\": \"~6.1.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~4.0.8\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nnpm ERR! code ERESOLVE\r\nnpm ERR!

The container spans the full width of the view and the button it positioned to the top right of the container. I would like to position the overlay so that it is under the button but connected to the container. When I click the button, I expect the overlay to be positioned correctly within the view.\r\n\r\nFrom my initial investigation, the issue seems to be related to the `max-width` and `max-height` CSS attributes provided by the `.cdk-overlay-pane` https://github.com/angular/components/blob/2f9a59a24c0464cbed7f54cbeb5cba73e6007715/src/cdk/overlay/_index.scss#L62-L63\r\n\r\nIn my stackblitz sample, I copied over these attributes into the [`styles.css` file](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-knuuwz?file=src/styles.css) (line 56-57). If those lines are commented out/removed, the overlay will work as intended. It appears that when attempting to calculate whether or not the overlay will be within the view, the min-width and min-height will affect the calculation. Also good to note that if the overlay is connected to the button instead of the container, the overlay will also work as inteded. However, for my specific use case, that is not possible due to other technical limitations.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-knuuwz?file=src/app/app.component.ts\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is that, regardless of which element the overlay is connected it, it will be positioned correctly within the view.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen attempting to position the overlay, the overlay will be pushed outside of the view\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 12.2.11\r\n- CDK/Material: 12.2.11\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome/Edge\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25059","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/overlay): Overlay out of viewport bounds\" (#25059)"},{"Id":"1267999450","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-10T21:07:55","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"25057","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: add select example to mdc-migration integration test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25057","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: add select example to mdc-migration integration test\" (#25057)"},{"Id":"1267965435","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-10T20:14:23","Actor":"atrawally","Number":"25056","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs/typography-guide): Defining a level","State":"closed","Body":"fix(docs/typography-guide): Defining a level\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in the Topography Guide where a function was incorrectly named.

I assume that it's only done once to optimise performance which makes sense. \r\n\r\nHowever, building higher levels of UX responsiveness into DropLists and Drag items often means altering their size. The particular example that I am working with at the moment is that of enlarging a drop area when the drag begins.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to manually trigger the CdkDropList to re-compute the height of both itself and any components within it (or at the very least just itself) so that it can respond to changes in the UI. \r\n\r\ne.g. to have a method like: `cdkDropList.recomputeSizes()`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for users to drag items into an empty list, I'd like to enlarge a target drop Area on drag start. And so on drag start, I apply a class to the DropList that changes its height. The problem is that while the DropList itself grows in height, the effective drop-zone does not. It seems that although the CdkDropList has increased in height, Angular is using its own internal calculation of the original height to determine the dropZone.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168592/172834247-26f056dc-2846-4a5c-b34f-e766e04cadc3.mov\r\n\r\nIn the recording above you can see how the drop area is enlarged on drag start. The `cdkDropList` element is indicated using the green dotted line. \r\n\r\nHowever you can see that although the DropList is enlarged to make it easier to drop the CdkDrag item into it, the majority of the list area will not receive the CdkDrag item. In fact it seems that the DropList will only receive the CdkDrag item once it enters the drop area that the list originally covered before it was enlarged. \r\n\r\nThe same effect is not observed when the minimum height set statically to be the larger size:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168592/172837498-1b57ce31-5378-44b3-8e56-c143be296f66.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to trigger the list to recompute its own area so that it can behave correctly relative to its new,  larger size. \r\n\r\n### Bonus extra\r\nCreating advanced drag and drop behaviour can require resizing items in the list as well as just the list itself. It would be really nice to be able to trigger the DropList to be able to recompute the size of all elements and not just the drop area. \r\n\r\nAn example of this is collapsing elements in the list when a drag begins. The example below illustrates using a single-tiered DropList to mimic the behaviour of a nested list. The mimicry is done by removing the child elements entirely from the list before the drag begins,\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168592/172834522-f9834d85-245a-4da5-ad90-23d409334907.mov\r\n\r\nAlthough the example above illustrates what looks like a nested list, it is in fact just a single-level list that uses indentation to create the illusion of nesting. The \"child\" nodes are removed from the list on drag start and then re-inserted after drag finish. Happily, this seems to work robustly. \r\n\r\nHowever it would be extremely useful to be able to change the items in the list during the drag process itself. Imagine for instance dragging an item over a folder that you wish to open. I can imagine that inserting items into a list during drag might be very complicated to code. However, a simple workaround could be achieved by having the items in the list from the start but with zero height and then enlarging their height when the parent folder opens. \r\n\r\nHowever this would again require the list to recompute the sizing of all elements so that we don't end up with an effect similar to that below. In this example, the child nodes aren't consistently removed from the tree before CdkDrag computes the item heights. And so the DropList calculates the sizing of all elements within it and only then are some of them removed - which results in the peculiar effect we see. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168592/172831293-fb17441d-926b-41e3-9a37-2982bffaa444.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nIf my understanding of the system is correct then all of this could potentially be worked around *if* it were possible to manully trigger recomputation of the size and position of `CdkDropList` and `CdkDrag` elements\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25045","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(DragDropModule): Allow manual triggering of CdkDropList and CdkDragElement size recomputation\" (#25045)"},{"Id":"1265844790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-09T11:07:31","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25044","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(cdk/drag-drop): move sorting and positioning logic into a separate class","State":"closed","Body":"This is an internal reorganization of the drop list to make it easier to eventually add support for mixed orientation.

The future mixed orientation will likely move the DOM nodes themselves which would've been difficult to manage if we kept the positioning logic within `DropListRef`.\r\n* Moves some of the DOM-related utilities into the `dom` directory in order to reduce clutter in the root of the package.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25044","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(cdk/drag-drop): move sorting and positioning logic into a separate class\" (#25044)"},{"Id":"1265282570","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-08T21:00:09","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"25043","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(cdk/scrolling): Docs for new virtual scroll features added in #24394","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25043","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(cdk/scrolling): Docs for new virtual scroll features added in #24394\" (#25043)"},{"Id":"1264662679","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-08T12:25:03","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"25042","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code to 7848e7d","State":"open","Body":"[![Mend Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/dev-infra-private](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `136fa6e` -> `7848e7d` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `91ba217` -> `2207080` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

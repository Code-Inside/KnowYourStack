This feature would enable organisations to maintain, upgrade, and scale large Angular applications more effectively while reducing technical debt and deployment risks.\nProblem Statement\nCurrent Challenges\nVersion Lock-in: Large enterprise applications are often locked into specific Angular versions due to the complexity and risk associated with major version upgrades. This creates technical debt and prevents teams from leveraging newer Angular features and performance improvements.\nMonolithic Upgrade Constraints: Traditional Angular applications require complete application upgrades, which can take months or years for large code bases, during which teams cannot adopt new features or security patches from newer Angular versions.\nTeam Independence: In large organisations, different teams may work on different parts of the application but are forced to coordinate Angular version upgrades, slowing down development velocity and creating cross-team dependencies.\nLegacy Code Maintenance: Organisations struggle to maintain older Angular code while simultaneously developing new features with modern Angular capabilities.\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n**Proposed Solution**\n\nMulti-Version Microfrontend Architecture\nImplement a comprehensive microfrontend solution that supports:\n\n**Angular v14 Support:** Maintain existing applications built on Angular 14 with full feature compatibility\n**Angular v16 Support:** Enable teams to leverage standalone components, required inputs, and improved developer experience\n**Angular v19 Support:** Access to latest features including improved hydration, new lifecycle hooks, and performance optimizations\n**Angular v20 Support:** Future-proof architecture for upcoming Angular releases and features\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n# Alternatives Considered\n\n## 1. Complete Application Rewrite\n**Approach**: Rebuild entire application using latest Angular version\n**Rejected**: 6-24 month timeline, high risk, expensive, potential loss of domain knowledge\n\n## 2. Monolithic Upgrade\n**Approach**: Upgrade entire application version by version in coordinated manner\n**Rejected**: Blocks development, requires cross-team coordination, prevents incremental feature adoption\n\n## 3. IFrame Integration\n**Approach**: Deploy different Angular versions as separate applications connected via iframes\n**Rejected**: Poor user experience, complex state sharing, SEO issues, browser security restrictions\n\n## 4. Hybrid Framework Approach\n**Approach**: Migrate parts to React/Vue while maintaining Angular core\n**Rejected**: Multiple framework expertise required, inconsistent UX, increased complexity and bundle size\n\n## 5. Web Components (Angular Elements)\n**Approach**: Convert Angular components to Web Components for cross-version compatibility\n**Rejected**: Limited Angular features, performance overhead, complex state management\n\n## 6. Server-Side Composition\n**Approach**: Use server-side includes to compose different Angular applications\n**Rejected**: Infrastructure complexity, poor client-side state management, increased latency\n\n## 7. Docker Microservices\n**Approach**: Deploy each Angular version as separate containerized services\n**Rejected**: Not suitable for frontend integration, network latency, complex local development\n\n## 8. Angular Universal Version Switching\n**Approach**: Server-side rendering with different Angular versions based on routes\n**Rejected**: Complex infrastructure, hydration challenges, limited client-side state sharing\n\n## Why Multi-Version Microfrontend is Optimal\n\n✅ **Maintains Angular ecosystem benefits**\n✅ **Enables incremental version adoption**\n✅ **Seamless user experience**\n✅ **Minimizes migration risk and cost**\n✅ **Preserves existing Angular expertise**\n✅ **Allows parallel team development**","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61984","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Microfrontend\" (#61984)"},{"Id":"3133136976","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-10T13:02:44","Actor":"Avcharov","Number":"61983","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(adev): add \"Edit this page on Github\" hyperlink in each page footer","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\n\nWhen angular.dev site visitors find issue in documentation and want to contribute to solve problem by themselves, from first look at adev project it can be difficult to find needed file where to make changes.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProposing to add \"Edit this page on GitHub\" or \"Contribute to this page on GitHub\" hyperlink or popup somewhere in bottom of each page which will redirect user to GitHub adev .md file where changes should be applied.\n\nIt should simplify involvement of community into small docu bugs fixing.  \n\nSomething similar is done by this [Link](https://module-federation.io/guide/basic/rspack.html)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61983","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(adev): add \"Edit this page on Github\" hyperlink in each page footer\" (#61983)"},{"Id":"3133424141","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-10T13:00:20","Actor":"xianshenglu","Number":"61985","RawContent":null,"Title":"Doc: Angular will run change detection when \"New inputs to component with OnPush\"?","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nI think this paragraph is incorrect. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd32fac1-1333-4ba7-b717-4e36f093e3e1)\n\nThe changes to the `input` will not let Angular run change detection.

[1.497 seconds]\n\nPage reload sent to client(s).\nInitial chunk files | Names         |  Raw size\nmain.js             | main          |   7.00 kB | \nLazy chunk files    | Names         |  Raw size\nworker-4KFG4YB2.js  | shared-worker | 404 bytes | \n\nThis behavior forces any developer debugging the worker via browser tools (like chrome://inspect/#workers or Edge's equivalent) to manually close the detached debugger and re-open a new inspector for the newly named worker file after every single save.\nThis makes the development and debugging workflow for Shared Workers extremely tedious and inefficient, as it's impossible to maintain a persistent debugging session with breakpoints.\nThis issue is specific to the development server's file hashing strategy.

That override breaks Angular Material’s default for `<mat-icon>`, which is `display: inline-block`. As a result, any `<mat-icon>` inside a `<mat-icon-button>` ends up off-center (because `inline-block` plus Tailwind’s inherited letter-spacing shifts it). This issue **only** occurs when Tailwind is loaded—if you run a bare Material setup without Tailwind, the icon stays perfectly centered.\n\nIn this GIF, you can see:  \n- **Default (with Tailwind + `display: inline-block`)** → icon is off-center  \n- **Modified (`display: block`)** → icon is correctly centered  \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f85259-d479-4e2c-9753-3e3e98b80702)\n\n---\n\n**Workaround**  \nYou can fix it globally by adding this to your CSS:\n\n```css\n.mdc-icon-button .mat-icon {\n  display: block;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Change**  \nSince an icon inside a `mat-icon-button` doesn’t actually need `inline-block`, it would be helpful if the default were changed to `display: block`. That way, icons remain centered even when Tailwind (or any similar CSS reset) is used.\n\n---\n\n**Side Note**  \nThe official docs still show `matIconButton` in code examples, but in your HTML it must be written as `mat-icon-button`. I copy-pasted it and was confused for a moment 😅.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-aksf9tvg?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIcons inside `mat-icon-button` should be perfectly centered by default, even when Tailwind is loaded.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen Tailwind is used, its Preflight reset applies `letter-spacing: inherit` to buttons. This overrides Angular Material’s default `display: inline-block` for `<mat-icon>`, causing the icon to appear off-center inside `mat-icon-button`.\n\n### Environment\n\n```\nAngular CLI: 19.1.9\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.5.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.4\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router, service-worker\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.9\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.5\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.5\n@angular/cdk                    19.1.2\n@angular/cli                    19.1.9\n@angular/fire                   19.2.0\n@angular/material               19.1.2\n@angular/ssr                    19.1.5\n@schematics/angular             19.1.5\nng-packagr                      19.1.2\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31304","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-icon-button & mat-icon): mat-icon misaligned in mat-icon-button when using Tailwind\" (#31304)"},{"Id":"3124615960","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-06T12:17:47","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31303","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slide-toggle): use system colors","State":"open","Body":"Realigns the slide toggle back to the Material 2 switch spec with a surface-colored handle","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31303","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slide-toggle): use system colors\" (#31303)"},{"Id":"3121638603","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-05T15:23:40","Actor":"devversion","Number":"31299","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: fix schematics not respecting new `-module.ts` suffix","State":"closed","Body":"Angular CLI generates `-module.ts` suffix when using `--standalone: false`.

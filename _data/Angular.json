The code would be like so :\r\n- first use jsdom to instance doompurify:\r\n```\r\nimport jsdom  from \"jsdom\";\r\nimport createDOMPurify from 'dompurify';\r\nconst { JSDOM } = jsdom;\r\nconst window = new JSDOM('').window;\r\n```\r\n- then try to purify a value and set it \"innerHTML\" property of any element in angular, like :\r\n```\r\nthis._html = <any>DOMPurify.sanitize(some_string,{})\r\nthis._renderer.setProperty(this._el.nativeElement,\"innerHTML\",this._html);\r\n```\r\nThis will result in the element not having any content. If I remove jsdom things work. Something is causing a conflict here and we can't figure out where the issue is. We had to downgrade because it was a real blocker.\r\nYou don't have to use it with dompurify, simply importing \"jsdom\" in the same file where you do this._renderer.setProperty... makes the element be blank.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49588","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Using jsdom with angular results in blank element\" (#49588)"},{"Id":"1639861914","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-24T20:24:31","Actor":"r6squeegee","Number":"49586","RawContent":null,"Title":"guide/http misleading comment on Observable unsubscribe","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nThe documentation is slightly misleading / confusing with regards to HttpClient Observable results.\r\n\r\nit has a note saying \"You should always unsubscribe from an observable when a component is destroyed.\" which is generally true; however specifically for HttpClient resulting Observables, my understanding is that it is not true. \r\n\r\nUnless I'm horribly mistaken (along with a lot of other people...) you do not have to unsubscribe from httpClient subscribe() calls.

In our communication to be able to identify which label we are talking about this description would be really helpful. \r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n\r\nAdd an extra parameter to `ng extract-18n` that would also generate the `<context context-type=\"description\">` tags for duplicated messages.\r\n\r\nAccording to `http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#context` I do not see any problem with adding one more XML tag to the `<context-group purpose=\"location\">`s, e.g.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<trans-unit id=\"3016960930275947563\" datatype=\"html\">\r\n  <source>Owner</source>\r\n  <context-group purpose=\"location\">\r\n    <context context-type=\"sourcefile\">src/app/detail/detail.component.html</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"linenumber\">81</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"description\">Owner label in detail form</context>\r\n  </context-group>\r\n  <context-group purpose=\"location\">\r\n    <context context-type=\"sourcefile\">src/app/search/search.component.html</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"linenumber\">54</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"description\">Owner label in search filter</context>\r\n  </context-group>\r\n  <context-group purpose=\"location\">\r\n    <context context-type=\"sourcefile\">src/app/detail/search-result-table.component.ts</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"linenumber\">111</context>\r\n    <context context-type=\"description\">Owner table column header in search result table</context>\r\n  </context-group>\r\n  <note priority=\"1\" from=\"description\">Owner label in detail form</note>\r\n</trans-unit>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49564","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"extract-i18n: Extract `description` for every instance of duplicated messages\" (#49564)"},{"Id":"1637352009","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T11:32:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"49563","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): expose `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState`","State":"open","Body":"This commits adds `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState` methods in `@angular/core` as public API and deprecated the same exported symbols in `@angular/platform-browser`.\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED:  `makeStateKey`, `StateKey` and  `TransferState` exports have been moved from `@angular/platform-browser` to `@angular/core`.

Even in a completely fresh angular project (as generated by `ng new polyfill-test`) and the canonical browserslist (as generated by `ng generate config browserslist`), the generated main.js file contains `??` operators. The default browserslist allows for Firefox 60 (as confirmed by `npx browserslist`), which does not support `??` (https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_nullish_coalescing).\r\n\r\nUsing newer functions (like `Object.fromEntries`) does also not generate the corresponding polyfills.\r\n\r\nTo my understanding (https://angular.io/guide/build#configuring-browser-compatibility) transpiling down and generating polyfills should work out of the box.

issues.\r\nIn particular, I'm using `vscode-jest-runner` extension, and when I use its codeLens option to run a single test, it fails if the components involved use i18n, because it can't find `$localize`, despite the type being listed in `tsconfig.spec.json`'s `types`. \r\nWhen running test architect from cli everything works.\r\nAt the moment my workaround is to explicitly initialize `$localize` in `test-setup.ts` with the old `import '@angular/localize/init';`, hoping this will not interfere when test are launched from cli (double initialization?).\r\nIs there any other way?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- use i18n in a component\r\n- test the component outside ng-cli\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI:

This messes up esbuild's implementation of node's module resolution algorithm since encountering `ENOTDIR` causes esbuild to continue its search (since it's a normal condition) while other encountering other errors causes esbuild to fail with an I/O error (since it's an unexpected condition). You can encounter this issue in practice if you use node's legacy `NODE_PATH` feature to tell esbuild to resolve node modules in a custom directory that was not installed by npm. This release works around this problem by converting `EINVAL` into `ENOTDIR` for the `readdir` syscall.\n\n-   Fix a minification bug with CSS `@layer` rules that have parsing errors ([#&#8203;3016](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3016))\n\n    CSS at-rules [require either a `{}` block or a semicolon at the end](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#consume-at-rule). Omitting both of these causes esbuild to treat the rule as an unknown at-rule. Previous releases of esbuild had a bug that incorrectly removed unknown at-rules without any children during minification if the at-rule token matched an at-rule that esbuild can handle. Specifically [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) can generate `@layer` rules with parsing errors, and empty `@layer` rules cannot be removed because they have side effects (`@layer` didn't exist when esbuild's CSS support was added, so esbuild wasn't written to handle this). This release changes esbuild to no longer discard `@layer` rules with parsing errors when minifying (the rule `@layer c` has a parsing error):\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original input */\n    @&#8203;layer a {\n      @&#8203;layer b {\n        @&#8203;layer c\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Old output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b;\n\n    /* New output (with --minify) */\n    @&#8203;layer a.b.c;\n    ```\n\n-   Unterminated strings in CSS are no longer an error\n\n    The CSS specification provides [rules for handling parsing errors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/syndata.html#parsing-errors). One of those rules is that user agents must close strings upon reaching the end of a line (i.e., before an unescaped line feed, carriage return or form feed character), but then drop the construct (declaration or rule) in which the string was found. For example:\n\n    ```css\n    p {\n      color: green;\n      font-family: 'Courier New Times\n      color: red;\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ...would be treated the same as:\n\n    ```css\n    p { color: green; color: green; }\n    ```\n\n    ...because the second declaration (from `font-family` to the semicolon after `color: red`) is invalid and is dropped.\n\n    Previously using this CSS with esbuild failed to build due to a syntax error, even though the code can be interpreted by a browser. With this release, the code now produces a warning instead of an error, and esbuild prints the invalid CSS such that it stays invalid in the output:\n\n    ```css\n    /* esbuild's new non-minified output: */\n    p {\n      color: green;\n      font-family: 'Courier New Times\n      color: red;\n      color: green;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```css\n    /* esbuild's new minified output: */\n    p{font-family:'Courier New Times\n    color: red;color:green}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>quicktype/quicktype</summary>\n\n### [`v23.0.18`](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/90fb6dd0c44f4e3f4d85e8e457c3669d75934a32...ad42fbb1ba09eb942ae9afc44a41bf1394c8c16f)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/quicktype/quicktype/compare/90fb6dd0c44f4e3f4d85e8e457c3669d75934a32...ad42fbb1ba09eb942ae9afc44a41bf1394c8c16f)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.60.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1600)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.59.3...1.60.0)\n\n-   Add support for the `pi`, `e`, `infinity`, `-infinity`, and `NaN` constants in\n    calculations.

We stopped because:\r\n\r\n* `@angular/bazel` was updated to no longer produce CommonJS devmode\r\n* It relied on `ts_library` patches to no longer produce CommonJS devmode.\r\n\r\nWe can make these changes to unblock the update, but it would be a significant effort as all `nodejs_binary` targets would need to be updated to execute ESM natively (as there obviously is no CJS anymore). This is what we did as an experiment in framework to run tests/code natively using `.mjs`. We are not going to do it here as we would rather want to put the effort into switching to a toolchain that supports ESM properly.. without patches.\r\n\r\nFor now we are just reversing the change in `ng_module` so that it still produces devmode CommonJS. Components repo will not use for tests etc, but it's there to allow for `nodejs_binary` CommonJS targets, and to avoid having to perform a large migration.

mentioned in the docs.\r\nI'd either try to refactor the code so that the context isn't lost by invoking the handler from the logic of the MatSlider component (and therefore switching the

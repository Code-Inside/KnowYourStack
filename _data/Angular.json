This is clearly wrong -- an extraneous `FormControl` has been added!\r\n\r\nThis is coming from the calculation of the result type of `fb.group(...)`. In the type definition, if we cannot detect the outer control type, [we assume it's just an unwrapped value, and automatically wrap it in `FormControl`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/14.0.0/packages/forms/src/form_builder.ts#L66).\r\n\r\nBecause the optional `{address?: FormControl<string|null>}` implicitly makes the RHS have type `FormControl<string|null>|undefined`, [the relevant condition is not satisfied](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/14.0.0/packages/forms/src/form_builder.ts#L55). In particular, the condition expects just `FormGroup<T>`, not `FormGroup<T>|undefined`. So we assume `T` is a value type, and it gets wrapped with `FormControl`.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to add the cases where `undefined` is included in the union type when detecting which control `T` is (if any).\r\n\r\nGoogle-internal bug: b/234856858\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46253","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(forms): allow FormBuilder.group(...) to accept optional fields.\" (#46253)"},{"Id":"1260005832","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-06T17:13:33","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"46247","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): add helpful info in the pipe not found error message","State":"closed","Body":"Add info to the pipe not found error message so to give some help to the developer for\r\nresolving the problem more efficiently\r\n\r\n(Note: this change also distinguishes the case in which the hosting component is standalone)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Clone [main](https://github.com/mgameover/app-n-lib/tree/main) branch\r\n2. Make sure that it builds the lib by running `npm run build-components` (ng build components)\r\n3. Update angular to v14 by  running `ng update @angular/core@14 @angular/cli@14` \r\n4.

This happens in two scenarios\n1. [When we first initialize the FormGroup](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/4a030f7308b1e9c0fe6164f4533107f79004891c/packages/forms/src/model/form_group.ts#L598-L603) (the constructor calls `_setupControl()` which binds `_onCollectionChange()` to the children\n2. [When we call](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/4a030f7308b1e9c0fe6164f4533107f79004891c/packages/forms/src/model/form_group.ts#L233-L239) `registerControl` (and associated methods)\n\nThe problem is with scenario 1: we may seed each child control with a default callback (an empty function) on init, but we don't propagate a *new* callback when we eventually bind the FormGroup to a FormGroupDirective. The child FormGroups are still working with the 'default' one. Furthermore the api is private so I don't see any way to fix this on the user side.\n\nIf we have a scenario where a child form group adds controls dynamically, and some of those controls are FormControlName directives (see stackblitz), then we fail to trigger `_updateDOMValue()` on the parent FormGroupDirective. The FormControlName directives are left with orphaned form controls.\n\nIdeally, `_registerOnCollectionChange()`  would cascade to its children (or maybe just call `_setupControls()` again).\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-iatn8h?file=src%2Fbroken-form.ts \n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 18.2.0\nNode: 20.11.1\nPackage Manager: yarn 4.4.0\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.0\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, language-service, material, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.0\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.0\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.0\n@angular/flex-layout            14.0.0-beta.41\n@schematics/angular             18.2.0\nng-packagr                      18.2.0\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.4.5\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59097","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Child Form Groups Don't Receive Updated _onCollectionChange() When FormGroupDirective Seeds Parent with Callback\" (#59097)"},{"Id":"2720977260","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-06T22:38:31","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"59077","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update actions/cache digest to 1bd1e32","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [actions/cache](https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache) | action | digest | `6849a64` -> `1bd1e32` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Here is what i understand about\n\n`linkedSignals`: For scenarios with dynamic or evolving dependency graphs, especially when conditions influence which signals are accessed.\n`computed`: For scenarios with static and predictable dependencies, where simplicity and performance optimisation are key.\n\nBut as per these the computed signals and linkedSignals gives the same output.\n\nExample code:\n\n```\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\nimport { Component, computed, linkedSignal, signal } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  imports: [CommonModule],\n  styleUrl: './app.component.scss'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'v-19';\n  isDynamic = signal(true);\n  signalA = signal(10);\n  signalB = signal(20);\n\n  // Using linkedSignal\n  dynamicResult = linkedSignal(() => {\n    return this.isDynamic() ? this.signalA() : this.signalB();\n  });\n\n  // Using computed\n  staticResult = computed(() => {\n    return this.isDynamic() ? this.signalA() : this.signalB();\n  });\n\n  constructor() {\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      this.isDynamic.set(false);\n    }, 5000);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n### Code Explanation:  \nThe above code demonstrates the dynamic behavior of `linkedSignals` and `computed` signals. It uses a boolean signal called `isDynamic`, along with two integer signals, `signalA` and `signalB`. The goal is to dynamically determine the result:  \n- When `isDynamic` is `true`, `linkedSignal` should dynamically provide `signalA` as the result.  \n- The expectation is that `linkedSignals` can handle dynamic and complex signals more effectively, whereas `computed` should not behave the same way.\n\n### Expected Outcome:  \nOnly the `linkedSignal` (i.e., `dynamicResult`) should update when there is a change in the value of `isDynamic`.\n\n### Actual Outcome:  \nBoth `linkedSignals` and `computed` behave identically in this scenario, and the result updates for both when `isDynamic` changes.\n\n### Question:  \nIf both `linkedSignals` and `computed` behave the same way in this case, what is the key difference between them? When should each be used effectively?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-yambyv?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n### Expected Outcome:  \nOnly the `linkedSignal` should update when there is a change in the value of dynamic value.\n\n### Actual Outcome:  \nBoth `linkedSignals` and `computed` behave identically in this scenario, and the result updates for both when dynamic value changes.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.2\nNode: 20.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.0.3\n... core\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.2 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.2 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.2 (cli-only)\n@schematics/angular          19.0.2 (cli-only)\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nPlease let me know if I am missing something or misunderstanding the concept.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59090","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Clarification Needed: Key Differences Between `linkedSignals` and `computed` in Dynamic Scenarios\" (#59090)"},{"Id":"2723389799","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-06T15:59:00","Actor":"saikorthivada","Number":"59089","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unexpected Invocation of `linkedSignal` Computation Despite Unchanged Source","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhile working with `linkedSignals` in the developer preview mode, I encountered some issues when comparing `linkedSignals` with `computed` signals.\n\nAccording to the documentation, when the `source` property is specified, the `computation` property should only execute when there is a change in the `source` value. However, this expected behavior is not being observed in practice.\n\nHere is the code sample\n\n```\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\nimport { Component, linkedSignal, signal } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  imports: [CommonModule],\n  styleUrl: './app.component.scss'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'v-19';\n\n  signalA = signal(10);\n  signalB = signal(20);\n\n  linkedAB = linkedSignal({\n    source: this.signalA,\n    computation: () => {\n      console.log('Updated');\n      return this.signalA() + this.signalB()\n    }\n  })\n\n  constructor() {\n    setInterval(() => {\n      this.signalB.update((previous) => previous + 10);\n    }, 5000);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Code Explanation:\n\nI have created two signals, `signalA` and `signalB`. After the component loads, I used a `setInterval` in the constructor to update the value of `signalB` by adding 10 to its previous value every 5 seconds.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n\nThe `console.log('Updated');` statement inside the `linkedSignal` computation should not execute because only `signalA` is defined as the `source`, and I am not updating `signalA`.\n\n### Actual Outcome:\n\nDespite only updating `signalB` through the interval, the `linkedSignal` computation callback is still being executed, logging `'Updated'` to the console and recalculating the value of `linkedAB`.\n\n### Concern:\n\nIf this behavior occurs, I am unclear about the purpose of the `source` property in `linkedSignals`, as it seems to be ineffective in preventing recomputation when only `signalB` is updated.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ns6muo?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n### Expected Behavior:  \nThe `linkedSignals` computation should only be invoked when the `source` value is updated. If the `source` remains unchanged, the computation should not execute.\n\n### Actual Behavior:  \nCurrently, the computation is being invoked regardless of whether the `source` value is updated, indicating that it is not depending on the `source` property as intended.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.2\nNode: 20.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.0.3\n... core\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1900.2 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/core         19.0.2 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.0.2 (cli-only)\n@schematics/angular          19.0.2 (cli-only)\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nKindly let me know if there is any issue with my code or if I have misunderstood something.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59089","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unexpected Invocation of `linkedSignal` Computation Despite Unchanged Source\" (#59089)"},{"Id":"2723026078","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-06T13:08:47","Actor":"hawkgs","Number":"59088","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: set syntax highlighting to the remaining Markdown code examples blocks","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[actions/cache](https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache) now integrates with the new cache service (v2) APIs.\n\nThe new service will gradually roll out as of **February 1st, 2025**. The legacy service will also be sunset on the same date. Changes in these release are **fully backward compatible**.\n\n**We are deprecating some versions of this action**. We recommend upgrading to version `v4` or `v3` as soon as possible before **February 1st, 2025.** (Upgrade instructions below).\n\nIf you are using pinned SHAs, please use the SHAs of versions `v4.2.0` or `v3.4.0`\n\nIf you do not upgrade, all workflow runs using any of the deprecated [actions/cache](https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache) will fail.\n\nUpgrading to the recommended versions will not break your workflows.\n\nRead more about the change & access the migration guide: [reference to the

However, the current implementation requires adding a separate configuration in the application's providers list, specifying which routes require SSR.\n\n```\nexport const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [\n  {\n    path: '**',\n    renderMode: RenderMode.Server\n  }\n];\n```\n\n`provideServerRoutesConfig(serverRoutes)`\n\nThis approach, while functional, introduces redundancy and makes the configuration less intuitive.\n\n**Proposal**:\n\nAllow specifying the renderMode directly within the route definition itself. This would streamline the configuration, making it more straightforward and easier to understand. Developers could define the rendering mode for each route without needing a separate list in the providers.\n\n**Example**:\n\n```\nimport { Routes, RenderMode } from '@angular/router';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    component: HomeComponent,\n    renderMode: RenderMode.Server\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'about',\n    component: AboutComponent,\n    renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'dashboard',\n    component: DashboardComponent,\n    renderMode: RenderMode.Client // Default\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- Simplified Configuration: No need for a separate provider configuration. The renderMode is specified where routes are defined.\n- Better Readability: The rendering mode is directly associated with the route, making it easier to understand at a glance.\n- Reduced Redundancy: Avoids the need to maintain a separate list of server-rendered routes, reducing the risk of mismatch or errors.\n- Backward Compatibility:\n\nIf the renderMode property is not specified in the route, it would default to RenderMode.Client, ensuring backward compatibility.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.3\nNode: 20.12.2\nPackage Manager: npm 10.6.0\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.3\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router, service-worker, ssr\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.3\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.3\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.3\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.3\n@schematics/angular             19.0.3\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29074","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhance renderMode Configuration for Angular Router\" (#29074)"},{"Id":"2720910532","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-05T19:24:30","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"29066","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): webpack config transform for karma","State":"closed","Body":"This PR is 10% passing an argument that got dropped during refactoring and 90% finding a way to test the behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm making up a new concept for the harness (`additionalExecuteArguments`) which is pretty ugly but I couldn't think of a cleaner way of doing it.

If you want to use the defaults of your connected position strategy, without providing positions to a position's strategy, it would be helpful to leverage css classnames that were automatically applied depending on whatever the position the cdk chose to apply.  \n\n### Use Case\n\nA use case is exactly what you are doing in your autocomplete trigger.  Rather than using an explicit css class we could leverage selectors supplied by the cdk overlay.  For example, if the overlay was positioned above an element, the cdk would automatically apply '.cdk-overlay-positioned-above') to the parent element so we could leverage it to directly apply styles to the content in our overlay appropriately without needing to do so explicitly in our code.  A common use case other than corner radius would be css animations where we would need to know the position to appropriately target our animations (slide down or slide up, for example).  This would simplify our code and make applying styles under different positions much easier.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30146","RelatedDescription":"Open issue

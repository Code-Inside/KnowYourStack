When I convert this component to a standalone component, my tests fail with NG0300 but the new component works fine in the application. I'm assuming I am doing something wrong in configuring the testing module or that there is some bug in it but I'm unable to find documentation covering this case. The full component:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Input, Component, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { NgFor, NgIf, NgClass } from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\nexport interface Node {\r\n  cssClasses?: string;\r\n  text?: string;\r\n  nodes?: Node[];\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: '[app-nester]',\r\n  template: `<ng-container *ngFor=\"let node of nodes\">\r\n    <ng-container>\r\n      <ng-container *ngIf=\"node.text as text\">\r\n        <div [ngClass]=\"node.cssClasses!\">{{ text }}</div>\r\n      </ng-container>\r\n      <ng-container *ngIf=\"node.nodes as nodes\">\r\n        <div [ngClass]=\"node.cssClasses!\" app-nester [nodes]=\"node.nodes\"></div>\r\n      </ng-container>\r\n    </ng-container>\r\n  </ng-container> `,\r\n  // standalone: true,\r\n  // imports: [NgFor, NgIf, NgClass, forwardRef(() => NesterComponent)],\r\n})\r\nexport class NesterComponent {\r\n  @Input() nodes: Node[] | null = null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto convert to standalone I used the new migration and it added these commented out lines and imports.\r\n\r\nMy Tests:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { ComponentFixture, TestBed, waitForAsync } from '@angular/core/testing';\r\n\r\nimport { NesterComponent } from './nester.component';\r\n\r\ndescribe('NesterComponent', () => {\r\n  let component: NesterComponent;\r\n  let fixture: ComponentFixture<NesterComponent>;\r\n\r\n  // remove for standalone version\r\n  beforeEach(waitForAsync(() => {\r\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({ declarations: [NesterComponent] }).compileComponents();\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n  // standalone version from migration:\r\n  // beforeEach(waitForAsync(() => {\r\n  //   TestBed.configureTestingModule({ imports: [NesterComponent] }).compileComponents();\r\n  // }));\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(() => {\r\n    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(NesterComponent);\r\n    component = fixture.componentInstance;\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should create', () => {\r\n    expect(component).toBeDefined();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should render text', () => {\r\n    component.nodes = [\r\n      { cssClasses: 'test1', text: 'test1' },\r\n      {\r\n        cssClasses: 'test2',\r\n        nodes: [{ cssClasses: 'not in result' }, { text: 'test4' }],\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        cssClasses: 'test5',\r\n        nodes: [],\r\n      },\r\n    ];\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n    expect(fixture.nativeElement).toMatchSnapshot();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain in this case all the migration did was change `declarations` to `imports`\r\n\r\nThe above functions and test passes... however if I switch it to the standalone version of both files then the test fails (as far as I can tell it still works though, this is just a test problem).\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```\r\nFAIL  src/app/shared/nester/nester.component.spec.ts (13.262 s)\r\n  NesterComponent\r\n    √ should create (322 ms)\r\n    × should render text (826 ms)\r\n\r\n  ● NesterComponent › should render text\r\n\r\n    NG0300: Multiple components match node with tagname div: NesterComponent and NesterComponent.

The application works fine without the \"optimization\" flag set to true in the angular.json file. But when set to true, some code remains in the main....js that causes an error, when the page gets loaded.\r\nThe console log states \"main.bc110eb6fa951c13.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: hd is not defined\". \r\nHere is the part of the code, that causes this issue:\r\n\r\n`class EP extends hd {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation (and also turning off the optimization flag), I found out that this code originally looked like that:\r\n\r\n`\r\nclass ReferenceExpr extends ExpressionBase {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nSo the ExpressionBase class is missing. Which is also fine, I guess, since it is not used in the code and hence was removed by tree shaking. Also the ReferenceExpr class is, as far as I can tell, not used in the code. When I search for a usage of the class \"EP\" in the optimised code, there is no location where I could find it. \r\n\r\nVersion 15.2.4 worked without any issues. Did I miss anything in the upgrade process, or is it a bug in the build optimisation?\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nmain.1dde1c799c90e486.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: hd is not defined\r\n    at 83 (main.1dde1c799c90e486.js:1:290279)\r\n    at a (runtime.de42e30e1a22c589.js:1:143)\r\n    at main.1dde1c799c90e486.js:1:4227714\r\n    at n (runtime.de42e30e1a22c589.js:1:951)\r\n    at main.1dde1c799c90e486.js:1:55\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.0.3\r\nNode: 18.12.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.19.3\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1600.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             16.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25287","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tree shaking: unused code remains in productive app\" (#25287)"},{"Id":"1732612002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-30T18:51:21","Actor":"clydin","Number":"25288","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): correctly emit AOT class metadata in development","State":"closed","Body":"When using the default Webpack-based builder, the AOT-generated class metadata was incorrectly removed in all cases.

At the time I started, what I was thinking of was specific to a set of tables I intended to use in an administrative context, so I navigated to something like /src/modules/sales/costing-tool/components/templates and typed \"ng g c admin-table\". \r\n\r\nBefore I hit enter, I thought about it and decided that rather than creating a module and specific use component that I'd rather make a general use component for generating p-tables dynamically & that it belonged in a shared module rather than a feature module. I thought I'd already deleted the CLI command out of the terminal so without looking I typed cd.. and hit enter. Which was the beginning of a 2+ hour headache that ended up costing me 2 days of work and which potentially could've cost me all the work I've done since May 5. \r\n\r\nSo the command I effectively entered was \"ng g c admin-tablecd..\", and what happened is that the CLI was able to somehow dodge the OS level naming safety conventions & it created a folder named admin-tablecd.., which caused there to be an unresolvable reference in my project structure and made it unloadable and unbuildable. And there was nothing I could do to delete the offending folder.

This widget takes a value as an input and sets it to the form control bound to the slider:\r\n```\r\n// template\r\n<mat-slider>\r\n  <input matSliderThumb [formControl]=\"sliderValue\">\r\n</>\r\n\r\n// component\r\n@Input() value: number\r\n\r\nsliderValue = new FormControl(0, {nonNullable: true})\r\n\r\nngOnChanges() {\r\n  this.sliderValue.setValue(this.value) // <-- this\r\n\r\n  // derived value used in the template\r\n  this.isDefaultValue = this.value === 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like the `.setValue` call breaks change detection. The `isDefaultValue` value is properly derived (as per console.log output), but is not reflected in HTML. It will get updated after the next interaction with the widget (which triggers change detection), or after manually calling `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`.\r\n\r\nThis happens with a single-handle or a two-handle slider.\r\n\r\nIt only happens when the value is bound to the slider via a form control. If I pass the value as a property binding instead (`[value]=\"sliderValue.value\"`), everything works fine.\r\nAlso moving the `isDefaultValue` calculation up to be before the `.setValue` call magically solves it, too.\r\n\r\n![slider-cd](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/1004015/476b5b2b-d1dd-4329-9c82-337bbc344dd7)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/xsoedg?file=src%2Fexample%2Fapp-widget.component.ts\r\n1.

the ripple event management was different, probably not delegated, but mainly it was using the bubble phase of events. with v15 this was changed and using global delegation causes all the ancestor ripples to fire.\r\n\r\nThe fact that ripple is now using the capture phase makes it worse, cause it is virtually impossible for the developer to stop/control these events to avoid the aforementioned ancestor ripple cascade.\r\n\r\nBy chaning the RippleEventManager::_delegateEventHandler (and optionally adding a boolean return value to the ripple event handlers) this issue could be easily mitigated.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz-starters-gbsh9b.stackblitz.io\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. click on any of the buttons\r\n2. see how the ripple get fired

Source inspection indicates that mat-tab-nav-bar does not use MAT_TABS_CONFIG for `stretchTabs` at all, unlike the tab-group.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/749enw?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftab-nav-bar-basic-example.ts\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nAdd the provider:\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\nprovide: MAT_TABS_CONFIG,\r\nuseValue: { stretchTabs: false },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `stretchTabs` from the provided config is applied\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `stretchTabs` from the provided config is not applied\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.0.3\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 113\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27211","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-tab-nav-bar): mat-tab-nav-bar does not use \"stretchTabs\" from the MAT_TABS_CONFIG\" (#27211)"},{"Id":"1735931017","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-01T09:58:20","Actor":"aanchal88","Number":"27210","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: use improved relative import path in button","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27210","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: use improved relative import path in button\" (#27210)"},{"Id":"1735496308","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-01T05:31:35","Actor":"patrick99e99","Number":"27209","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-select): adding content inside mat-select causes weird scroll jumping behavior when clicking on mat-options","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen scrollable content exists at the top of the pane of a mat-select, after scrolling down to get to the actual mat-options, when clicking these options, the scroll position of the pane jumps around and has extremely buggy and bizarre behavior.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this issue with a simple example:\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-14-material-uoxt1m?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhello.component.html\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nSimply click the select drop down and scroll down to the options and check some of them and you will notice that every time you click, the pane's scroll position jumps around...\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nthe scroll position should not change when clicking options.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nscroll position jumps around and is extremely weird and confusing.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.0\r\n- Browser(s):  Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): MacOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27209","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): adding content inside mat-select causes weird scroll jumping behavior when clicking on mat-options\" (#27209)"},{"Id":"1735276928","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-01T01:28:27","Actor":"amakhrov","Number":"27208","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(slider): Setting range slider value programmatically doesn't update the underlying DOM element","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat similar to an older issue with mat-checkbox (https://github.com/angular/components/issues/22149)\r\n\r\nI want to ensure that the range in the slider is always greater than zero.

It seemed appropriate to pull from the Material spec for these.  The use of \"Large body text\" and \"Medium body text\" is meant to help bridge the gap to the eventual shift to M3, since those type levels equate to [M3's Large and Medium body text](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/type-scale-tokens#d74b73c2-ac5d-43c5-93b3-088a2f67723d), respectively. \r\n\r\nI also tweaked the second table to give greater emphasis to the class names that match the typography levels when more than one class is mapped to a style.

In my case it's a **yarn monorepo**.\r\nA very similar issue has been described (but not fixed) in #34478. \r\n\r\nWhen loading a module (ts file) from a locally built monorepo package, it fails. But when exactly the same file is copied locally (no need to go through monorepo imports), all works fine (so there's no error in implementation). Finally, one has to override `paths` in tsconfig.json fixes the issue (importing from monorepo starts to work correctly).\r\n\r\n# How Angular behaves?\r\n\r\nlView is null, it shouldn't be. **Runtime fails entirely**.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"986\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/375027/026f454f-292b-43d9-84ed-ad1a5c14bb9c\">\r\n\r\n# Attempts to fix\r\n\r\nhere @arobinson described some potential ays to have it fixed, although, some of them just don't work (e.g. `preserveSymlinks` didn't help at all), while others are either already default (like `enableIvy`) or make no sense anymore (ngcc). None of them worked for me:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34478#issuecomment-567579719.\r\n\r\nWhat worked for me was exactly this: https://github.com/ducin/xstate/commit/b12cb0505d0c13070025cf1df118e6ed89270b7b#diff-ebc3d1841e5a32fba603bb62117cc4781a0746724fa35a05d013a5d56e31cbe3\r\n\r\nIt took me ~1 day 😢 to find what is the solution and found it accidentally. I did find the issue, however what I still find disrupting is:\r\n- there are no clear hints out there what might be wrong, e.g. I found no FAQ similar to this issue, no troubleshooting etc.\r\n- available links/issues/tips (coming from community) seem completely outdated\r\n\r\nIn ideal world, hopefully this gets fixed. if not, a warning message (when `npm link` usage found? not sure) would help a lot. If not, any hint would be useful.\r\n\r\n# Reproduce steps\r\n\r\nVery simple.

For instance, there is a community plugin for SignalStore that allows the connection with the Redux Devtools extension: https://github.com/angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#devtools-withdevtools\r\n\r\nThis plugin provides the ability to set the label that will be displayed in the devtools when patching the SignalStore state:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npatchState('set user', store, { user: 'Marko' });\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if we call `patchState` multiple times in the same tick:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npatchState('set user', store, { user: 'Marko' });\r\npatchState('reset query', store, { query: '' });\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly the last action will be logged in the devtools because Angular's effect will 'emit' only once.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way to solve this limitation / display multiple state changes that happen in the same tick.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCore APIs should be flexible enough to cover this scenario. For example in Vue, they provide three different types of the `watchEffect` function that is equivalent to `effect` in Angular:\r\n\r\n- `watchEffect`\r\n- `watchPostEffect`\r\n- `watchSyncEffect` <= Redux Devtools plugin needs this one\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to provide different flush timing to `watchEffect` function:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst count = ref(0)\r\n\r\nwatchEffect(() => console.log(count.value), { flush: 'sync' });\r\n// equivalent to:\r\nwatchSyncEffect(() => console.log(count.value));\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore info about Vue effects is available at the following link: https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#watcheffect\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to provide this functionality:\r\n\r\n1. Expose (internal) APIs that can be used by framework consumers to create watchers/custom effects that suit their needs.\r\n2. Provide the `syncEffect` function similar to `watchSyncEffect` from Vue.\r\n3. Provide the ability to pass the custom 'scheduler'/flush timing to the `effect` function:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst count = signal(0);\r\n\r\n// similar to Vue:\r\neffect(() => console.log(count()), { flush: 'sync' });\r\n// or more extensible solution:\r\neffect(() => console.log(count()), { scheduler: syncScheduler });\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCurrently, there is no way to achieve this behavior with existing public APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53703","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide the ability to synchronously track signal changes\" (#53703)"},{"Id":"2056638543","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-26T19:02:01","Actor":"jsaguet","Number":"53702","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow customization of HTTP Transfer Cache key","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncommon, platform-browser\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFollowing #50117, additional configuration was added to the HTTP transfer cache.\r\nOne use-case was mentioned in several replies and other issues about the lack of customization of the cache key but it was not handled in the associated PR so I'm opening a new issue, dedicated to this use case.\r\n\r\nWhen using SSR, it is common to use different urls on the server and the browser to access the same APIs.\r\nIt could be only the domain, the path or even the http scheme.\r\nThe main reason is to reduce network latency by accessing resources directly from a private network.\r\n\r\nWith the current HTTP transfer cache implementation, the cache key is computed from the `HttpRequest` with the [`makeCacheKey`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d315e2c4fa178dfbd41bc25259605bb999fa302e/packages/common/http/src/transfer_cache.ts#L183) function.\r\n\r\nThis function uses the request url among other things so when the url is different on the server and on the browser, the cached response will never be reused from the transfer cache during hydration.\r\n\r\nRelated comments / issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1602675046\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1648612777\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1732133906\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50117#issuecomment-1792077410\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/universal/issues/1934\r\n\r\n### Proposed solutions\r\n#### First solution: adding more options to HttpRequest and provideClientHydration()\r\nTo override the cache key at the request level, we can provide a custom cache key as a request option.\r\n```typescript\r\nconst customCacheKey = makeCustomCacheKey(url, params);\r\nthis.http.get(url, { transferCache: { cacheKey: customCacheKey } });\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo globally customize the cache key, we could either use an interceptor (Ability to override transferCache property when cloning the request is needed too)\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction customCacheKeyInterceptor = (req, next) => {\r\n    const newRequest = req.clone({ \r\n        transferCache: { \r\n            cacheKey: customCacheKey(req) // Custom logic possibly using DI to compute the cache key\r\n            ...req.transferCache,\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    return next(newRequest);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr we could add a \"custom cache key function\" option to `provideClientHydration()`:\r\n```typescript\r\nprovideClientHydration({\r\n    customCacheKeyFn: myCustomCacheKeyFn\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that providing a custom cache key function could simplify the usage of and totally replace the existing options `includeHeaders`, `filter` and `includePostRequests`. (but that would be breaking)\r\nThese options would probably need to be mutually exclusive because they could overlap.\r\n\r\nAnother useful thing would be to have access to the current `makeCacheKey` function so we could simply override some parts of the http request to customize the cache key:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { makeCacheKey } from '@angular/common/http';\r\n\r\nfunction customCacheKey(request: HttpRequest) {\r\n    // If only the url is different between server and browser, we can only override this part\r\n    const overridenRequest = request.clone({ url: 'urlToUseInCacheKey' });\r\n    return makeCacheKey(overridenRequest);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction customCacheKeyInterceptor = (req, next) => {\r\n    const newRequest = req.clone({ \r\n        transferCache: { \r\n            cacheKey: customCacheKey(request)\r\n            ...req.transferCache,\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    return next(newRequest);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n#### Second solution: expose `transferCacheInterceptorFn` and let developers use it where needed\r\nAnother way to solve this (closest to the original behavior with `TransferHttpCacheModule`) would be to expose the `transferCacheInterceptorFn` in the public API.\r\n\r\nWe could place this interceptor exactly where we need it in the interceptors chain to control what the request url looks like when cached.\r\n\r\nCaching would be enabled by using the interceptor function in `provideHttpClient()` and calling `provideClientHydration()`.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprovideHttpClient(\r\n    withInterceptors([\r\n        authInterceptorFn, // Add Auth header\r\n        transferCacheInterceptorFn, // Cache requests when they are still undifferentiated between browser & server\r\n        overrideUrlInterceptorFn, // Custom logic to override the url on server, specific to the user's use case\r\n])),\r\nprovideClientHydration(\r\n    withNoHttpTransferCache(), // disable injecting transferCacheInterceptorFn as the last interceptor\r\n    withHttpTransferCacheOptions({ includePostRequests: true }) // optionally provide global options for transferCacheInterceptorFn \r\n),\r\n```\r\nBecause the interceptor would still rely on `CACHE_OPTIONS` which is only provided by `provideClientHydration()`, we could make sure that the interceptor is used with `provideClientHydration()` and print a warning/error otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis approach would require minimal changes to the current implementation without adding any breaking change:\r\n- Always provide `CACHE_OPTIONS` even when using `withNoHttpTransferCache()`,\r\n- Provide `transferCacheInterceptorFn` as `HTTP_ROOT_INTERCEPTOR_FNS` only when `withNoHttpTransferCache()` is not used,\r\n- Remove the current error thrown when both `withNoHttpTransferCache()` and `withHttpTransferCacheOptions()` are used together.\r\n\r\n-------\r\nI believe that this second approach is the best one because it keeps a simple API for simple cases while giving the most flexibility for more advanced use cases. And all of that without any breaking change.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe only alternative is to disable transfer cache from provideClientHydration and rely on a custom caching logic based on an interceptor (like the old `TransferHttpCacheModule` from @angular/universal.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53702","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow customization of HTTP Transfer Cache key\" (#53702)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2060649007","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-30T06:12:28","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"26772","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@babel/core](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-core) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-core)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.23.6` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcore/7.23.6/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/core](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-core) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-core)) | devDependencies | patch | [`7.23.6` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcore/7.23.6/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/plugin-transform-async-generator-functions](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-transform-async-generator-functions) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-plugin-transform-async-generator-functions)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.23.4` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fplugin-transform-async-generator-functions/7.23.4/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/plugin-transform-async-generator-functions](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-transform-async-generator-functions) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-plugin-transform-async-generator-functions)) | devDependencies | patch | [`7.23.4` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fplugin-transform-async-generator-functions/7.23.4/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/plugin-transform-runtime](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-transform-runtime) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-plugin-transform-runtime)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.23.6` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fplugin-transform-runtime/7.23.6/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/plugin-transform-runtime](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-transform-runtime) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-plugin-transform-runtime)) | devDependencies | patch | [`7.23.6` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fplugin-transform-runtime/7.23.6/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/preset-env](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-preset-env) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-env)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.23.6` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fpreset-env/7.23.6/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/preset-env](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-preset-env) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-env)) | devDependencies | patch | [`7.23.6` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fpreset-env/7.23.6/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/runtime](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-runtime) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-runtime)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.23.6` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fruntime/7.23.6/7.23.7) |\n| [@babel/runtime](https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-runtime) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-runtime)) | devDependencies | patch | [`7.23.6` -> `7.23.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fruntime/7.23.6/7.23.7) |\n| [esbuild](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | optionalDependencies | patch | [`0.19.10` -> `0.19.11`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild/0.19.10/0.19.11) |\n| [esbuild](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | devDependencies | patch | [`0.19.10` -> `0.19.11`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild/0.19.10/0.19.11) |\n| [esbuild-wasm](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | dependencies | patch | [`0.19.10` -> `0.19.11`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild-wasm/0.19.10/0.19.11) |\n| [esbuild-wasm](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild) | devDependencies | patch | [`0.19.10` -> `0.19.11`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/esbuild-wasm/0.19.10/0.19.11) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel (@&#8203;babel/core)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.23.7`](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v7237-2023-12-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.23.6...v7.23.7)\n\n##### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n-   `babel-traverse`\n    -

The rationale was that in this case, all class instance fields are omitted in the output so no changes to the constructor are needed. However, if all of this is the case *and* there are `#private` instance fields with initializers, those private instance field initializers were still being moved into the constructor. This was problematic because they were being inserted before the call to `super()` (since `super()` is now no longer transformed in that case). This release introduces an additional optimization that avoids moving the private instance field initializers into the constructor in this edge case, which generates smaller code, matches the TypeScript compiler's output more closely, and avoids this bug:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #private = 1;\n      public: any;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with esbuild v0.19.9)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.#private = 1;\n      }\n      #private;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with esbuild v0.19.10)\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        this.#private = 1;\n        super();\n      }\n      #private;\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #private = 1;\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Minifier: allow reording a primitive past a side-effect ([#&#8203;3568](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3568))\n\n    The minifier previously allowed reordering a side-effect past a primitive, but didn't handle the case of reordering a primitive past a side-effect. This additional case is now handled:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    function f() {\n      let x = false;\n      let y = x;\n      const boolean = y;\n      let frag = $.template(`<p contenteditable=\"${boolean}\">hello world</p>`);\n      return frag;\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    function f(){const e=!1;return $.template(`<p contenteditable=\"${e}\">hello world</p>`)}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    function f(){return $.template('<p contenteditable=\"false\">hello world</p>')}\n    ```\n\n-   Minifier: consider properties named using known `Symbol` instances to be side-effect free ([#&#8203;3561](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3561))\n\n    Many things in JavaScript can have side effects including property accesses and ToString operations, so using a symbol such as `Symbol.iterator` as a computed property name is not obviously side-effect free. This release adds a special case for known `Symbol` instances so that they are considered side-effect free when used as property names. For example, this class declaration will now be considered side-effect free:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Provide the `stop()` API in node to exit esbuild's child process ([#&#8203;3558](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3558))\n\n    You can now call `stop()` in esbuild's node API to exit esbuild's child process to reclaim the resources used. It only makes sense to do this for a long-lived node process when you know you will no longer be making any more esbuild API calls. It is not necessary to call this to allow node to exit, and it's advantageous to not call this in between calls to esbuild's API as sharing a single long-lived esbuild child process is more efficient than re-creating a new esbuild child process for every API call. This API call used to exist but was removed in [version 0.9.0](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.9.0). This release adds it back due to a user request.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

My goal is to dynamically fetch specific theme configurations based on the individual hostnames.\r\n\r\nProblem Description:\r\n\r\n**Scenario**: I have multiple Firebase hostings (e.g., test1.com, test2.com) linked to a single Firebase project. Each domain should have its own theme configuration fetched from a database on the server.\r\n\r\n**Approaches Tried**: I attempted to access the hostname using methods such as `@Inject(DOCUMENT)` for the **Document** and **PlatformLocation**, but these only work on the client side.\r\n\r\n**Server-side Code**: In the server-side code (server.ts), I added Injection Tokens within the Angular SSR's commonEngine.render() method to provide request-related data, but the retrieved data remains NULL in the component.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular SSR application with Firebase Hosting connected to multiple domains. (Although it is not required*)\r\n\r\nIn the app component page use HttpClient to get a domain theme (or any info)\r\n\r\n```\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private linkService: LinkService,\r\n

server the application\r\n`\"serve:ssr\": \"npm run build:dev && node dist/{APP_NAME}/server/server.mjs\",`\r\n\r\nTry to run `curl {host}` it's a blank page which means there was not any SSR process

In addition, as pointed out in issue #25791, I had to edit the `main.c36c93e7c9c8f569.js` file to change the path to the resources in the assets file to be consistent with that generated by the build.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Angular 17, I am no longer able to build the file such that it runs locally without modification of the angular.json file.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate an Angular 17 project\r\nrun \r\n`ng build --base-href HubView --omit-dev`\r\nand edit the index.html file as instructed above. \r\nClick on the generated file - it will not run\r\n\r\nIf I modify the angular.json file as follows\r\n```\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"outputPath\": \"dist/hub-view-v5-17\",\r\n            \"index\": \"src/index.html\",\r\n            \"main\": \"src/main.ts\",\r\n```\r\nthe above technique works.

This code breaks with the final project structure, because there the app config is in a separate file instead of an object literal.\r\n\r\nThese changes update the utilities to account for the new structure. Note the updates are meant to cover the majority of apps and there are likely some edge cases that aren't covered. Covering all cases is tricky with the current setup, because to do so correctly would require knowledge of the entire app whereas the utilities operate on a file-by-file basis. For example, now the code is able to update a config in a separate file, but it wouldn't be able to handle a config that is re-exported. For such a case to be supported, we would need access to the type checker. These edge cases will be addressed later on with a larger refactor of the schematics utilities.\r\n\r\nI've added a couple of extra utilities for inserting function calls into the `providers` array and checking if a function is called in the `providers` array.

Scrolling up (and up only) is causing the viewport content to disappear and reappear in a glitchy manner. This glitch only happens after scrolling to the BOTTOM of the content after resizing the viewport (or window if it snaps to it), and it persists until the user scrolls to the exact TOP of the viewport. After you scroll completely to the top (with the workaround implemented), the glitchy behavior stops, you can scroll up and down, even to the bottom, and it will work, until the viewport width is resized again, and then the glitch reappears.\r\n- The workaround-glitch does not start happening (nor the one without the workaround) until you actually scroll to the bottom. if you just scroll to the middle, etc, and then up, it behaves normally.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the workaround is not enough and results in horrible UX, especially with large datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Snippets:**\r\n\r\nTemplate:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport\r\n    #accordionVirtualScroller\r\n    autosize\r\n    [style.height]=\"isOutermostInstance ? '100%' : '500px'\"\r\n    (scroll)=\"checkViewportStuff($event)\"\r\n>\r\n    ... rendered a bunch of closed accordions etc ...\r\n</...>\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent:\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncheckViewportStuff($event: Event): void {\r\n    console.log('well, we scrolled');\r\n    const accordionWrapper = this.accordionVirtualScroller.elementRef.nativeElement;\r\n    const contentWrapper = accordionWrapper.querySelector('.cdk-virtual-scroll-content-wrapper') as HTMLElement;\r\n    if (!contentWrapper) return;\r\n\r\n    const transformStyle = contentWrapper.style.transform;\r\n\r\n    const translateYMatch = transformStyle.match(/translateY\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\r\n    if (translateYMatch && translateYMatch[1]) {\r\n        const translateY = parseFloat(translateYMatch[1]);\r\n        if (translateY < 0) {\r\n            console.log('OUT OF BOUNDS');\r\n            setTimeout(() => {\r\n                this.renderer.setStyle(contentWrapper, 'transform', 'translateY(0px)');\r\n                accordionWrapper.scrollTop = 0;\r\n            }, 100);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Implement the CDK virtual scroller with autosize enabled.\r\n2. Resize the viewport width to change the width of the virtual scroller.\r\n3. Scroll to the bottom of the content.\r\n4. Attempt to scroll back up.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n- Smooth scrolling without any visual glitches\r\n- No out-of-bound translateY values.\r\n- Correct scroll direction.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n- When scrolling back up from the bottom after resizing the viewport width, the translateY CSS property becomes negative and keeps getting lower and lower, causing the viewport content to disappear.\r\n- The viewport does not differentiate between the scroll wheel direction, it just keeps pushing the translateY further into an invalid value.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- **Angular:** 15.1.4, 15.2.5 (both versions tested, updated to see if it helps)\r\n- **CDK:** 15.1.4, 15.2.5 \r\n- **CDK-Experimental:** 15.1.4, 15.2.5 \r\n- **Browser(s):** Brave v1.49.132 (Chromium), Mozilla 111.0.1 (64-bit), likely all other browsers?\r\n- **Operating System:**: Windows 10 Enterprise 21H2\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26882","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CDK Virtual Scroller (Experimental) Glitch after viewport width resize (or zoom in/out) and scrolling to the Bottom\" (#26882)"},{"Id":"1647819021","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-04T10:38:41","Actor":"jonathan-meier","Number":"26864","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/core): typography-level overrides certain font properties that can not be defined via typography config","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe `typography-level` mixin uses the `font` shorthand CSS property to define fonts. However, this shorthand property overrides font properties with default values that can't be configured via the typography config.

The second `h1` element in the example component is styled with a custom class `mat-h1-custom` defined in `styles.scss` exactly the same way as `mat-h1` does but without using the `font` shorthand.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBoth elements should inherit the `font-variant-caps: small-caps;` style defined in rule for `body` in `style.scss`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly the second element applies the `font-variant-caps: small-caps;` style, while for the first element the `font-variant-caps` is overridden by the `font` shorthand property used in the style rule for `mat-h1`. Note that it is not possible to specify the value for the `font-variant-caps` property in the typography config such that it would be applied to the `mat-h1` rule.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.2.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.2.5\r\n- Browser(s): all\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): all\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26864","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(material/core): typography-level overrides certain font properties that can not be defined via typography config\" (#26864)"},{"Id":"1647831046","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-04T10:38:39","Actor":"jonathan-meier","Number":"26865","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): don't use font shorthand property in typography-level","State":"closed","Body":"This avoids overriding font properties with default values that can't be configured in the current typography config, e.g. the font-variant-caps or font-feature-settings property.\r\n\r\nFixes #26864","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26865","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/core): don't use font shorthand property in typography-level\" (#26865)"},{"Id":"1653584281","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-04T10:10:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26881","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/tabs): switch to tokens API","State":"open","Body":"Switches the tabs to use the new tokens API.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26881","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/tabs): switch to tokens API\" (#26881)"},{"Id":"1653102883","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-04T03:18:44","Actor":"zarend","Number":"26880","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(slide-toggle): DOM order does not match visual order when slide toggle has `labelPosition=\"before\"`","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nDOM order does not match visual order when slide toggle has `labelPosition=\"before\"`\n\n### Reproduction\n\n  ```\r\n  \r\n          <mat-slide-toggle\r\n            labelPosition=\"before\"\r\n          >Activate</mat-slide-toggle>\r\n          \r\n         ```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDOM order matches visual order\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nlabel comes after the button in the DOM.

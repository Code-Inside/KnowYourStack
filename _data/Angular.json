Create new project `ng new serve-import-bug` with default settings\r\n1. Launch the angular server with `ng serve`\r\n1. Add a new module in app.module.ts, for example `FormsModule`\r\n1.

Correct is `\"../dist\"` (two dots). Running `ng build` created a huge mess. In the app root a folder has been created with `...` as name (ending a folder name in Windows with a dot is illegal). Inside of this three dot folder all of my project files were listed (including `node_modules` folder). There was also a folder named `...`, which again contained my whole project files. This recursively went to whatever level (I clicked throuhg the folder approximately 30 levels down, there was still a `...` folder). Deleting the first `...` folder lastet more than 15 minutes, then telling me the files which should be deleted aren't there anymore. Also my project files in the root directory were deleted in this process (luckily most of it in Git). That was the strangest thing, it felt like the content inside of `...` mirrored my root project somehow (like in https://superuser.com/questions/528502/cant-remove-three-dots-folder-on-my-hdd). I also tried reverting my files using Git which did not work at all. I managed to delete the whole repository locally with `rm -rf 'folder'` using the GitBash. After cloning the project again, my IDE (Webstorm) listed the `...` folder once again, which luckily could be deleted this time. The project looks fine right now, and with the correct `outputPath` the app builds correctly.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the CLI checks pathnames for illegal characters. I did not try any other illegal characters inside of the path name.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCaution: Try in a sandbox environment with unimported files only to prevent loss of data!\r\n\r\n1. Change the `\"outputPath\"` in `angular.json` to `\".../dist\"` (three dots)\r\n2.

Using a mat-form-field with mat-chip-list and an input.\r\n2.  Declare the [matChipInputSeparatorKeyCodes]=\"separatorKeysCodes\", with separatorKeysCodes: number[] = [ENTER, COMMA, SEMICOLON, 188];\r\n3. Use a \";\" in the input to trigger the chipEnd event. But i won't trigger. Neither by pressing the semicolon (EU Keyboard keys: shift + ,\")\r\n4. The input wont trigger the chipEnd after pasting text into the input and doesnt check for the separatorKeys in the pasted text.\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe chipEnd event should be triggered after typing the Semicolon into to the input.\r\nAlso should pasted text be regnozed and processed based on the declared separatorKeys. \r\nFor example:\r\nseparatorKeys [COMMA]\r\nPasted text: \"name1, name2, name3\"\r\nAfter pasting chipEnd event triggers and created 3 chips: \"name1\", \"name2\", \"name3\"\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nSemicolon doesn't trigger any event and will just display in the input.\r\nPasted text also doesn't trigger any event and will just display in the input.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 11.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 11.0.0\r\n-

These changes are split up into 3 commits to make them easier to review:\r\n\r\n1. Has all the changes necessary for the migration itself, including:\r\n* The migration script itself which is intended to be a one-off script, but I'm including it here so we can review the steps that I used to do the migration. I can remove it, if we don't think it's useful.\r\n* Some adjustments to the MDC form field theme which the migrator had a hard time dealing with.\r\n* A workaround in the `core/theming/_theming.scss` file which will be reverted in the third commit, after the migration is finished. This is another case the automated migrator was struggling with.\r\n* Using Sass modules to create the theming bundle and removing the dependency on `scss-bundle`.\r\n* Fixing a transient dependency on `@types/sass`. This used to come from `scss-bundle`, but we need it explicitly after the dependency was removed.\r\n2. The actual migration. All changes in this commit have been made by the migration script.\r\n3. Post-migration cleanup, including:\r\n* Removing the workaround from `core/theming/_theming.scss` in the first commit.\r\n* Manually fixing all of the Stylelint failures that couldn't be fixed automatically.\r\n* Updating one of our custom lint rules to account for the new syntax.\r\n\r\nNote that these changes didn't migrate our imports from `@material/*`, because the migration script doesn't work with styles coming from the `node_modules`. It supports imports starting with `~`, but they only work for the first level and break down if there's another absolute import within the package. I will make another manual pass over the remaining `@import` usages once these changes have landed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21208","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material/core): migrate to the Sass module system #21204\" (#21208)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-12-07T05:30:05.0417667Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2783}

I like the proposal of @ShacharHarshuv https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51786, and it provides some good ideas about a simplistic API aligned to signals. However, there are still many things to consider (custom control values that are non-primitives and can cause confusion with groups (TValue first vs TControl first discussion in Typed forms discussion).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it would be great to have some updates to the existing form modules that would allow us to work with signal-based state when handling forms. Also, it would be great to expose any form-based state as reactive values contrary to the sometimes limited `valueChanges` and `statusChanges`. This would allow the combination of form state using `computed` and the execution of side-effects using `effect` to fulfil many form handling use cases.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to include signals for all relevant form states within `AbstractControl` and update them whenever the local state of the form controls gets updated. This way, developers can benefit from the new reactive form state in both reactive and template-driven forms since NgForm / NgModel uses `AbstractControl` under the hood. This is a feasible and non-intrusive alternative before a possible rewrite of the Form Module.\r\n\r\nWithin this proposal, the signals of `AbstractControl` that represent the form controls state are grouped within a new `signals` object inside `AbstractControl`. This allows the regular form state and signals to coexist without causing name clashes or overcomplicated lengthy prefixes. This also encourages the extraction of specific signals using destructuring `const {value, valid} = myControl.signals;`.\r\n\r\nFor template-driven forms using `NgForm` and `NgModel`, the current idea is to provide a way to inject your signals from your component into the controls using `ngFormOptions` and `ngModelOptions`. Since the developer does not have control over the form control creation in template-driven forms, that's the simplest way to connect forms created within the template to some signals within your component. An alternative idea would be to obtain the `NgModel` directive within the component using `ViewChild` and then receive the signals from the exposed control. However, that would require you to wait for `AfterViewInit` or even `AfterViewChecked`, and this would compromise the declarative approach, which is possible by passing manually created signals into the controls.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-capacity',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [ReactiveFormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <p>Reservations: {{reservations()}}</p>\r\n    <p>Capacity: <input type=\"number\" [formControl]=\"capacity\" /></p>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class CapacityComponent {\r\n  capacity = new FormControl(5, {nonNullable: true});\r\n  reservations = signal(0);\r\n  interval = setInterval(() => this.reservations.update(count => count + 1), 1000);\r\n  hasCapacity = computed(() => this.capacity.signals.value() > this.reservations());\r\n  capacityEffect = effect(() => console.log(this.hasCapacity() ? 'We have some capacity!' : 'No capacity!'));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis simple example with reactive forms shows that even when `FormControl` does not natively use signals, we still benefit from the newly exposed signals object and can create larger reactive constructs quite declaratively.\r\n\r\nWith template-driven forms, we can achieve similar reactive handling by using the `ngFormOptions` and `ngModelOptions` directive inputs.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-simple-template',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [FormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <input type=\"text\" reqired ngModel [ngModelOptions]=\"{signals: {value: searchQuery}}\" />\r\n    <div>Results: {{results()}}</div>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class SimpleTemplateComponent {\r\n  searchService = inject(SearchService);\r\n  searchQuery = signal('');\r\n  results = signal([] as string[]);\r\n  searchEffect = effect(async () => {\r\n    if (this.searchQuery().length > 3) {\r\n      this.results.set(await lastValueFrom(this.searchService.search(this.searchQuery())));\r\n    }\r\n  }, {allowSignalWrites: true})\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr a little more complex template-driven form:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-template-driven-form-signals-option',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [FormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <form #form=\"ngForm\" [ngFormOptions]=\"{signals: formSignals}\">\r\n      <label>\r\n        First Name:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" required name=\"firstName\"\r\n               ngModel [ngModelOptions]=\"{signals: firstNameSignals}\"\r\n               [style.border]=\"firstNameInvalid() ? '1px solid red' : undefined\"/>\r\n      </label>\r\n      <label>\r\n        Last Name:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" ngModel/>\r\n      </label>\r\n\r\n      <p>Full name: {{ fullName() }}</p>\r\n      @if (showErrors()) {\r\n        <p>Form contains errors</p>\r\n      }\r\n    </form>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class TemplateDrivenFormSignalsOptionComponent {\r\n  formSignals = {\r\n    invalid: signal(false),\r\n    dirty: signal(false),\r\n    value: signal({ firstName: '', lastName: '' })\r\n  } satisfies Partial<AbstractControlSignals<{firstName: string; lastName: string}>>;\r\n\r\n  firstNameSignals = {\r\n    invalid: signal(false),\r\n    dirty: signal(false),\r\n  } satisfies Partial<AbstractControlSignals<string>>;\r\n\r\n  fullName = computed(\r\n    () => `${this.formSignals.value().firstName} ${this.formSignals.value().lastName}`\r\n  );\r\n  showErrors = computed(\r\n    () => this.formSignals.invalid() && this.formSignals.dirty()\r\n  );\r\n  firstNameInvalid = computed(() => this.firstNameSignals.invalid() && this.firstNameSignals.dirty());\r\n  logFullname = effect(() => {\r\n    console.log(`Full name: ${this.fullName()}`);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've created a draft PR with the changes required for this new feature.

That means if signal has changed, it will automatically mark component for check. But if you detach component from change detection it is pointless and it does nothing and signals does not provide any advantage over regular value properties.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is not directly connected to signals but to 'tracking context' which watches for changes of signals in component template. If so maybe it should be another configuration property for `@Component` which will allow to change what change detectors method should be used.\r\n\r\nAbout immediately running DetectChanges after change of single signal is not right way, because there can be many singnals changed during one change detection cycle, but there could be solution in configuring how to run it, whether at the end of change detection or immediately.\r\n\r\nThis would add another benefit to signals :)\r\n\r\nThank you for consideration of this.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nProposed solution was mention above.\r\n\r\nSome way of configuring this for component or signal itself.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nOnly alternative now is explicitly call DetectChanges, which means you dont have to use 'signal' for it and just use regular value property.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53484","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FEATURE: configurable signals change detection method\" (#53484)"},{"Id":"2034467244","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-10T17:45:23","Actor":"kukjevov","Number":"53483","RawContent":null,"Title":"BUG: syntax coloring for new block syntax, not working with Allman formatting","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nlanguage-service\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nFollowing syntax is not colored correctly\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if(cond)\r\n{\r\n}\r\n@else\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nalso for \r\n```\r\n@for(x of xxx; track x)\r\n{\r\n}\r\n@empty\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst block is colored that is ok, but second block is always as plain white text.\r\n\r\nThis is regression, because first version of new block syntax coloring (last beta or first rc, dont remember exactly) was working correctly.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Angular forms don't support signals natively. Although through AbstractFormControl, valueChanges and statusChanges can be used together with reactive helpers to extract signals, there are certain drawbacks with this approach:\r\n- No native feel\r\n- Boilerplate to convert observables to signals\r\n- Reactivity was always only partially provided with reactive forms (only values and status changes, not raw values and control state changes like pristine, touched, etc.)\r\n- Provided the simplicity of the new reactive primitives, it's highly desirable to add a template-driven simple form approach that is backed up with a powerful but straightforward reactive concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n- Form controls expose additional signals for each relevant control state, grouped by a new `signals` property on the control objects.\r\n- By default, signals are created internally and can be accessed through the control object `control.signals.value()`. This allows a side-by-side existence with the previous regular form state handling.\r\n- In ngForm / ngModel based forms, we can't govern the form control creation. Therefore, a different approach was used to pass a new optional signals option to ngFormOptions and ngModelOptions. Using that approach, developers can create their signals in the component and pass them to the template-driven form directives, where they will be added to the respective controls.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n## Signal-based forms (template-driven forms with signals for reactivity)\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { Component, computed, effect, signal } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { AbstractControlSignals, FormsModule } from 'angular-signal-forms';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-signal-based-form',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <h1>Simple template driven signal-based form</h1>\r\n    <form #form=\"ngForm\" [ngFormOptions]=\"{signals}\">\r\n      <label>\r\n        First Name:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" required name=\"firstName\" ngModel/>\r\n      </label>\r\n      <label>\r\n        Last Name:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" ngModel/>\r\n      </label>\r\n\r\n      <p>Full name: {{ fullName() }}</p>\r\n      @if (showErrors()) {\r\n        <p>Form contains errors</p>\r\n      }\r\n    </form>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class SignalBasedFormComponent {\r\n  signals = {\r\n    invalid: signal(false),\r\n    dirty: signal(false),\r\n    value: signal({ firstName: '', lastName: '' })\r\n  } satisfies Partial<AbstractControlSignals<{firstName: string; lastName: string}>>;\r\n  fullName = computed(\r\n    () => `${this.signals.value().firstName} ${this.signals.value().lastName}`\r\n  );\r\n  showErrors = computed(\r\n    () => this.signals.invalid() && this.signals.dirty()\r\n  );\r\n  logFullname = effect(() => {\r\n    console.log(`Full name: ${this.fullName()}`);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can check out this Stackblitz with the updated Angular Forms package:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-uyjg2x?file=src%2Freactive-form.component.ts,src%2Ftemplate-driven-form-signals-option.component.ts,src%2Ftemplate-driven-form.component.ts,src%2Fsignal-based-forms.component.ts\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your feedback on this idea / proposal.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nGion\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53481","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): WIP / Proposal, signals in reactive and template driven forms\" (#53481)"},{"Id":"2034281765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-10T09:03:34","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"53478","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template Pipeline: Various Host Bindings fixes","State":"open","Body":"WIP","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53478","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Template Pipeline: Various Host Bindings fixes\" (#53478)"},{"Id":"2034211496","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-10T04:12:19","Actor":"johnnygerard","Number":"53476","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(benchpress): fix typo","State":"open","Body":"\"stop watch\" should be \"stopwatch\"\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n- [x] The commit message follows [our guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53476","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(benchpress): fix typo\" (#53476)"},{"Id":"2034126246","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-09T22:55:26","Actor":"clydin","Number":"53475","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove unused TypeScript type definition packages","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

You can now control the color space that the interpolation happens in as well as (for \"polar\" color spaces) control whether hue angle interpolation happens clockwise or counterclockwise. You can read more about this in [Mozilla's blog post about new CSS gradient features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/css-color-module-level-4/).\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now automatically transform this syntax for older browsers in the `target` list. For example, here's a gradient that should appear as a rainbow in a browser that supports this new syntax:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .rainbow-gradient {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background: linear-gradient(in hsl longer hue, #&#8203;7ff, #&#8203;77f);\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome99) */\n    .rainbow-gradient {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background:\n        linear-gradient(\n          #&#8203;77ffff,\n          #&#8203;77ffaa 12.5%,\n          #&#8203;77ff80 18.75%,\n          #&#8203;84ff77 21.88%,\n          #&#8203;99ff77 25%,\n          #eeff77 37.5%,\n          #fffb77 40.62%,\n          #ffe577 43.75%,\n          #ffbb77 50%,\n          #ff9077 56.25%,\n          #ff7b77 59.38%,\n          #ff7788 62.5%,\n          #ff77dd 75%,\n          #ff77f2 78.12%,\n          #f777ff 81.25%,\n          #cc77ff 87.5%,\n          #&#8203;7777ff);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can now use this syntax in your CSS source code and esbuild will automatically convert it to an equivalent gradient for older browsers. In addition, esbuild will now also transform \"double position\" and \"transition hint\" syntax for older browsers as appropriate:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    .stripes {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background: linear-gradient(#e65 33%, #ff2 33% 67%, #&#8203;99e 67%);\n    }\n    .glow {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background: radial-gradient(white 10%, 20%, black);\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome33) */\n    .stripes {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background:\n        linear-gradient(\n          #e65 33%,\n          #ff2 33%,\n          #ff2 67%,\n          #&#8203;99e 67%);\n    }\n    .glow {\n      width: 100px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background:\n        radial-gradient(\n          #ffffff 10%,\n          #aaaaaa 12.81%,\n          #&#8203;959595 15.62%,\n          #&#8203;7b7b7b 21.25%,\n          #&#8203;5a5a5a 32.5%,\n          #&#8203;444444 43.75%,\n          #&#8203;323232 55%,\n          #&#8203;161616 77.5%,\n          #&#8203;000000);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can see visual examples of these new syntax features by looking at [esbuild's gradient transformation tests](https://esbuild.github.io/gradient-tests/).\n\n    If necessary, esbuild will construct a new gradient that approximates the original gradient by recursively splitting the interval in between color stops until the approximation error is within a small threshold. That is why the above output CSS contains many more color stops than the input CSS.\n\n    Note that esbuild deliberately *replaces* the original gradient with the approximation instead of inserting the approximation before the original gradient as a fallback. The latest version of Firefox has multiple gradient rendering bugs (including incorrect interpolation of partially-transparent colors and interpolating non-sRGB colors using the incorrect color space). If esbuild didn't replace the original gradient, then Firefox would use the original gradient instead of the fallback the appearance would be incorrect in Firefox. In other words, the latest version of Firefox supports modern gradient syntax but interprets it incorrectly.\n\n-   Add support for `color()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, `oklch()`, and `hwb()` in CSS\n\n    CSS has recently added lots of new ways of specifying colors. You can read more about this in [Chrome's blog post about CSS color spaces](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide).\n\n    This release adds support for minifying colors that use the `color()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, `oklch()`, or `hwb()` syntax and/or transforming these colors for browsers that don't support it yet:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    div {\n      color: hwb(90deg 20% 40%);\n      background: color(display-p3 1 0 0);\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome99) */\n    div {\n      color: #&#8203;669933;\n      background: #ff0f0e;\n      background: color(display-p3 1 0 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    As you can see, colors outside of the sRGB color space such as `color(display-p3 1 0 0)` are mapped back into the sRGB gamut and inserted as a fallback for browsers that don't support the new color syntax.\n\n-   Allow empty type parameter lists in certain cases ([#&#8203;3512](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3512))\n\n    TypeScript allows interface declarations and type aliases to have empty type parameter lists. Previously esbuild didn't handle this edge case but with this release, esbuild will now parse this syntax:\n\n    ```ts\n    interface Foo<> {}\n    type Bar<> = {}\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Inspect memory usage.\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-demo',\r\n  templateUrl: './demo.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./demo.component.scss'],\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [MatButtonModule, CommonModule],\r\n})\r\nexport class DemoComponent {\r\n  public shown = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button mat-button *ngIf=\"shown\" (click)=\"shown = false\">Demo shown</button>\r\n<button mat-button *ngIf=\"!shown\" (click)=\"shown = true\">Demo not shown</button>\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n Buttons are garbage collected.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nButtons are not garbage collected.\r\nAt startup:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/69304231/e04682a2-b950-4295-9fa6-de9bfcbef046)\r\nAfter multiple clicks:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/69304231/7c53fa8b-608f-41d4-8b29-67468931ba85)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:16.2.0\r\n- CDK/Material:16.2.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome Version 119.0.6045.200 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28241","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatButton): MatButton leaking memory when removed from DOM with ngIf\" (#28241)"},{"Id":"2032403253","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-08T10:35:03","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28249","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(material/form-field): tokenize density overrides","State":"open","Body":"Switches the custom density implementation of the form field to be based on tokens.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28249","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(material/form-field): tokenize density overrides\" (#28249)"},{"Id":"2031612945","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T22:30:15","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"28248","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.1.0-next.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28248","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.1.0-next.2\" with changelog.\" (#28248)"},{"Id":"2031599250","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T22:03:18","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"28247","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.0.3 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28247","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.0.3 release\" (#28247)"},{"Id":"2031591306","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T21:58:52","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"28246","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.0.3\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28246","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.0.3\" with changelog.\" (#28246)"},{"Id":"2031555043","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T21:26:05","Actor":"benclarkdev","Number":"28245","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(Customizing Typography): Input?","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nIt seems that `input` was deprecated as a typography level in v15, but in \"Customizing Typography\" for v15-current, we have:\r\n\r\n> The button and input typography levels do not map to CSS classes.\r\n\r\nIt seems like that is an oversight?\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nguide/typography","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28245","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(Customizing Typography): Input?\" (#28245)"},{"Id":"2031430844","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T19:58:21","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"28244","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tabs): add header divider for m3","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28244","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/tabs): add header divider for m3\" (#28244)"},{"Id":"2030989447","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T15:24:09","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28243","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): fix internal focus state on safari","State":"open","Body":"* Fixes https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28211","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28243","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): fix internal focus state on safari\" (#28243)"},{"Id":"2030448921","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-07T10:39:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28242","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/button): add the ability to interact with disabled buttons","State":"open","Body":"Native disabled buttons don't allow focus and prevent the button from dispatching events.

Repeat step 1 to 3 while observing JS event listener count in Chrome performance monitor, run garbage collector manually\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nJS event listener and DOM node count returns to its initial value after garbage collection.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nJS event listener and DOM node count increases every time a new button is clicked, even if we remove them with ngIf.

Most of the tabs are detached and reattached until the tab is closed.\r\n\r\nThe active tab is determined from the currently active route on each navigation end event. This way if the application is loaded with a specific url, the appropriate tab is selected.\r\n\r\nConsider the following routes:\r\n```\r\n- /tab1\r\n- /tab2\r\n- /tab2/sub1\r\n- /tab2/sub2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the `/tab2` route, another tab group is present with links to the sub routes (and of course a sub router-outlet as well).\r\n\r\nIf we load the app with the `/tabs2/sub2` route, the components of `/tab2` and `/tab2/sub2` are loaded, which also means that the tab2's ink is initialized to the second tab in the header.\r\n\r\nNow, if we navigate to `/tab1`, these components are not destroyed, however the tab link active flags are set to false because neither `/tab2/sub1` nor `/tab2/sub2` is active after the navigation ends.\r\n\r\nThen if we navigate back to `/tab2/sub2`, the components are not reinitialized (because of the reuse strategy). but the active flag is changed for the `/tab2/sub2` tab link (because it is now active after navigation end).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-nckgfk?file=src%2Ftab-active-tracker.directive.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Click on Tab 1 -> Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n2. Click on Tab 2 -> Tab 2 highlighted [OK], inner tab group loaded [OK]\r\n3. Click on Sub-Tab 1 -> upper Sub-Tab 1 highlighted [OK], inner Sub-Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n4. Click on Sub-Tab 2 -> upper Sub-Tab 2 highlighted [OK], inner Sub-Tab 2 highlighted [OK]\r\n5. Click on Tab 1 -> Tab 1 highlighted [OK]\r\n6. Click on Sub-Tab 2 -> Tab 2 highlighted [OK], **inner Sub 2 is NOT highlighted [NOK]**\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAfter the step 6 the ink should be re-initialized even if set to the same value.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the active status is properly set (font is bold on the inner Sub-Tab 2 header element) but the ink is missing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think I found the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nWhen we navigate from the `/tab2/sub2` back to `/tab1`, neither the `/tab2/sub1` nor the `/tab2/sub2` routes are active so the `selectedIndex` is set to `-1` and the ink's `hide()` is called. However, the index just set is not processed until the next `ngAfterContentChecked` call.\r\n\r\nNow, when we navigate back to `/tab2/sub2` (which was the last active inner tab) the ink handler thinks that despite the selection index is changed (from `-1` ro `1`), the selection itself is not changed.\r\n\r\nI think that in the `hide()` function of `MatInkBar` the `this._currentItem` should be set to `null`. Because next time when `alignToElement` is called, the `correspondingItem === currentItem` check will be true (but the index was changed from `1 -> -1 -> 1` but it was not processed due to a missing `ngAfterContentChecked` call)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/0762d69b394343555488b5aaada9444dd1a5083a/src/material/tabs/ink-bar.ts#L40\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 17.0.5\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.8.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.5\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.2\r\n@angular/material               17.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28229","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatTabLink): Underline (MatTabInk) is missing if combined with route reuse strategy\" (#28229)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-12-11T03:30:02.3495067Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1473}

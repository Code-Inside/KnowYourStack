When placing debugger statements in our code the browser just points at the end of the component template. This is not a problem when AOT is enabled.\n\nI noticed after some debugging that disabling the Angular CLI cache resolves the problem. Running `ng cache clean` or removing the `.angular` directory and restarting the dev server (with caching) does not help. Caching needs to be completely disabled for sourcemaps to work.\n\n**Caching enabled:**\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df9a33b4-d0d1-4347-aa7e-7ad47a3ec0a2\" />\n\n\n**Caching disabled:**\n\n<img width=\"294\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/126bbea4-0318-4a96-95fa-c790d8a3df73\" />\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/urrang/ng19-sourcemap-repro\n\nCommand: `ng serve`\n\nThe repro app has a debugger statement in the button's click handler. On the main branch the problem should be reproducible. On the cache-disabled branch CLI's cache has been disabled and the debugger should work as expected.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.8\nNode: 22.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.1.7\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1901.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/core            19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.1.8\n@angular/cli                    19.1.8\n@schematics/angular             19.1.8\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29697","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing component sourcemaps with JIT and CLI cache enabled\" (#29697)"},{"Id":"2870535922","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-23T14:40:53","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29693","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency rxjs to v7.8.2","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [rxjs](https://rxjs.dev) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/reactivex/rxjs)) | dependencies | patch | [`7.8.1` -> `7.8.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rxjs/7.8.1/7.8.2) |\n| [rxjs](https://rxjs.dev) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/reactivex/rxjs)) | devDependencies | patch | [`7.8.1` -> `7.8.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rxjs/7.8.1/7.8.2) |\n\n---\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Some dependencies could not be looked up.

It works fine when built for production, however. \n\nHere's my `server.ts` file:\n\n```\nimport { AngularNodeAppEngine, createNodeRequestHandler, isMainModule, writeResponseToNodeResponse } from '@angular/ssr/node';\nimport express from 'express';\nimport { dirname, resolve } from 'node:path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';\nimport { RedirectError } from './app/core/errors/redirect.error';\n\nconst serverDistFolder = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\nconst browserDistFolder = resolve(serverDistFolder, '../browser');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst angularApp = new AngularNodeAppEngine();\n\napp.use(\n\texpress.static(browserDistFolder, {\n\t\tmaxAge: '1y',\n\t\tindex: false,\n\t\tredirect: false,\n\t})\n);\n\napp.use('/**', (req, res, next) => {\n\tangularApp\n\t\t.handle(req)\n\t\t.then((response) => (response ? writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res) : next()))\n\t\t.catch((err) => next(err));\n});\n\nif (isMainModule(import.meta.url)) {\n\tconst port = process.env['PORT'] || 8080;\n\tapp.listen(port, () => {\n\t\tconsole.log(`Node Express server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);\n\t});\n}\n\nexport const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);\n```\n\nAfter reading #28995 I found out locally the server will do a \"route extraction\" causing it to run the application twice, but on both of these, I'm getting `null` when calling `inject(REQUEST)` during a `provideAppInitializer` call.\n\n```\n// My initializer function\nexport function initializeData() {\n   const request = inject(REQUEST);\n   console.warn('REQUEST is null:', request === null);\n\n   ... other code...\n}\n\n... in my app.config.ts...\nproviders: [\n   provideAppInitializer(intializeData),\n],\n```\n\nThis then logs the following on the local dev server:\n```\n// LOGS\n\nstore  | REQUEST is null: true\nstore  | REQUEST is null: true\n```\n\nAny ideas on what I can look for. I did the upgrade through `ng update` and the migration went smoothly with no issues.\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angularssrlesson-fe2guyge?file=server.ts\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.1.8\nNode: 22.5.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1901.8\n@angular-devkit/core         19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.1.8\n@angular/build               19.1.8\n@angular/cdk                 19.1.5\n@angular/cli                 19.1.8\n@angular/ssr                 19.1.8\n@schematics/angular          19.1.8\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.7.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI've also noticed that `inject(PlatformLocation).search` is empty when my URL always contains query parameters.

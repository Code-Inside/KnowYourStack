This can result in performance bottlenecks, especially if the function is not cheap to compute and/or returns a value of a non-primitive data type.\n\nI find this situation to usually occur, when there is derived state within items of an iterated collection. In the following example, consider `formatUserName` to be a function that is not cheap to compute and very specific to the component (i.e. low potential for app-wide reusability):\n```html\n<ul>\n    @for (user of users; track user.jd) {\n        <li>{{ formatUserName(user) }}</li>\n    }\n</ul>\n```\nThe typical approaches in this situation would be:\n- Writing a pure `| formatUserName` pipe. (-> boilerplate)\n- Wrapping the list item in a component with `OnPush` change detection.

Apparently, the generated Javacript code tries to access the environment before it has been defined.\n\nThis does not happen for all such cases: only apparently when a component imported from the environment itself tries to import another component from the environment.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-g8kmhvqk?file=src%2Fmain.ts for a complete minimal reproduction.\n\nThe code compiles fine, but at runtime we immediately get the following error:\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'childComponent')\n    at children.component.ts:6:25\n    at children.component.ts:6:40\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.7\nNode: 20.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.2.6\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1902.7\n@angular-devkit/core         19.2.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics   19.2.7\n@angular/build               19.2.7\n@angular/cli                 19.2.7\n@schematics/angular          19.2.7\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nRunning `ng serve --configuration production` works fine.\nA workaround consists in replacing\n\n```ts\nimports: [environment.childComponent]\n```\n\nby\n\n```\nimports: [forwardRef(() => environment.childComponent)]\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30091","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"environment is undefined since CLI 19.2.7\" (#30091)"},{"Id":"2987556318","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-11T18:05:15","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30090","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update devinfra digest to 75b0023","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| devinfra | git_repository | digest | `77fb8b4` -> `75b0023` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/compare/v1.25.0...v1.26.0)\n\nBazelisk v1.26.0 comes with several improvements:\n\n### New Features (Go)\n\n-   Implemented option to disable format URL support ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/662](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/662)).\n\n### Bug Fixes & Improvements (Go)\n\n-   Fixed a bug that prevented Bazelisk from being used as a Go dependency via gazelle's `go_deps` extension ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/649](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/649)).\n-   Improved signal handling ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/657](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/657), [https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/658](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/658)).\n-   Improved documentation on how to install Bazelisk on Windows ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/668](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/668)).\n-   Restored debugging symbols in Windows binaries ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/669](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/669)).\n-   Improved `--migrate` mode ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/678](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/678)).\n\nWe’d like to thank our amazing contributors

automatic change detection or manual calls to `ApplicationRef.tick`.\n    Prior to this change, animations would not be flushed in some situations\n    if change detection did not run on any views

However, there are a few points that could enhance clarity and accessibility:\n\n1. Missing Links in Package Table\nThe package overview table lists several Angular component packages like @angular/cdk, @angular/material, @angular/google-maps, and @angular/youtube-player, but the \"Docs\" column mentions \"Docs\" without providing clickable links to the respective documentation pages. Adding direct URLs would improve usability for developers trying to access documentation quickly.\n\n2. Quick Links Section Improvement\nThe Quick Links section mentions helpful resources like:\n\nDocumentation\n\nDemos and Guides\n\nFAQs\n\nContributing\n\nStackBlitz Template\n\nIt would be more developer-friendly if these were formatted as actual links instead of plain text mentions.\n\n3. Clarification on Browser & Screen Reader Support\nThe current section on supported browsers and screen readers is comprehensive. However, it might help to add a last verified version or date for transparency on how recently these compatibility checks were validated.\n\nSuggested Actions:\nUpdate the documentation table with working links to each package’s docs.\n\nConvert the Quick Links into a bulleted list with actual hyperlinks.\n\nAdd timestamps/version notes on browser and screen reader support.\n\nThis would help improve the onboarding experience for new users and make the documentation more navigable.\n\nThanks for the amazing work on Angular Components!\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nreadme","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30846","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): TITLE Suggestion to Improve Documentation Navigation and Component Package Overview\" (#30846)"},{"Id":"2984263258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-10T17:11:58","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30839","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move density tokens to their token files","State":"closed","Body":"Removes the `src/material/core/tokens/_density.scss` file that hosted all component density tokens.

However, when using the fixedTopGap like in the example given in the docs ([via Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fapp%2Fsidenav-responsive-example.ts)), I found out that the Toolbar switches its height from 64px to 56px when on XSmall.\n\nI'd like to add to the docs of the Toolbar at least some mention of the height-changing behavior. From what I can see, only the Toolbar (of all Angular Material components) has a behavior like this and is thus very different from what I was used to. The only mention of a separate mobile height is in the Styling part of the docs and it only mentions there is a value with that name and how to override it.\n\nAdditionally, I'd add something like the following to the docs of fixedTopGap in Sidenav: \n\"When used with Material Toolbar, the value set here should take into consideration the standard-height and mobile-height difference and when it's applied.\"\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/toolbar/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30829","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): Toolbar doesn't mention responsiveness or how it works with Sidenav\" (#30829)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-04-14T03:30:02.5068431Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1535}

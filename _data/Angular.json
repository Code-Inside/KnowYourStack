The content of the processed style is sent directly to the Angular compiler. However, any additional result files are collected and emitted in the application output. In most cases, this worked as expected as inline styles rarely had resource references that would overwrite each other. However, the potential is present for later inline styles for a component to overwrite these output files. To avoid this potential problem, the internal identifier now accounts for both the class name and order of the inline styles.

However, TailwindCSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework, is not included as an option. With TailwindCSS being increasingly adopted, adding it as a stylesheet option would streamline the setup process for developers who use it with Angular.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd TailwindCSS as an option in the ng new command alongside the existing options (CSS, SCSS, LESS, etc.). This would enable developers to choose TailwindCSS as the default stylesheet framework during project creation, allowing for automatic setup and configuration of Tailwind in the generated project.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**  \n\n1. **Installing TailwindCSS Manually After Initializing the Project**  \n   The current workaround for using TailwindCSS with Angular involves initializing a new project with `ng new` and then following these steps manually:\n   \n   - Install TailwindCSS and required PostCSS plugins:\n     ```bash\n     npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\n     ```\n   - Generate the Tailwind configuration file:\n     ```bash\n     npx tailwindcss init\n     ```\n   - Update `tailwind.config.js` to define the content paths, like so:\n     ```javascript\n     module.exports = {\n       content: [\n         \"./src/**/*.{html,ts}\",\n       ],\n       theme: {\n         extend: {},\n       },\n       plugins: [],\n     }\n     ```\n   - Configure `styles.css` (or `styles.scss`) with Tailwind directives:\n     ```css\n     @tailwind base;\n     @tailwind components;\n     @tailwind utilities;\n     ```\n   - Optionally, create a `postcss.config.js` file if not already present to ensure compatibility with Angular's build.\n\n   While these steps are not overly complex, they add additional configuration overhead, especially for developers who are setting up multiple projects or who are new to Angular or TailwindCSS. This manual process can also introduce errors if configuration steps are missed or misconfigured.\n\n2. **Using a Third-Party TailwindCSS Integration**  \n   Some developers have created community guides and packages that streamline the Tailwind setup for Angular, but these are not officially supported and may lack the stability or compatibility assurance that comes with a native CLI integration. Additionally, relying on third-party solutions can introduce maintenance challenges if the third-party solution is no longer actively maintained.\n\n3. **Creating a Custom Schematic for TailwindCSS Setup**  \n   Angular allows developers to create custom schematics, which could automate the setup of TailwindCSS after project initialization. However, creating and maintaining a custom schematic requires extra knowledge and effort, and it adds another layer of customization that developers need to maintain across projects. This approach is often impractical for teams who need a simple, standard setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAdding TailwindCSS as an option in the Angular CLI would remove the need for these workarounds, allowing developers to select TailwindCSS during project initialization and have it configured automatically. This native support would reduce setup time, avoid common configuration errors, and enhance the developer experience by aligning Angular with modern CSS practices.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28801","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add TailwindCSS as a Stylesheet Format Option in Angular CLI\" (#28801)"},{"Id":"2637565326","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-06T12:39:29","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28800","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): skip wildcard routes from being listed as prerendered routes","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nThis fix ensures that the wildcard routes are not included in the prerendered list, improving the accuracy of prerendered route generation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28800","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): skip wildcard routes from being listed as prerendered routes\" (#28800)"},{"Id":"2636584761","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-06T09:26:56","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28796","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): use structured component stylesheet tracking for hot replacement","State":"closed","Body":"When using the development server with the application builder, the internal state of any external component stylesheets is now more comprehensively tracked.

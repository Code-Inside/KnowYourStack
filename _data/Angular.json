For tests, this means that the error will be rethrown by default rather than only logging the error.

The result is that `ng_package`/APF is now smartly able to generate shared chunks for things that are needed between multiple entry-points.

For Zone-based applications, these errors would have\n    been caught by ZoneJS and reported to `ErrorHandler` so the result is\n    generally the same. The change to the exact mechanism for reporting can\n    result in differences in test environments that will require test\n    updates.\n\n##### core\n\n-   -   TypeScript versions less than 5.8 are no longer supported.\n-   `PendingTasks.run` no longer returns the result of the\n    async function. If this behavior is desired, it can be re-implemented\n    manually with the `PendingTasks.add`. Be aware, however, that promise rejections\n    will need to be handled or they can cause the node process to shut down\n    when using SSR.\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- |

We are aware of the many Windows users using the `ng` CLI.\r\n\r\nWhat is changing? We are no longer actively working towards a Bazel infrastructure that supports native Windows building and testing. There are currently two ways to contribute to Angular on Windows. That is via WSL, or via e.g. native Windows cmd.exe, with Git Bash on top. We acknowledge that the latter worked sometimes, but we also realize it very often breaks as nobody on our team uses, verifies it, and it introduces extra complexity because Bazel on Windows is quite disconnected from Linux/Mac (e.g. no sandboxing). Going forward, to improve our team's effectiveness, and improve our stability guarantees for Windows (and Windows contributors), we are actively discouraging the use of Git Bash for contributing to Angular; but instead ask for WSL to be used. I can speak as one of the few long-term team members that have worked on Windows (without WSL) most of my time, that WSL is great and the contributing experience is much smoother and also easier to \"guide\". It's a positive change because we won't be suggesting \"two ways to contribute on Windows\", where in reality one is very brittle and can break at any time!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29750","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[19.2.x] build: update dev-infra and rework windows native testing\" (#29750)"},{"Id":"2893059358","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-04T15:16:58","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"29745","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/eslint-plugin) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/HEAD/packages/eslint-plugin)) | devDependencies | minor | [`8.25.0` -> `8.26.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2feslint-plugin/8.25.0/8.26.0) |\n| [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/parser) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/HEAD/packages/parser)) | devDependencies | minor | [`8.25.0` -> `8.26.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2fparser/8.25.0/8.26.0) |\n| [aspect_bazel_lib](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib) | http_archive | minor | `v2.13.0` -> `v2.14.0` |\n\n---\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Some dependencies could not be looked up.

technically in common use-cases it doesn't happen much that there is only a single `mousemove` event under special conditions, e.g. using a Pen/Stylus its probably possible so I recommend removing this early-return which would make it work for Playwright:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/7abd0ebbe48755ff5403a78820c7f6211ab4f56a/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L712\n\nPlaywright bug: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/34688\n\n### Reproduction\n\nRun the following Playwright test:\n\n```ts\nimport { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest('should drag-drop', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/examples');\n  await page.locator('button', { hasText: /got it/ }).click();\n  await expect (page.locator('.popup')).toBeHidden();\n  const example = page.locator('example-viewer', { hasText: 'Drag&Drop connected sorting group'})\n  await example.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded();\n  const leftColumn = example.locator('.example-container').nth(0);\n  const rightColumn = example.locator('.example-container').nth(1);\n  await leftColumn.getByText('Get to work').dragTo(rightColumn.getByText('Take a shower'));\n  await expect(rightColumn.getByText('Get to work')).toBeVisible();\n});\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWorks.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDoes not work.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:

option to NOT truncate, a long/multi-line mat-label within a mat-form-field","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nWe have a situation where we need a very short input (4 digits) but it has a very long label.\nMUCH wider than the required input, and sometimes, much wider than the parent container/page.\n\nUnfortunately, specifying a size on the mat-form-field not only resizes the input, it also resizes and truncates the label to the point of uselessness.\n\nExamples:\n\nIn the first field below, we've set the `mat-form-field` style to `width: 16.666667%`\n\nSmall input with truncated label:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4f0700a-be3a-4983-90d6-7668ecc2fce7)\n\nUpdated styles with label width 600% to match the parent container (6 x 16.666667%)\nThis _does_ make the label the full width, however, it's still not big enough to display the full text:\n```css\n.mat-mdc-form-field .mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper .mat-mdc-form-field-flex .mat-mdc-form-field-infix .mat-mdc-floating-label {\n    width: 600% !important;\n}\n```\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c340ece-dbc6-48b8-91a0-d8b865bbae04)\n\nSo, we added wrapping, to ensure the full label (and the trailing tooltip icon component within the label) is displayed:\n```css\n.mat-mdc-form-field .mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper .mat-mdc-form-field-flex .mat-mdc-form-field-infix .mat-mdc-floating-label {\n    width: 600% !important;\n    text-wrap: auto;\n}\n```\nUnfortunately, this then overlaps the input, as the position of the label is hard-coded in the material styles...\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f86cbd5-f059-443d-849f-6c3f3132da89)\n\nGiven the DOM of the component after rendering, I can't see any simple way to untangle this problem.\n\nObviously, on mobile devices this problem is exacerbated substantially:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71e24f13-2293-4010-9910-9fb56974cc80)\n\nAny suggestions would be great.\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30578","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(mat-form-field / mat-label): we need

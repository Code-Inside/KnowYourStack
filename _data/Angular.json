Micro Frontend is lazy loaded by platform application. An issue came up when Angular element is reattached to DOM. The component contained in Angular element that was last rendered previously would always be created and destroyed before the actual page is rendered. This is the scenario: \r\n\r\n1. The Micro Frontend is Angular element which contains 2 components. Let's name them A and B. \r\n2. The platform application lazy loads Micro Frontend when user navigates to page A backed by component A \r\n3. User navigates to page B backed by component B\r\n4. User navigates to platform home page. \r\n5. User navigates to page A again. I would observe the creation and destruction of component B instance before component A instance is created and page A rendered. The observation is done by console log constructor() and ngOnInit() of component B.\r\n\r\nIt's on step #5 that creation and destruction of component B instance is causing trouble for us. User's intend was to go to page A, not B. The issue becomes visible to end user when component B ngOnInit() initiates service calls to retrieve data for page B. These service calls for page B are bogus. Backend service could reject them because user permissions may have changed since page B was last visited. \r\n\r\nProject https://github.com/fboeller/microfrontends-with-angular/tree/recording by Fabian Böller can be used as base code to illustrate the issue. Add console logs to constructor and ngOnInit() of BookingFormComponent and BookingListComponent. From homepage, user can navigate to \"My Bookings\" page and then \"Book special offer now\", and then back to homepage. Hit F12 to open browser dev console. Navigate to \"My Bookings\" page again. Console logs should show the creation and destruction of components A&B. \r\n\r\nWe have tested it with Angular 9 to 15 and the behavior is consistent. It is a blocker for our project because the bogus service calls were failing. We have tried to add debounceTime() so that service calls inside ngOnInit() would not be made before the component is destroyed. It worked to certain extend but the hack could fail if end user computer is too slow for ngOnDestroy() to come around. Delay of 300ms may become noticeable to end user but even that may not be sufficient in all cases.\r\n \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/fboeller/microfrontends-with-angular/tree/recording \n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 15.2.4\r\nNode: 16.13.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.0\r\nOS: win 32 x64\r\nAngular: 15.2.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nWe tested Angular 9 to 15, Node.js 14.17.4 to 16.13.0.

present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nSince `$localize` is not explicitly initialized anymore, but just included as type and initialized by cli, I think external test runners have some issues.\r\nIn particular, I'm using `vscode-jest-runner` extension, and when I use its codeLens option to run a single test, it fails if the components involved use i18n, because it can't find `$localize`, despite the type being listed in `tsconfig.spec.json`'s `types`. \r\nWhen running test architect from cli everything works.\r\nAt the moment my workaround is to explicitly initialize `$localize` in `test-setup.ts` with the old `import '@angular/localize/init';`, hoping this will not interfere when test are launched from cli (double initialization?).\r\nIs there any other way?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n- use i18n in a component\r\n- test the component outside ng-cli\r\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI:

I understand it is for performance improvement, But for already existing big enterprise-level applications, with many developers, it poses a big problem. Since many devs are working, an import-based circular dependency can be easily inserted in any part of the code, and with the useful 'circular dependency warnings' removed, there is no way to find such issues. And these issues may cause application to actually break in production. Which causes a huge impact on our reputation with the customer. We tried the alternatives suggested, but no luck\r\n\r\n1) Eslint -> import/no-cycle -> Makes our linter in CI run for more than 1.5 hours and finally breaks\r\n14:55:00  Linting \"@abcd/mnop-efgh\"...\r\n16:27:07  Cannot contact xyz-slave1: java.lang.InterruptedException\r\nThis is probably because our application is very big\r\n\r\n2) Madge -> Only found the type-based circular dependencies and no other circular dependencies... It is able to detect all circ-deps for a smaller application, But since our app is huge it is probably not able to find anything relevant.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n1) Keep the showCircularDependencies flag for development and not have it in production. In the angular.json we can have a warning, if showCircularDependencies is set to true, stating, \"Do not use in Production as it will slow the build\".\r\n\r\n2) Angular can have another script, which after running can let us know the circular dependency warnings. This script can be based on the build, used in Angular-13 or before... which finds circular dependencies. This script will be different from the build so no performance impact will be there.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAs mentioned above eslint and madge were tried, but no value was added.

mentioned in the docs.\r\nI'd either try to refactor the code so that the context isn't lost by invoking the handler from the logic of the MatSlider component (and therefore switching the implementation context), or mention it into the docs so that users don't get perplexed by the weird context

Within that components, I have a mat-select, which is not displaying any options, as the title mentioned. When I click on it, the select field itself is focused and gets the correct classes, but the options overlay is not appearing.\r\n\r\nMy guess is, that something is wrong with the handling of the overlay in combination with dynamically generated components. When checking the DOM, I could see that the overlay container was not added to the body. Outside of the dynamic component the exact same mat-select works as expected. I also tried to create a dialog within my dynamic component and it also works fine (overlay container is attached to the body).\r\n\r\nEvery other functionality within the component is working as well (root services, ngrx store, ...).\r\n\r\nThere are no console errors.\r\n\r\nModule imports contain MatSelectModule, MatInputModule & MatFormFieldModule.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or am I just missing something?\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. add mat-select to popupComponent:\r\n```\r\n<mat-form-field appearance=\"fill\">\r\n\t<mat-select multiple [formControl]=\"statusFormControl\">\r\n\t\t<mat-option *ngFor=\"let status of statuses\" [value]=\"status\">{{ status.id }}</mat-option>\r\n\t</mat-select>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Generate Component with createComponent(), using a generic EnvironmentInjector:\r\n\r\n`const popupComponent: ComponentRef<PopupComponent> = createComponent(PopupComponent, {\r\n\tenvironmentInjector: this._environmentInjector\r\n});`\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Add data to the component and execute change detection:\r\n\r\n`component.instance.statuses = statuses;\r\ncomponent.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();`\r\n\r\n\r\n4. bind content to map popup (might be a possible source for the bug as well):\r\n\r\n`mapMarker.bindPopup(popupComponent.location.nativeElement as Content);`\r\n\r\n\r\n5. when opening the popup on the map and clicking on the select, the highlighting is correct, but nothing else happens:\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125544629/225877898-4a2c8117-ce56-41ac-9fc0-37570d2e91da.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nmat-options should show up\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmat-options notshowing up, overlay container not attached\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.0.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox 102.8\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): mat-options not showing up on dynamically generated component\" (#26803)"},{"Id":"1628386782","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-16T22:30:14","Actor":"zarend","Number":"26801","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(select, autocomplete): strong focus indicator not present for selected option","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFor options in a select or autocomplete, strong focus only appears on items that are *not* selected.

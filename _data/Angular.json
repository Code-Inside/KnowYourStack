Create a file with two components in it, where the second component is standalone and uses the NgIf directive and imports it directly or via the CommonModule.\r\n2. Remove the NgIf or CommonModule import from the component, and see the warning that says \"The `*ngIf` directive was used in the template, but neither the `NgIf` directive nor the `CommonModule` was imported....\"\r\n3.

I don't know whether this is actually a bug or I did not understand something about any of yarn, typescript, esm, commonjs, angular, webpack...\r\n\r\nWhen using a simple angular project as a yarn workspace, I cannot use the exports of a sibling project.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHere is the description of how to reproduce the issue, I attached the whole project as well\r\n\r\n[myproject.zip](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/12464740/myproject.zip)\r\n\r\n1. create a yarn workspace root package.json, pointing to the two workspaces we will create now\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"myproject\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"workspaces\": [\r\n    \"angular\",\r\n    \"lib\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. create a simple angular project\r\n`ng new angular` (then, keep the default value for everything that is asked)\r\n3. add the \"private\": true entry in its package.json to indicate it is a workspace\r\n4. create a very simple library called lib\r\nwith the following package.json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"@mylib/lib\",\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"private\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand the following index.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const somevariable = \"something\";\r\n```\r\n5. indicate in the package.json of the angular workspace the dependency toward the sibling library, adding `\"@mylib/lib\": \"^0.1.0\",` in its dependency section.\r\n6. in the root component on the angular workspace, make use of the variable\r\n`import { somevariable } from '@mylib/lib';`\r\nand then, set the title to somevariable \r\n```typescript\r\n...\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  title = somevariable;\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n7. run `ng serve`\r\n\r\nYou will see that somevariable does not appear.\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/1181438/7bc2edf6-3059-423e-a311-2d6bc6a289dd)\r\n\r\nStrangely, changing `import { somevariable } from '@mylib/lib';` into `import { somevariable } from '../../../lib';` works around this issue. You need to `rm -rf .angular/ && ng serve` to actually see the impact of the change.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/1181438/fdf4e2a0-ee8f-4a27-8388-26edcef10df6)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n✔  ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.0\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.0\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.1.6\r\nzone.js                         0.13.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nRunning `ng build` in development mode, I could find out that the webpack export was actually empty where `somevariable` should have been.\r\n\r\nthe bundled code looks like this\r\n```\r\nclass AppComponent {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    this.title = _mylib_lib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.somevariable;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith `_mylib_lib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__` defined like this `/* harmony import */ var _mylib_lib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ = __webpack_require__(/*! @mylib/lib */ 6479);`\r\n\r\nThen, the content associated to 6479 is the following\r\n```\r\n/***/ 6479:\r\n/*!***********************!*\\\r\n  !*** ../lib/index.ts ***!\r\n  \\***********************/\r\n/***/ (() => {\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/***/ })\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume there has been some too eager tree-shaking somewhere.\r\n\r\nThank you again for angular.

It doesn't matter if the page is scrolled or how the elementRef is positioned. As soon as the address bar is visible there is no issue.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://building-tooltip-ovwh6v.stackblitz.io/\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the example at https://building-tooltip-ovwh6v.stackblitz.io/ in a mobile browser (tried on Pixel 7 and iPhone 13).\r\n2. Scroll down until the address bar is removed, but the button still has enough room on top to display a tooltip.\r\n3. Hover over or click the tooltip button located at the bottom of the page.\r\n4. The tooltip that should appear above the button is displayed in the wrong position.\r\n5. Scrolling to the top moves the tooltip to the correct location.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe tooltip should appear in the correct location, even when the address bar is hidden on a mobile browser.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn mobile browsers, when using a position strategy with `overlayY: 'bottom'` for a tooltip, the tooltip's location becomes incorrect when the address bar is hidden. This seems to be affecting the calculation of the tooltip's position, placing it in the wrong location on the page.\r\n\r\n**Position Strategy Used:**\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  originX: 'center',\r\n  originY: 'top',\r\n  overlayX: 'center',\r\n  overlayY: 'bottom',\r\n  offsetY: -8,\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16 (example shows it exists in 7 as well)\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System: iOS/Android\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27739","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(FlexibleConnectedPositionStrategy): Incorrect position on mobile browsers

Specifically, the `aria-expanded` property will not correctly follow the open sub-menu. After some investigation this seems to simply be caused by the `CdkMenuTrigger` not using `detectChanges()` or `markForCheck()` from the `ChangeDetectorRef` after opening and closing the menu overlay. The attachment state of the menu overlay is used to populate `aria-expanded` directly.\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by having the `OnPush` parent listen to `(opened)` and `(closed)` events emitted by the trigger, but that is not very scalable since each menu item would then require two additional handlers inside every `OnPush` component.\r\n\r\nI will be sending a pull request that will make the `CdkMenuTrigger` call relevant methods from the `ChangeDetectorRef` at appropriate times to support being placed in `OnPush` components.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-uc7xxl\r\n\r\n*Note: In the StackBlitz the style of menu items is changed based on the `aria-expanded` property of the element. If the element has `aria-expanded` set to `true` the item will appear with a black background and white text. This is supposed to make it easy to see how `aria-expanded` updates.*\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a an inline `CdkMenu` or a `CdkMenuBar` in a component using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`\r\n2. Add sub-menus to the items of the inline menu\r\n3. Click any of the items to open its sub-menu\r\n4. Hover to any other item with a sub-menu\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen hovering over another item with a sub-menu, the `aria-expanded` property of the newly hovered item should be set to `true` and that of the previous item should be set to `false`. The `aria-expanded` property should be `true` for the item that has an open sub-menu at all times. When clicking outside the menu all sub-menus should close and `aria-expanded` should be `false` for all items in the menu.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `aria-expanded` property continues to be `true` on the initially clicked element regardless of the item hovered and where the open sub-menu is. It also continues to be `true` for an item even when all sub-menus are closed.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.2.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): Version 116.0.5845.110 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27725","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/menu): Trigger does not update ARIA values correctly in `OnPush` components\" (#27725)"},{"Id":"1872006393","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-29T16:19:31","Actor":"nagamanikandanKannappan","Number":"27724","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): @angular/google-maps not working in Angular CLI: 15.0.5","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n**_ng version_**\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 15.0.5\r\nNode: 18.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.1.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.0.5\r\n@angular/cli                    15.0.5\r\n@angular/google-maps            16.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             15.0.5\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**_Issues:_**\r\n\r\n1.

However, this can only be reproduced when just tapping onto the select and pressing the arrow keys. When expanding the dropdown first (using either the enter key or the mouse), the values change as expected. This means a downgrade from the native select, since there the bug doesn't exist. Both variants can be found on given REPL link.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThe interactive example in this Angular documentation can be used to reproduce:\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/select/overview\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on Jaws screenreader and either connect a Braille display, or use the Braille viewer\r\n2. Tap to the mat-select (don't expand it as described above), and press up and down arrow keys\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSelected option on the Braille display changes synchronized to the actual value on screen.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe value on the screen gets asynchronous from the value on the Braille display. Changes are sent through as flash messages, but once they disappear we're out of sync, so following the convention would be better here.\r\nContinue tapping until you get to the native select on the same page, and there you find it working as it should.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.2.9\r\n- CDK/Material: Wasn't displayed when running ng version\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox 116.0.3, Google Chrome 116.0.5845.111\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows11\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27721","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): value changes not always shown on a Braille display\" (#27721)"},{"Id":"1869666098","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-28T12:59:29","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27720","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: bump node version","State":"closed","Body":"Updates to a slightly newer version of Node.

Lets say the name of component for this web-component is `TestComponent`.

Please consider adding first class support for decoration to the DI system. Doing so would make a number of use-cases cleaner and (probably) more efficient. \r\n\r\nTo clarify my use of the term \"decoration\" in this context, I mean: A function that takes an input injectable from an injector, and can either update or replace or wrap the input injectable, and returns an injectable that is used in place of the input injectable.\r\n\r\nI do not mean typescript decorators (eg `@MyDecorator()`). Perhaps another term should be used to avoid confusion, but the term decoration seems appropriate as a well-known pattern.\r\n\r\nUse cases include:\r\n\r\n1. Configuring injectables\r\n2. Replacing or wrapping default injectables in a component tree\r\n3. Providing an injectable for a component tree only if not provided by an ancestor\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI envision this feature working much like provider factory functions today, but adding the input injectable as a factory function argument. Decorator functions would be run after the object is initially created. The notion of `@SkipSelf()` is used to obtain an instance from a parent injector, but decorator functions should be able to run in the same injector where the object was created.\r\n\r\nA provider factory function is specified today using:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction createFoo(): Foo {\r\n  return new Foo();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: 'my-directive',\r\n  providers: [{\r\n    provide: Foo,\r\n    useFactory: createFoo\r\n  }]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyDirective ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nA decorator could be specified as follows:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction decorateFoo(input: Foo | null, ...args: any[]): Foo | null {\r\n  if (input) {\r\n     input.doSomething();\r\n     return input;\r\n  }\r\n  else return new Foo();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: 'my-directive',\r\n  providers: [{\r\n    provide: Foo,\r\n    useDecorator: decorateFoo,\r\n    deps: [ dependencies that are injected as args ]\r\n  }]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyDirective ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe syntax shouldn't be limited to directives/components, it could also be used in modules.\r\n\r\n#### Configuration use case\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction disableAnimation(animationManager) {\r\n  animationManager?.animationEnabled = false;\r\n  return animationManager;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  providers: [{\r\n    provide: AnimationManager,\r\n    useDecorator: disableAnimation\r\n  }]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyTestModule { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `AnimationManager` is a normal `@Injectable` service, which would be created normally (its dependencies injected), and then passed through the decorator function before use.\r\n\r\n#### Wrap injectable use case\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction wrapDemoTheme(themeSettings) {\r\n  const demoTheme = inject(DemoThemeSettings);\r\n  demoTheme.currentTheme = themeSettings;\r\n  return demoTheme;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  providers: [{\r\n    provide: ThemeSettings,\r\n    useDecorator: wrapDemoTheme\r\n  }]\r\n})\r\nexport class DemoThemeComponent{  \r\n  constructor(private readonly _themeSettings: ThemeSettings) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Provide if absent use case\r\n\r\nIn this use case, a `PopupController` instance provided by parent directives should be used, but if an instance doesn't exist one is provided by the component.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction ensurePopupController(inherited: PopupController | null): PopupController {\r\n  if (inherited) {\r\n    return inherited;\r\n  }\r\n  return new PopupController(inject(FocusManager));\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  providers: [{\r\n    provide: PopupController,\r\n    useDecorator: ensurePopupController\r\n  }]\r\n})\r\nexport class PopupComponent{ \r\n  constructor(private readonly _controller: PopupController) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI don't believe there are any good workarounds for decorating module providers, aside from using different injector tokens for the input and decorated output, and using a factory function for the output. If one were to use the same injector token for the input and decorated output, using `InjectFlags.SkipSelf` at the root injector would fail (would reach the null injector), and not using `InjectFlags.SkipSelf` would result an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 alternatives I've used for implementing decorator patterns in the element injector tree:\r\n\r\n1. Inject a component or directive with `@SkipSelf()` and provide the dependency to children - this works, but clutters up the directive with a lot of code, and the directive has to inject all the constructor parameters to create the provided dependencies.\r\n2. Use a factory function that injects the dependency with `InjectFlags.SkipSelf`, and returns the decorated version. This is closer to ideal, but is buggy today, [due to spotty implementations of `InjectFlags.SkipSelf`](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31776#issuecomment-744747820).\r\n\r\nNote that neither of these provide exactly what I'd like, as both use `SkipSelf`. As noted above, it would be preferable to be able to decorate an object without obtaining the decorator input from a parent injector.\r\n\r\nHere's an example showing the first alternative (inject and provide the dependency in a directive):\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'ui-popup',\r\n  ...\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {\r\n      provide: PopupController,\r\n      useFactory: (c: PopupComponent) => c.controller,\r\n      deps: [ PopupComponent ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      provide: FOCUS_AREA,\r\n      useFactory: (c: PopupComponent) => c.focusArea,\r\n      deps: [ PopupComponent ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class PopupComponent {\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * A @see PopupController that controls display of the popup. Created\r\n   * on demand if not set or injected.\r\n   */\r\n  @Input()\r\n  public get controller(): PopupController {\r\n    if (!this._controller) {\r\n      this._controller = new PopupController(this._focusManager);\r\n    }\r\n    return this._controller;\r\n  }\r\n  public set controller(p: PopupController) {\r\n    if (p !== this._controller) {\r\n      this._controller = p;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  private _controller?: PopupController;\r\n\r\n  /** Returns the inherited or local FocusArea */\r\n  public get focusArea(): FocusArea {\r\n    return this._inheritedFocusArea ?? this._thisFocusArea;\r\n  }\r\n  private readonly _thisFocusArea?: FocusArea;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private readonly _elt: ElementRef<HTMLElement>,\r\n    private readonly _focusManager: FocusManager,\r\n    @Inject(FOCUS_AREA) @Optional() @Host() @SkipSelf() inheritedFocusArea?: FocusArea,\r\n    @Optional() @Host() @SkipSelf() popupController?: PopupController\r\n  ) {\r\n    if (!this._inheritedFocusArea) {\r\n      this._thisFocusArea = new FocusArea(elt, _focusManager);\r\n    }\r\n    this._controller = popupController;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example component provides 2 objects to its children (a FocusArea and PopupController), if they aren't provided by ancestors. I've cut out all the code related to what the component does. Note that this works, but it adds a lot of unnecessary complexity to the component. All the dependencies needed to instantiate the FocusArea and PopupController wouldn't otherwise be needed in the component.\r\n\r\nFor the second alternative, I was able to create a more reusable method for providing missing dependencies (one of the decorator use-cases), but as described below it's problematic. Here's the logic for creating missing dependencies (returns a `FactoryProvider`):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/**\r\n * Like a `FactoryProvider`, but the factory function is only called if the\r\n * dependency is not already provided by a parent injector.\r\n */\r\nexport interface IfAbsentFactoryProvider<T> {\r\n  /** The `Type<T>` or `InjectionToken<T>` to inject. */\r\n  provide: Type<T> | InjectionToken<T>;\r\n  /** A factory function to create a T */\r\n  factory: (...args: any[]) => T;\r\n  /** Injectable dependencies that are passed to the `factory` function. */\r\n  deps?: any[];\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Injects an instance of type T if not already provided by a parent.\r\n *\r\n * @param provide A `Type<T>` or `InjectionToken<T>`\r\n * @param factory A factory function to create a T\r\n * @param deps Injectable dependencies that are passed to the `factory` function.\r\n */\r\nexport function provideIfAbsent<T>(\r\n  p: IfAbsentFactoryProvider<T> | Type<T>): FactoryProvider {\r\n\r\n  let provide: Type<T> | InjectionToken<T>;\r\n  let factory: (...args: any[]) => T;\r\n  let deps: any[] | undefined;\r\n  if (typeof(p) === 'function') {\r\n    provide = p as Type<T>;\r\n    factory = () => new p();\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    provide = p.provide;\r\n    factory = p.factory;\r\n    deps = p.deps;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // See https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31776\r\n  // Injector.get() currently doesn't support InjectFlags.\r\n  // inject() works in Ivy (only), which requires us to use karma for any tests that need Ivy\r\n  // We can convert the tests back to Jest once this bug is fixed, or Jest supports Ivy. Grrr.\r\n  let factoryDepth = 0;\r\n\r\n  // Injector version:\r\n  //function ifAbsentFactory(injector: Injector, ...args: any[]): T {\r\n\r\n  function ifAbsentFactory(...args: any[]): T {\r\n    if (factoryDepth === 0) {\r\n      factoryDepth++; // Protect against recursion\r\n\r\n      // See if there's an inherited instance of T\r\n      const t: T | null = inject(provide, InjectFlags.Optional | InjectFlags.SkipSelf);\r\n      // Injector version: = injector.get<T>(provide, undefined, InjectFlags.Optional | InjectFlags.SkipSelf);\r\n      factoryDepth--;\r\n      if (t !== null) {\r\n        return t;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // No inherited instance; use the factory function\r\n    return factory(...args);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    provide,\r\n    useFactory: ifAbsentFactory,\r\n    deps: deps // Injector version: ? [ Injector, ...deps ] : [ Injector ]\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's an equivalent example to the first showing how it can be used: \r\n```ts\r\n/** Provides a new FocusArea if one isn't already provided. */\r\nexport const inheritOrNewFocusArea= provideIfAbsent({\r\n  provide: FOCUS_AREA,\r\n  factory: (elt: ElementRef<HTMLElement>, fm: FocusManager) => new FocusArea(elt, fm),\r\n  deps: [ElementRef<HTMLElement>, FocusManager]\r\n});\r\n\r\n/** Provides a new PopupController if one isn't already provided. */\r\nexport const inheritOrNewPopupController = provideIfAbsent({\r\n  provide: PopupController,\r\n  factory: (fm: FocusManager) => new PopupController(fm),\r\n  deps: [FocusManager]\r\n});\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'ui-popup',\r\n  template: '<ng-content></ng-content>',\r\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n  providers: [\r\n    inheritOrNewFocusArea,\r\n    inheritOrNewPopupController\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class PopupComponent {\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    @Inject(FOCUS_AREA) private readonly _focusArea: FocusArea\r\n    private readonly _controller: PopupController,\r\n  ) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty close to what I'd like to see, but one issue is that it only works in Ivy ([ `inject()` fails in ViewEngine, and `InjectFlags.SkipSelf` is not currently supported by node injector](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31776#issuecomment-744747820) ). So, I'm not able to use our jest tests with it (for now) because jest compiles to ViewEngine (today).\r\n\r\nEven though this second alternative is close, and is almost viable, I believe this is a feature worth adding, because it would cover all the use-cases. \r\n\r\n### Other comments\r\nI think the expressiveness alone of something like `useDecorator`, given how frequently the pattern is used, would be nice for many code bases. It would also be very handy for test code. I acknowledge that `provide: (token)` may not be appropriate for decoration, I'm on the fence about that.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that first class support for dependency decoration could be more efficient than putting it all in factory functions, because it could be (partly or mostly) wired up by the compiler, reducing runtime code.\r\n\r\nI suspect that it would enable many apps to be written with less code, enough to more than offset the addition to @angular/core.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40141","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"First-class support for dependency decoration\" (#40141)"},{"Id":"768251654","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-15T22:16:47","Actor":"atscott","Number":"40140","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(language-service): Initial implementation of find rename locations","State":"open","Body":"Commit 1:\r\nThis commit lays the groundwork for potentially providing rename\r\nlocations from the Ivy native LS. The approach is very similar to what\r\nwas done with the feature to find references. One difference, however,\r\nis that we did not require the references to be fully \"correct\". That\r\nis, the exact text spans did not matter so much, as long as we provide a\r\nlocation that logically includes the referenced item.\r\n\r\nAn example of a necessary difference between rename locations and references is\r\ndirectives. The entire element in the template is a \"reference\" of the\r\ndirective's class. However, it's not a valid location to be renamed. The\r\nsame goes for aliased inputs/outputs. The locations in the template\r\ndirectly map to the class property, which is correct for references, but\r\nwould not be correct for rename locations, which should instead map to\r\nthe string node fo the alias.\r\n\r\nAs an initial approach to address the aforementioned issues with rename\r\nlocations, we check that all the rename location nodes have the same text. If\r\n_any_ node has text that differs from the request, we do not return any\r\nrename locations. This works as a way to prevent renames that could\r\nbreak the the program by missing some required nodes in the rename action, but\r\nallowing other nodes to be renamed.\r\n\r\nCommit 2:\r\nImplement `getRenameInfo`\r\n\r\nThe `getRenameInfo` action is used by consumers to\r\n\r\n1.

See [Strict mode](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/strict-mode.md) and [Options](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/api.md) for more details\n-   to make code injection from untrusted schemas impossible, [code generation](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/codegen.md) is fully re-written to be type-level safe against code injection.\n-   to simplify Ajv extensions, the new keyword API that is used by pre-defined keywords is available to user-defined keywords - it is much easier to define any keywords now, especially with subschemas.\n-   schemas are compiled to ES6 code (ES5 code generation is supported with an option).\n-   to improve reliability and maintainability the code is migrated to TypeScript.\n-   separate Ajv classes from draft-07 and draft-2019-09 support with different default imports (see [Getting started](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv#usage) or [v7.0.0-beta.5](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.5) for the details).\n\n**Please note**:\n\n-   the support for JSON-Schema draft-04 is removed - if you have schemas using \"id\" attributes you have to replace them with \"\\\\$id\" (or continue using version 6 that will be supported until 02/28/2021).\n-   all formats are separated to [ajv-formats](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv-formats) package - they have to be explicitly added if you use them.\n-   Ajv instance can only be created with `new` keyword, as Ajv is now ES6 class.\n-   browser bundles are automatically published to ajv-dist package (but still available on cdnjs.com).\n\n#### Better TypeScript support:\n\n-   Methods `compile` and `compileAsync` now return type-guards - see [Getting started](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tree/v7-beta#usage).\n-   Method `validate` is a type-guard.\n-   Better separation of asynchronous schemas on type level.\n-   Type utility JSONSchemaType<T> that generates the type for JSON Schema for type interface in the type parameter - it simplifies writing schemas (no unions support at the moment).\n\n#### API changes:\n\n-   addVocabulary - NEW method that allows to add an array of keyword definitions.\n-   addKeyword - keyword name should be passed as property in definition object, not as the first parameter (old API works with \"deprecated\" warning). Also \"inline\" keywords support is removed, code generation keywords can now be defined with \"code\" keyword - the same definition format that is used by all pre-defined keywords\n-   Ajv no longer allows to create the instance without `new` keyword (it is ES6 class). \n\n##### Added options (and defaults):\n\n-   strict: true - strict mode\n-   strictTypes: \"log\" - prevent mistakes related to type keywords and keyword applicability (see [Strict Types](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/strict-mode.md#strict-types))\n-   strictTuples: \"log\" - prevent incomplete tuple schemas (see [Prohibit unconstrained tuples](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/strict-mode.md#prohibit-unconstrained-tuples))\n-   allowUnionTypes: false - allow multiple non-null types in \"type\" keyword\n-   allowMatchingProperties: false - allow overlap between \"properties\" and \"patternProperties\" keywords\n-   loopEnum: Infinity - optimise validation of enums, similar to `loopRequired`\n-   validateFormats: true - enable format validation\n-   code: {optimize: number|boolean} - control [code optimisation](https://togithub.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/v7-beta/docs/codegen.md#code-optimization)\n-   code: {es5: true} - generate ES5 code, the default is to generate ES6 code.\n-   code: {lines: true} - add line breaks to generated code - simplifies debugging of compiled schemas when you need it\n\n##### Changed options:\n\n-   `keywords` - now expects the array of keyword definitions (old API works with \"deprecated\" warning)\n\n##### Removed options:\n\n-   errorDataPath - was deprecated, now removed.\n-   format - `validateFormats: false` can be used instead, old format mode can be chosen via ajv-formats package.\n-   nullable: `nullable` keyword is supported by default.\n-   jsonPointers: JSONPointers are used to report errors by default, `jsPropertySyntax: true` (deprecated) can be used if old format is needed.\n-   extendRefs: $ref siblings are validated by default (consistent with draft 2019-09), `ignoreKeywordsWithRef` (deprecated) can be used instead to ignore $ref siblings.\n-   missingRefs: now exception is always thrown. Pass empty schema with $id that should be ignored to ajv.addSchema.\n-   processCode: replaced with `code: {process: (code, schemaEnv: object) => string}`.\n-   sourceCode: replaced with `code: {source: true}`.\n-   schemaId: removed, as JSON Schema draft-04 is no longer supported.\n-   strictDefaults, strictKeywords, strictNumbers: it is default now, controlled with `strict`.\n-   uniqueItems: '\"uniqueItems\" keyword is always validated.\n-   unknownFormats: the same can be achieved by passing true for formats that need to be ignored via `ajv.addFormat` or `formats` option.\n-   cache and serialize: Map is used as cache, schema object as key.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

After it, I realized that the method `buildDefaultPath` was removed from `@schematics/angular/utility/project`, and I should use the new one from `@schematics/angular/utility/workspace`. But when I'm running tests to test my custom schematics it fails with error.\r\n\r\nPart of custom schematics code:\r\n```\r\nreturn (tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {\r\n    const workspaceConfigBuffer = tree.read('angular.json');\r\n    if (!workspaceConfigBuffer) {\r\n        throw new SchematicsException(\"Not an Angular CLI workspace\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const workspaceConfig = JSON.parse(workspaceConfigBuffer.toString());\r\n    const projectName = _options.project || workspaceConfig.defaultProject;\r\n      console.log(workspaceConfig);\r\n      const project = workspaceConfig.projects[projectName];\r\n\r\n    if (!_options.path) {\r\n        _options.path = buildDefaultPath(project); // Here method throw exception\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // some code below\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is how I'm creating workspace and application in tests:\r\n```\r\nconst coreOptions: {schema: StoreSchema, workspace: WorkspaceSchema, app: ApplicationSchema} = {\r\n  workspace: {\r\n    name: 'workspace',\r\n    newProjectRoot: 'projects',\r\n    version: '11.0.4'\r\n  },\r\n  app: {\r\n    name: 'th-schematics'\r\n  },\r\n  schema: {\r\n    name: 'Admin'\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(async () => {\r\n    appTree = await schematicRunner.runExternalSchematicAsync(\r\n        '@schematics/angular',\r\n        'workspace',\r\n        coreOptions.workspace\r\n    ).toPromise();\r\n    appTree = await schematicRunner.runExternalSchematicAsync(\r\n        '@schematics/angular',\r\n        'application',\r\n        coreOptions.app,\r\n        appTree\r\n    ).toPromise()\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I see from code, this method has next line of code `const projectDirName = project.extensions['projectType'] === workspace_models_1.ProjectType.Application ?

Spawn a flexible position based overlay.\r\n2. Make overlay contents height larger than viewport height such that overflow occurs.\r\n3. Make viewport height a floating point number with decimal portion between .0 to .5.\r\n4. The overlay will now overflow out of the viewport bounds.\r\n5. Make the viewport height a floating point number between .5 to next whole number, or a whole number.\r\n6. The overlay will now correctly stay within the viewport bounds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you just try slowly resizing the window height while the overlay is open, you will see it bounce in and out of the viewport as the window height cycles between bad and good numbers.\r\n \r\nProblem is that viewport height is a rounded number, and overlay height is a floating point. Therefore when viewport rounds down, the following check fails.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/e436479a7bef69b87e8954616a9e29a265a1a2b1/src/cdk/overlay/position/flexible-connected-position-strategy.ts#L632\r\n\r\nTo compare the two numbers, the rounding needs to be consistent.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFlexible dimension overlay should always remain within viewport bounds.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nFlexible dimension overlay does not remain within viewport bounds when viewport height rounds down.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.2.3\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21350","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CdkOverlay): CdkOverlay incorrectly calculates viewport bounds\" (#21350)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-12-17T05:30:04.939889Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2428}

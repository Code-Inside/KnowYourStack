E.g. in one worker, it may be the actual `.ts` file inside the source tree, while in the other, the file may be inside `blaze-out`.\r\n\r\nTsurge currently expects project relative paths to be passed around. Those project relative paths are currently only based on the single root directory. Hence paths inside `blaze-out` would actually not be recognizable.\r\n\r\nThe fix idea here is that we always respect root directories when computing a project relative path. Think of the computed path as the unique path you'd also get when importing from your project root. You'd always get to the same file.\r\n\r\nThis is perfect for passing between workers, assuming those are the same project; but just sub-compilation units. The root dirs are expected to *match*. This is a fine assumption in 1P and 3P; and guaranteed.\r\n\r\nOne risk I could see is that later on, when we write replacements for such a relative path in 3P, it may be possible that the file actually resides in an actual root directory and not in\r\n`<primaryRoot>/<relative-path>`. We should probably try to safely get back to the absolute path when writing replacements.

This mode can produce a fully client-side rendered (CSR) or static site generated (SSG) site. When SSG is enabled, redirects are handled using the `<meta>` tag.\r\n- `'server'`: Produces an application designed for deployment on a server that supports server-side rendering (SSR) or a hybrid approach.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `outputMode` option determines whether the new API is used. If enabled, it bundles the `server.ts` as a separate entry point, preventing it from directly referencing `main.server.ts` and excluding it from localization.\r\n\r\nIn the future, it is also being considered that this option will replace `appShell` and `prerendering` when server routing configuration is present.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28355","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/build): introduce `outputMode` option to the application builder\" (#28355)"},{"Id":"2506977470","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-05T08:44:43","Actor":"zmara","Number":"28354","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing rebuild logs","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17\n\n### Description\n\nDuring (serve) rebuild on save there used to be a log about information that the rebuild started, now there is none - only \"Compiled successfully\" when rebuild is done.\r\n\r\nWhy is that a problem? In large codebases the rebuild can take more time and it is important for a developer to see that he saved a file and the rebuild is happening so he needs to wait a moment in order to see changes he made. When there is no log, he will start questioning himself why the changes he made are not there. It is very important and informative log.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nLatest version of create-nx-workspace with Angular app\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nwebpack                         5.90.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nUsing @nx/angular: 19.6.4","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28354","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing rebuild logs\" (#28354)"},{"Id":"2506941176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-05T07:01:00","Actor":"BBboy01","Number":"28352","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/build): support custom postcss config","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

`sass-embedded` npm package.\n\n-   Fix an edge case where the Dart VM could hang when shutting down when requests\n    were in flight.\n\n-   Fix a race condition where the embedded host could fail

This configuration can lead to incorrect content being served, particularly in scenarios involving lazy-loaded modules or Angular routes with dots in their paths.\r\n\r\n### Current Problem:\r\n**1. Static File and SSR Route Handling:**\r\n\r\n* The server uses server.get('**', express.static(...)) and server.get('**', ...) for static files and SSR routes, respectively. This configuration causes every request to go through the static file middleware, including those intended for Angular SSR.\r\n* As a result, some routes can inadvertently serve the `index.html` file or other static assets, leading to incorrect `Content-Type` headers, especially for JavaScript files (e.g., lazy-loaded modules; the `main*.js` and `chunk*.js` files).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b0f9744-2440-4f9f-986e-4e3f4b9afa6f)\r\n(I cant show the response, but it's the `index.html` content)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7076e746-28cb-489f-ad5e-5e55291668ce)\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Lack of Distinction Between Static Files and Angular Routes:**\r\n\r\nRequests that are intended to be handled by Angular’s SSR engine may be incorrectly intercepted by the static file middleware if the requested path contains dots or other file-like patterns. This can result in unexpected behavior and incorrect content delivery.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution:\r\n**1. Static Files Middleware**\r\n\r\n* Original:\r\n```\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '**',\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: 'index.html',\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update to:\r\n```\r\n  server.get(\r\n    '*.*', // This ensures only files with extensions are served by express.static\r\n    express.static(browserDistFolder, {\r\n      maxAge: '1y',\r\n      index: false, // Do not look for index.html in the browserDistFolder\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2. SSR Middleware**\r\n\r\n* Original:\r\n```\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('**', (req, res, next) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update to:\r\n```\r\n  // All regular routes use the Angular engine\r\n  server.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\n* Static assets should be served with correct Content-Type headers.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badccd98-83a0-4b3d-a26f-3223472ee1b8)\r\n\r\n* Angular routes should be correctly handled by SSR, regardless of whether they contain dots or other special characters.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n> Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"text/html\".

Navigate back to Component B.\r\n\r\n### Observed Behavior:\r\n- Each time the above steps are repeated, a pair of detached elements (the host element of Component A and a `cdk-overlay` div) is created.\r\n- Repeating this process _N_ times results in _N_ pairs of detached elements.\r\n- Below is included a screen grab of Edge's _Detached Element_ development tool below for the case _N = 3_\r\n\r\n![detached_elements_edge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/580f3094-a27e-4074-9e87-6865277b5a20)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact:\r\n- While the memory impact may be minimal, it complicates debugging in complex applications due to the accumulation of small leaks.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n- Navigating between components and interacting with the `mat-select` should not result in any detached elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n- Each time the above steps are repeated, a pair of detached elements (the host element of Component A and a `cdk-overlay` div) is created.\r\n- Repeating this process N times results in N pairs of detached elements.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 18.2.3\r\nNode: 20.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.3\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, material, platform-browser, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.3\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29697","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Memory Leak in mat-select Component\" (#29697)"},{"Id":"2507105303","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-05T08:16:45","Actor":"jingglang","Number":"29696","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatMenu): Memory Leak in MatMenu and MatAutocomplete","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThere are detached elements in memory snapshot after clicking the menu or autocomplete to show the dropdowns.

Delete out the 'n' & the 'e' to be left with a filter of 'O'; note that the 'myControl.value' is still `One` (due to having set `requireSelection`)\r\n4. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c45088e-c38b-401a-ad4e-8d731fa00b20)\r\n5. Delete out the final 'O' from your filter; note that 'myControl.value' is again still `One`\r\n6. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec22ecc4-e027-4454-8d79-ebb3cda3d46f)\r\n7. In this context even though `myControl.value` is still `One` and `One` *is* visible in the list of options it is no longer marked as selected\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that when `myControl.value` matches a displayed option that option should be marked as selected. At least when `requireSelection=true`. \r\n\r\nFor `requireSelection=false` I would expect one of two options. Either it should snapshot the `myControl.value` on `open` for purposes of 'selected marking'; as is done for `requireSelection=true`. Or it should just update 'selected' according to the actual exact value of the underlying control. Overall the latter seems more in line with what is likely actually wanted (as the model *is* that option at that particular point in time). \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAs soon as the filter was reduced down to `''` (empty string) the 'selected' value ui markings are removed. \r\nThis same behavior also occurs if you add to your filter string to no longer include your element of selection in the options list and then revert to something that does. (Ie a filter of `One` -> `Onex` -> `One` will have caused your 'selected' element to have been unset)\r\n\r\nOnce removed the 'selected' highlight and checkmark in the ui seems to ONLY be able to fixed by reselecting an element.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be several related bugs such as\r\n[selection indicator broken with mat-optgroup ](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29189)\r\n[updates to the control not being reflected in selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27861)\r\n[initial form control values are not reflected on selection indicators](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29422)\r\n\r\nThis ticket is specifically about the causing the selection indicator ui to fail based on the editing of the filter but it seems likely that the same underlying library fix may apply to many if not all of these other tickets.\r\n\r\n### My current workarround\r\nI am identifying the option I want 'selected' 'manually' and styling it appropriately. If you go this route make sure to set `hideSingleSelectorIndicator` to true as you do not want to deal with library provided checkmark that sometimes (but not always) shows up.\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 126.0.6478.183\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29691","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Autocomplete): 'Selected' item is visually unset, even with the underlying control matching an option, due to filter editing\" (#29691)"},{"Id":"2505485383","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T14:08:36","Actor":"GiftLanga","Number":"29690","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): Add a boolean field to update the native …","State":"open","Body":"…input\r\n\r\nAdds the `updateNativeInput` field to the autocomplete trigger to update the native input element when the autocomplete is within a form field.\r\n\r\nFixes #29388.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29690","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): Add a boolean field to update the native …\" (#29690)"},{"Id":"2504966843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T10:42:16","Actor":"MaiGhoneim","Number":"29689","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" not working on table","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n8.2.3\n\n### Description\n\nwhen enabling drag and drop in angular material table from columns headers for reoreder columns, cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" do not working in angular 18 \r\ni attached my code in the following link:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-r6zvss?file=package.json\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-r6zvss?file=package.json\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. trying to drag any column header\r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nwhen dragging column header should be drag and drop only horizontail and in x direction\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\ncolumn header drag and drop to everywhere\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29689","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cdkDropListLockAxis=\"x\" cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" not working on table\" (#29689)"},{"Id":"2504621459","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-04T08:14:12","Actor":"iFederx","Number":"29687","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-tab): mat tab content not visible if tab is switched during animation of parent div","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIf you have a div animated that contains a mat-tab-group and you change tab during parent div's animation, the tab content will be invisible.\r\nLast version tested: angular 16.2.1.

Hence hiding the focussed element from assistive technology and throwing this error. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows, macOS\r\n![Uploading Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 12.55.54 PM.png…]()\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29682","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): Dialog launched from a menu\" (#29682)"},{"Id":"2498693428","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T15:07:01","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29674","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/tooltip): remove old IE workaround","State":"closed","Body":"Removes a workaround for an IE bug that is no longer necessary.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29674","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/tooltip): remove old IE workaround\" (#29674)"},{"Id":"2500419964","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-03T15:06:05","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29678","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/a11y): use native media query for high contrast detection","State":"closed","Body":"Changes the `cdk.high-contrast` mixin to use a native media query instead of a custom CSS classes.

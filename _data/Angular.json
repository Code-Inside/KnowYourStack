subsystem","State":"open","Body":"In 2017 (#18284), it was chosen to drop the `Intl` API in favor of custom i18N data extracted from the CLDR (`@angular/common/locales/...`. \r\n\r\nSince then the `Intl` API has matured a lot and is now able to cover the feature provided by the framework. \r\n\r\nReplacing the legacy i18n implementation with the `Intl` API is move to shift the localisation responsability from the framework to the platform (browsers, Node or Cloud workers). \r\n\r\n### Benefits of switching to an `Intl` implementation\r\nReplacing the legacy implementation with data from locale files with the an `Intl` based implementation has several benefits. \r\n* No need to import locale files to add support for additional languages (default was only english) \r\n* Bundle size improvements\r\n* Support for extended locales which allow specifying numbering system, calendar extension etc (ie `fa-AF-u-nu-latn` specifies  Persian, Afghanistan,Western Digits).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations \r\nThis will lead to the deprecation of the following locale getters : \r\n\r\n* `getCurrencySymbol(code: string, format: 'wide' | 'narrow', locale?: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleCurrencyCode(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleCurrencyName(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleCurrencySymbol(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleDateFormat(locale: string, width: FormatWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleDateTimeFormat(locale: string, width: FormatWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleDayNames(locale: string, formStyle: FormStyle, width: TranslationWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleDayPeriods(locale: string, formStyle: FormStyle, width: TranslationWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleDirection(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleEraNames(locale: string, width: TranslationWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleExtraDayPeriodRules(locale: string): (Time | [Time, Time])`\r\n* `getLocaleExtraDayPeriods(locale: string, formStyle: FormStyle, width: TranslationWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleFirstDayOfWeek(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleId(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleMonthNames(locale: string, formStyle: FormStyle, width: TranslationWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleNumberFormat(locale: string, type: NumberFormatStyle)`\r\n* `getLocaleNumberSymbol(locale: string, symbol: NumberSymbol)`\r\n* `getLocalePluralCase: (locale: string) => (value: number)`\r\n* `getLocaleTimeFormat(locale: string, width: FormatWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleWeekEndRange(locale: string)`\r\n* `getNumberOfCurrencyDigits(code: string)`\r\n\r\nThose functions, barring exceptions mentioned below, should be replacing by using the `Intl` API with `Intl.formatNumber`, `Intl.formatDate`, `Intl.Plural`. \r\n\r\n#### Getters with none/partial replacements : \r\n\r\n* `getLocaleWeekEndRange` & `getLocaleFirstDayOfWeek` : [`Intl.getWeekInfo()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/getWeekInfo) not supported by Firefox (122 ATM) \r\n* * Alternatives\r\n* * * [`luxon`](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs) falls back to the ISO week definition (starts on monday, 4 days in week for the week year). \r\n* * * [`day.js`](https://day.js.org/docs/en/i18n/i18n) Provides locale data for `yearStart` and `weekStart` but not the weekend range\r\n* * * [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/v3.3.1/docs) Provides locale data `weekStartsOn` & `firstWeekContainsDate` but not the weekend range.\r\n*  `getLocaleDirection` : [`Intl.getTextInfo()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/getTextInfo) not supported by Firefox (122 ATM)\r\n* * Alternative : [`rtl-detect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtl-detect) \r\n* `getLocaleCurrencySymbol`/`getLocaleCurrencyCode`: We recommend developers fully drop this function as currencies shouldn’t be determined from a locale. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Rolout plan\r\nThe feature will be enabled by default for new projects and opt-out on existing project when migrated with `ng update`. \r\n\r\nSchedule TBD. \r\n\r\n###

Unfortunately there is no option in angular at the moment to reach this goal, so all the logic must be applied before starting the building process. Also multiple html files make the project more complex. It would be better to have a preprocessor (like in C or other languages) to mark an area in the html template to be used if a compiler flag was set or some environment variable was set. One html template can contain html code for several different CSS/HTML Libraries.\r\n\r\nWhy a preprocessor step? I can also achieve the same by setting a global variable and some *ngIf statements in the html. But those logic + additional html for all CSS/HTML Libraries will be stored in the final product and generates an unnecessary overhead.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroducing variables which are considered at compile time, to include / not include parts of the html template. Those variables must be global or can be configured in the angular.json as an option like:\r\n\r\n\"preprocessorMacro\": {\"htmllib\":\"bootstrap4\"}\r\n\r\nin another project\r\n\r\n\"preprocessorMacro\": {\"htmllib\":\"bootstrap5\"}\r\n\r\nand used in the html template (example can be different)\r\n\r\n<ng-macro #htmllib_bootstrap4>\r\n\r\nmy bootstrap 4 widgets\r\n\r\n</ng-macro>\r\n<ng-macro #htmllib_bootstrap5>\r\n\r\nmy bootstrap 5 widgets\r\n\r\n</ng-macro>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEnhance the optimizier, to remove parts of the html which are not used at all. For example, a const global variable which will never change and set to value like \"bootstrap4\" / \"bootstrap5\" must be considered.\r\n\r\nIssues / Problems: Global variables can't be used in html templates and must be re-defined in components. The variable in the component is not a global variable anymore.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27123","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for multiple CSS Frameworks / Partial Build depends on Environment Variables\" (#27123)"},{"Id":"2138589816","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T13:04:39","Actor":"gingters","Number":"27119","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve / ng build does not work on Windows dev drive mounted as a volume","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler-cli, compiler\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI'm on Windows 11, using a [dev drive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/) ( `D:` ).

It can run the build step before jest runs. This allows us to run  `jest --runInBand` ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to add a `--runInBand` ng test flag for jest.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've currently invented a workaround. Unfortunately, without a proper `ng test --build` command, I had to revert to `ng test || exit 0`. This will build _and run the tests once_ before debugging can start. The necessary `sourceMapPathOverrides` are hideous as well 🙈\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>launch.json</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n  \"configurations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"ng test (jest)\",\r\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n      \"preLaunchTask\": \"npm: test:build\",\r\n      \"runtimeArgs\": [\r\n        \"--experimental-vm-modules\",\r\n        \"./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js\",\r\n        \"--runInBand\",\r\n        \"--rootDir\",\r\n        \"${workspaceFolder}/dist/test-out/browser\",\r\n        \"--testMatch\",\r\n        \"**/?(*.)+(spec|test).mjs\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"skipFiles\": [\"<node_internals>/**\"],\r\n      \"type\": \"node\",\r\n      \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\r\n        \"src/app/*\": \"${workspaceFolder}/src/app/*\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"outputCapture\": \"std\",\r\n      \"outFiles\": [\"${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.mjs\"]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>package.json</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\r\n    \"test:build\": \"npm test || exit 0\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</summary>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to debug jest tests?\" (#27117)"},{"Id":"2138549250","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T12:41:15","Actor":"sod","Number":"27116","RawContent":null,"Title":"`externalPackagesPlugin` slows down `ng serve` substantially","State":"open","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [x] Kinda, as the `externalPackagesPlugin` was just added via https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26923\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26923 existed, which was part of [17.1.1](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/17.1.1), so I guess angular [17.1.0](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/17.1.0)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nangular 17.2.0\r\nvite/esbuild powered application builder\r\n\r\nUsing the `loader` option in `angular.json` like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\", \".svg\": \"text\" },\r\n```\r\n\r\nto support images as ecmascript imports or svgs as inline. This causes angular-cli to add the `externalPackagesPlugin` which is a giant hit on build performance. For our apps:\r\n\r\n| angular version | watch rebuild time |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| angular 17.1.0 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `0.8 seconds` |\r\n| angular 17.1.1 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `6.0 seconds` |\r\n| angular 17.2.0 `{ \"loader\": { \".webp\": \"file\" } }` | `6.0 seconds` |\r\n\r\nThose additional 5.2 seconds are also added to the initial build.\r\n\r\nMy rough idea of the issue is, that the `externalPackagesPlugin` looks at every single import that doesn't start with `.` or `/` and doesn't cache the results. So tons of `@angular/...`, `rxjs`, `@ngrx/...` and similar imports are resolved over and over again. Even if this function only needs 2ms to run, this quickly adds up.\r\n\r\n### Minimal

importers, see [the\nannouncement][pkg-importers] on the Sass blog.\n\n[pkg-importers]: https://sass-lang.com/blog/announcing-pkg-importers\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n-   Add a `--pkg-importer` flag to enable built-in `pkg:` importers. Currently\n    this only supports the Node.js package resolution algorithm, via\n    `--pkg-importer=node`. For example, `@use \"pkg:bootstrap\"` will load\n    `node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss`.\n\n##### JavaScript API\n\n-   Add a `NodePackageImporter` importer that can be passed to the `importers`\n    option. This loads files using the `pkg:` URL scheme according to the Node.js\n    package resolution algorithm. For example, `@use \"pkg:bootstrap\"` will load\n    `node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss`. The constructor takes a single\n    optional argument, which indicates the base directory to use when locating\n    `node_modules` directories. It defaults to\n    `path.dirname(require.main.filename)`.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add a `NodePackageImporter` importer that can be passed to the `importers`\n    option.

Webpack is loading the normal sass styles.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be really cool if the webpack condition is matched.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could offer a scss variable so that consumers can override the font path or just casually export the file. This still does not solve the problem when using esbuild and the karma runner but at least they could do something.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how much effort it is fixing this, but in case you just need to add `webpack` here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/styles.ts#L382 it would be really cool if you could do it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27100","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"respect wepack export condition for importing\" (#27100)"},{"Id":"2133906230","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-14T15:56:48","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27098","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support string as plugin option in custom postcss plugin config","State":"closed","Body":"In certain cases, the plugin option may be a string value, as shown in the example below:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n \"plugins\": {\r\n  \"tailwindcss/nesting\": \"postcss-nesting\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#nesting","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27098","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support string as plugin option in custom postcss plugin config\" (#27098)"},{"Id":"2133617389","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-14T09:32:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27096","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.24.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.24.0` -> `v3.24.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.24.1`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.0...v3.24.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.0...v3.24.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Specifically, when users attempt to scroll through the options presented in the autocomplete dropdown, the scroll action unexpectedly affects the underlying webpage instead of the dropdown list. This behavior disrupts the user's ability to select an option from the autocomplete list and significantly impacts the usability of the component. The issue has been consistently observed across a variety of devices and web browsers, indicating a broader compatibility or event handling problem within the component.\r\n\r\nVideo Demonstration of the Issue:\r\nhttps://javamaniac.github.io/angular-autocomplete-example/screen-20240212-143204.mp4\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/javamaniac/angular-autocomplete-example\r\n\r\nThe issue with mat-autocomplete scrolling is intermittent and does not have a consistent reproduction sequence. However, it generally involves interactions with the autocomplete component on a mobile device. Below are steps that have sometimes led to the issue, though it may require repeating certain actions or experimenting with the sequence to observe the problem.\r\n\r\nPotential Reproduction Sequences:\r\n\r\nBasic Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nExtended Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Select any option from the list.\r\n3. Clear the selected option (erase the choice).\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options again.\r\n\r\nExternal Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Click outside the dropdown to close it.\r\n3. Re-open the dropdown.\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nNote: The issue may not manifest on the first attempt and could require varying the sequence of actions, such as selecting and clearing choices multiple times or opening and closing the dropdown before scrolling attempts are made. The problem appears to be more likely to occur after interacting with the dropdown in some way (selecting options, erasing choices, or clicking outside the dropdown) before attempting to scroll through the options again.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDragging (scrolling) within the mat-autocomplete dropdown should scroll through the autocomplete options.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAttempting to scroll through the autocomplete options results in the page itself scrolling.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16, 17 (issue likely affects older versions as well)\r\n- CDK/Material: 16, 17\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Edge, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android, iOS\r\n\r\nDevices tested:\r\n- Google Pixel 6 (Chrome, Edge)\r\n- iPhone SE (Chrome, Safari)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28581","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/autocomplete): Intermittent Scrolling Issue with mat-autocomplete on Mobile Devices\" (#28581)"},{"Id":"2130777176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T19:32:53","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28580","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/list): fix m3 demo trailing icon color","State":"closed","Body":"Fix trailing icon color in M3 List demo.

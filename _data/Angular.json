We were able to build the `coreLibs` without problems and install them into the `userApp` as well. `ng serve` on the `userApp` works as well. But when we tried to build the `userLibs` we encounter following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: Cannot resolve type entity i4.CommonModule to symbol\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: Cannot resolve type entity i4.CommonModule to symbol\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe were able to solve some of these errors by removing imported modules in ngModules that were not necessary. But sadly, we couldn't solve all the issues.\r\n\r\nWe still don't understand why this error occurs only with ivy and what it actually means.\r\n\r\n**Second Problem**\r\n\r\nWe then tried to build the libraries without ivy but still run the application with ivy.\r\n\r\nThis way we were able to build the `userLibs`  without problems. But when we tried to `ng serve` following error occurs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in the target entry-point \"coreLibB\" has missing dependecies:\r\n - @angular/localize/init\r\n - @angular/cdk/platform\r\n - rxjs/operators\r\n - coreLibA\r\n ... and some more\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe tried to work around that by adding hard dependencies in the libraries package.json and whitelist them in the ng-package.json. That worked, but npm install ran out of memory. So this is not a solution either.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nIt seems that Ivy is much stricter that View Engine. But we need Ivy to use the new localization feature of angular 10.\r\n\r\nSo we would really appreciate help with this problem. We know that we probably didn't provide enough information, but we just don't know what information is needed. So just let us know and we deliver.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39282","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problems with enabling Ivy in Angular 10\" (#39282)"},{"Id":"721983511","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-15T05:14:42","Actor":"Hasnat150822","Number":"39281","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular pipes and directives could not be used as a global state for all modules?","State":"open","Body":"To use Pipes & Directives in all lazy loaded module, I have used shared module in which I import and export these pipes.\r\nI think this is not good approach because if there are many pipes & directives then a module will use all these pipes even some of them is not needed.\r\nHere is the link of my code.\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angulattesting?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcustom-pipes%2Freturn-dash.pipe.ts\r\nSo, I think there should be a global way to handle this just like angular global state management.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39281","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular pipes and directives could not be used as a global state for all modules?\" (#39281)"},{"Id":"721961086","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-15T04:23:48","Actor":"dev054","Number":"39280","RawContent":null,"Title":"Better ngClass typings","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n`@angular/common`.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nIn ng < 9, the type was `any` so it worked.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5db7b4c354d812938aa247a18154d6a61948547c/packages/common/src/directives/ng_class.ts#L61\r\n\r\nActually we can't pass readonly arrays or readonly sets with `strictTemplates` enabled, because the current types don't support it.\r\nAnother thing that is really trivial is that we can't use right now it with `| async`, as it could return `null | undefined` and it's also not supported.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.6\r\nNode: 13.7.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.6\r\n@angular/cdk                    10.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.6\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.6\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.6\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.3\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39280","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better ngClass typings\" (#39280)"},{"Id":"721921296","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-15T02:30:45","Actor":"jrwiegand","Number":"39279","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: clarify grammatical error","State":"open","Body":"The sentence is grammatically incorrect.

We have investigated and found that one particular component is now taking too much time to compile (10 minutes and more). \r\n\r\nIt started on @angular/compiler-cli 10.1.0 With this version an app with only one component takes ~3 minutes to compile. With @angular/compiler-cli 10.0.14 the build takes ~20 seconds to complete.\r\n\r\nThe issue is reproducible with `fullTemplateTypeCheck`: true and `strictNullChecks`: true.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://github.com/x87/ng10bug\r\n\r\nRun `yarn build` and observe build time. Then change `strictNullChecks` to `true` in `tsconfig.json` and re-run `yarn build`.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.6\r\nNode: 12.18.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.5\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.1001.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               10.1.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         10.1.6\r\n@angular/cli                       10.1.6\r\n@schematics/angular                10.1.6\r\n@schematics/update                 0.1001.6\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         4.0.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39274","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Regression in compiler-cli 10.1.0+: build is 10x times slower\" (#39274)"},{"Id":"721697884","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-14T19:59:34","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"39272","RawContent":null,"Title":"Patch backport of #38959 & #39267","State":"closed","Body":"Patch backport of #38959 & #39267","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39272","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Patch backport of #38959 & #39267\" (#39272)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"722909407","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T05:11:27","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"19096","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update rollup to version 2.31.0","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup)) | dependencies | minor | [`2.30.0` -> `2.31.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/2.30.0/2.31.0) |\n| [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup)) | devDependencies | minor | [`2.30.0` -> `2.31.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/2.30.0/2.31.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup</summary>\n\n### [`v2.31.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;2310)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v2.30.0...v2.31.0)\n\n_2020-10-15_\n\n##### Features\n\n-   When using the `output.moduleToStringTag` option, also add the tag to entries with exports and simulated external namespaces ([#&#8203;3822](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3822))\n-   Add the `__esModule` interop marker to IIFE global variables unless `output.esModule` is turned off ([#&#8203;3822](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3822))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;3822](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3822): Add module toStringTag to entries and interop namespaces ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

And nothing helped. I think it's not a duplicate. Because in short: I followed the recommended config (no ts-files in \"include\", entry \"files\" only). But this does not fully work and also disables intellisense. ...\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nI think this is since Angular 9, 10, 11.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI get some warnings about unused ts-files. Even if I remove all \"included\" of ts-files and only use entry \"files\".\r\nAnd over this, I need the includes for the autocompletion / auto-import suggestion / IntelliSense.\r\n\r\nWithout `**/*.ts` in `include` of `ts.config`, there are less warnings. But for some files like the prod.ts the problem persists.\r\nAnd without this include, I have no autocomplete anymore. This is no solution for me.\r\n\r\nWhat is this warning? What's the problem to have this \"unused\" files. Those files are included in the build?\r\nAnyway, I cannot remove all warnings about it and cannot use autocomplete if includes are not set. ...\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Build a monorepo (in my case).\r\n2. Call `ng build`.\r\n3. Get the warning/s about unused ts-files.\r\n4. Checkout the `tsconfig` files. Ensure the there is no `**/*.ts` as suggested. Use entry `files` only.\r\n5. Go to `apps\\demo-app\\src\\app\\pages\\dashboard\\dashboard.page.ts` and  test the autocompletion with `sayHello`.\r\n6. Find out that the autocompletion only works when `src/**/*.ts` and `../../shared/**/*.ts` are set in `tsconfig.app.ts`.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter if the include of ts-files is correct or not:\r\n1. You cannot remove all warnings with this suggestion config.\r\n2. You drop the autocompletion if you follow the suggestion.\r\n\r\n**[Download Demo-Project](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/5383307/test-demo.zip)**\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nWarning: ...\\test-demo\\apps\\demo-app\\src\\environments\\environment.prod.ts is part of the TypeScript compilation but it's unused.\r\nAdd only entry points to the 'files' or 'include' properties in your tsconfig.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThe file `environment.prod.ts` is not the only one in the warnings, on a more complex project.\r\n\r\n**tsconfig.json**\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"files\": [\"src/main.ts\", \"src/polyfills.ts\"],\r\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*d.ts\", \"../../shared/**/*d.ts\"],\r\n  \"exclude\": [\"src/**/*.spec.ts\", \"../../shared/**/*.spec.ts\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDown-side: No autocompletion.

([#&#8203;39102](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39102)) ([049b453](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/049b453)), closes [#&#8203;39082](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39082)\n-   **core:** use Trusted Types policy in inert DOM builder ([#&#8203;39208](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39208))

([#&#8203;38882](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38882)) ([4a1c12c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4a1c12c))\n-   **language-service:** [Ivy] getSemanticDiagnostics for external templates ([#&#8203;39065](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39065)) ([63624a2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/63624a2))\n-   **language-service:** Add getTypeDefinitionAtPosition (go to type definition) ([#&#8203;39145](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39145)) ([a84976f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/a84976f))\n-

**router:** add new initialNavigation options to replace legacy ([#&#8203;37480](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37480)) ([c4becca](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c4becca))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **router:** \\* The `initialNavigation` property for the options in\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` no longer supports `legacy_disabled`,\n    `legacy_enabled`, `true`, or `false` as valid values.\n    `legacy_enabled` (the old default) is instead `enabledNonBlocking`\n-   `enabled` is deprecated as a valid value for the\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` `initialNavigation` option. `enabledBlocking`\n    has been introduced to replace it\n-   **router:** preserveQueryParams has been removed, use\n    queryParamsHandling=\"preserve\" instead\n-   **router:**  If you were accessing the `RouterLink` values of `queryParams`,\n    `fragment` or `queryParamsHandling` you might need to relax the typing to also\n    accept `undefined` and `null`. ([#&#8203;39151](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39151))\n-   **core:** \\* `ViewEncapsulation.Native` has been removed. Use `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom` instead. Existing\n    usages will be updated automatically by `ng update`.\n-   **compiler-cli:** Expressions within ICUs are now type-checked again, fixing a regression\n    in Ivy. This may cause compilation failures if errors are found in\n    expressions that appear within an ICU. Please correct these expressions\n    to resolve the type-check errors.\n\n#### 10.1.6 (2020-10-14)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler:** incorrectly encapsulating [@&#8203;import](https://togithub.com/import) containing colons and semicolons ([#&#8203;38716](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38716))

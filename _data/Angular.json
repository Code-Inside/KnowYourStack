Moreover, some pipelines are triggered by a combination of inputs responding to change in any of them.\r\n\r\nThe simplest use case looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-movie'\r\n})\r\nexport class MovieComponent implements OnDestroy {\r\n  private readonly id$ = new ReplaySubject<string>(1);\r\n\r\n  @Input()\r\n  set id(value: string) {\r\n    this.id$.next(value);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  readonly movie$ = this.id$.pipe(switchMap(id => this.collection.find(id)));\r\n  \r\n  constructor(\r\n    private readonly collection: MovieCollection,\r\n  ) {}\r\n  \r\n  ngOnDestroy() {\r\n    this.id$.complete();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to get input as a stream of changes, we have to \r\n\r\n1. Add property containing some `Subject`, typically `ReplaySubject` for inputs without initial value or `BehaviorSubject` for inputs with an initial value;\r\n2. Use setter for input property and push `next` value to that `Subject`;\r\n3. Don't forget to clean up - implement `OnDestroy` and `complete` the `Subject`.\r\n4. Repeat for every input of such kind.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe solution to this problem is to allow using `Subject`s as input values:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-movie'\r\n})\r\nexport class MovieComponent {\r\n  @Input()\r\n  readonly id = new ReplaySubject<number>(1);\r\n  \r\n  readonly movie$ = this.id.pipe(switchMap(id => this.collection.find(id)));\r\n  \r\n  constructor(\r\n    private readonly collection: MovieCollection,\r\n  ) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, any object implementing [`NextObserver`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/interface/NextObserver) should be a legit value. Implementing [`CompletionObserver`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/interface/CompletionObserver) should be optional.\r\n\r\nSuch inputs' `Subject`s must be completed automatically when the component/directive is destroyed.\r\n\r\nIs may also require a special syntax for such sort of inputs:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<app-movie {id}=\"123\"></app-movie>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative may include the usage of a special implementation of `Subject`, like `EventEmitter` for outputs:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-movie'\r\n})\r\nexport class MovieComponent {\r\n  @Input()\r\n  readonly id = new InputSubject<number>(/* optional initial value */);\r\n  \r\n  readonly movie$ = this.id.pipe(switchMap(id => this.collection.find(id)));\r\n  \r\n  constructor(\r\n    private readonly collection: MovieCollection,\r\n  ) {}\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46730","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Observable (Subject-like) inputs for components and directives\" (#46730)"},{"Id":"1297670276","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-07T20:52:38","Actor":"dario-piotrowicz","Number":"46738","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(animations): add section about animations and view encapsulation","State":"closed","Body":"Add a section regarding component view encapsulations in the complex animation\r\nsequences guide to let developers know how animations work in regard to\r\nview encapsulations.\r\n\r\nThis section is used to both add information to the guide but also to\r\ntake a stand on how the animations should behave in regard to the\r\nshadow dom view encapsulation.\r\n\r\nThis relates to PR #46488 which by trying to make sure the query\r\nfunction works with shadow dom elements proved that having the\r\nanimations implementation work with shadow dom would increase the\r\ncomplexity of the code and would have a negative impact on performance,\r\nsuch facts alongide the small adoption of shadow dom by users influenced\r\nthe decision to keep the current functionalities and simply discourage\r\nthe use of animations and shadow dom components.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is deprecated in favor of\r\nGoogle Analytics 4 and UA will stop processing hits in October 2023.\r\n\r\nThis change intends to prepare us for this migration, and to already\r\npre-populate our GA4 property (there is no way to migrate existing data\r\n/properties into a GA4 property -- a new one needs to be created).\r\n\r\nThis will help us minimize the data gap so that we can:\r\n\r\n* Continue to look at the UA property with the full time span until\r\n  October 2023\r\n* Can start using the GA4 property long-term in the future, starting\r\n  with data even before Universal Analytics stops processing new data.\r\n\r\nWe need to keep the existing `analytics.js` setup. Initially we have\r\nconsidered using `gtag.js` for both the UA and GA4 properties, as it\r\nsupports that, but that doesn't work with our strict trusted types\r\nenforcement because it results in multiple `gtag.js` scripts (specific\r\nversions for UA or GA4) that recreate the same trusted type policies.\r\nThis causes runtime errors and breaks the setup.\r\n\r\nInstead, with continued use of `analytics.js` we have the benefit of\r\na good separation of trusted types + events and configuration. There is\r\nsome problematic with translation of Universal Analytics Events to GA4,\r\nor the other way around (even though we don't use custom events\r\ncurrently)\r\n\r\nWe also do not need to send page views for our GA4 property because GA4\r\nwith gtag supports this automatically (respecting the history state --\r\nusing the `Enhanced measurement events` setting in the UI).\r\nFor our UA legacy instance we continue to dispatch events manually.

The situation is the following: we make a build and deploy it, some customers use the website and in this process cache the JS files. We make some changes to the codebase and then one week later we make another build and deploy it. One of the JS files in the new bundle has the same content hash (and file name) but a different intergrity hash. This leads to customers complaining about bugs, because the browser still has the file cached from the old build, but since the integrity hash is different (and we don't cache the `index.html` file) the integrity check fails as the cached JS file from the old build is hashed against the integrity hash from the new build, which causes the browser to block the JS file.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we can't reproduce this behavior, when we try to locally build the same commit hashes that were deployed, the contents of the JS files of the two builds are identical. In the last case the JS file from the old build always included an exception variable in the catch blocks (`} catch (n) {`), while the new build omitted them (`} catch {`) with everything else being equal (we also didn't change any dependencies or configuration). Since we can't reproduce it I can't open a bug for this, but this is a big issue for us.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `outputHashing` can only be configured to generate a content hash. If it was possible to configure `outputHashing` to always create unique file names on every build, while it would not fix the underlying issue, it would resolve the problem, since when deploying a new build we could be sure the browsers would not already have a cached file with the same name and the file would not be blocked from execution as the integrity check wouldn't fail.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd another configuration option next to `outputHashing` which would allow to define whether the file names generated as part of `outputHashing` should be based on the file content (current behavior, default) or be unique with each build (new).\r\n\r\nTo ensure the file names are unique per build, one option would be adding an epoch timestamp to the filenames, either in replacement of the content hashes or additional to them. So the file names would look something like this `main.1657103379.js` or `main.eaf4225277726a91.1657103379.js`. Another option would be to include an epoch timestamp / randomness when calculating the content hash.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be fixing the underlying issue, as that would also fix the problem. But as I mentioned the issue is not reproducible and very sporadic. Seeing there are quite a lot of issues already here on this topic but no one so far has been able to make it reproducible I don't think it's likely this is a viable solution, unless someone from reading the issue description of the differently written catch clauses knows what the issue is.\r\n\r\nA workaround would be for us to do the same as described in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10641#issuecomment-517290830 to add a post build script which would manually transform the file names to include the timestamp. But this would be quite a brittle solution, as it could break at any point, should Angular introduce changes in the way the files are built or named.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23510","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unique content hash per build\" (#23510)"},{"Id":"1295491355","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T09:41:03","Actor":"Srikor","Number":"23509","RawContent":null,"Title":"--base-href does not modify the path of script files in index.html","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncompiler, Don't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nPer angular documents for ng build command, deployUrl is deprecated and  the --base-href option should be used.

[`v0.14.48`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01448)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.47...v0.14.48)\n\n-   Enable using esbuild in Deno via WebAssembly ([#&#8203;2323](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2323))\n\n    The native implementation of esbuild is much faster than the WebAssembly version, but some people don't want to give Deno the `--allow-run` permission necessary to run esbuild and are ok waiting longer for their builds to finish when using the WebAssembly backend. With this release, you can now use esbuild via WebAssembly in Deno. To do this you will need to import from `wasm.js` instead of `mod.js`:\n\n    ```js\n    import * as esbuild from 'https://deno.land/x/esbuild@v0.14.48/wasm.js'\n    const ts = 'let test: boolean = true'\n    const result = await esbuild.transform(ts, { loader: 'ts' })\n    console.log('result:', result)\n    ```\n\n    Make sure you run Deno with `--allow-net` so esbuild can download the WebAssembly module. Using esbuild like this starts up a worker thread that runs esbuild in parallel (unless you call `esbuild.initialize({ worker: false })` to tell esbuild to run on the main thread). If you want to, you can call `esbuild.stop()` to terminate the worker if you won't be using esbuild anymore and you want to reclaim the memory.\n\n    Note that Deno appears to have a bug where background WebAssembly optimization can prevent the process from exiting for many seconds. If you are trying to use Deno and WebAssembly to run esbuild quickly, you may need to manually call `Deno.exit(0)` after your code has finished running.\n\n-   Add support for font file MIME types ([#&#8203;2337](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2337))\n\n    This release adds support for font file MIME types to esbuild, which means they are now recognized by the built-in local web server and they are now used when a font file is loaded using the `dataurl` loader. The full set of newly-added file extension MIME type mappings is as follows:\n\n    -   `.eot` => `application/vnd.ms-fontobject`\n    -   `.otf` => `font/otf`\n    -   `.sfnt` => `font/sfnt`\n    -   `.ttf` => `font/ttf`\n    -   `.woff` => `font/woff`\n    -   `.woff2` => `font/woff2`\n\n-   Remove `\"use strict\";` when targeting ESM ([#&#8203;2347](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2347))\n\n    All ES module code is automatically in strict mode, so a `\"use strict\";` directive is unnecessary. With this release, esbuild will now remove the `\"use strict\";` directive if the output format is ESM. This change makes the generated output file a few bytes smaller:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    'use strict'\n    export let foo = 123\n\n    // Old output (with --format=esm --minify)\n    \"use strict\";let t=123;export{t as foo};\n\n    // New output (with --format=esm --minify)\n    let t=123;export{t as foo};\n    ```\n\n-   Attempt to have esbuild work with Deno on FreeBSD ([#&#8203;2356](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2356))\n\n    Deno doesn't support FreeBSD, but it's possible to build Deno for FreeBSD with some additional patches on top. This release of esbuild changes esbuild's Deno installer to download esbuild's FreeBSD binary in this situation. This configuration is unsupported although in theory everything should work.\n\n-   Add some more target JavaScript engines ([#&#8203;2357](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2357))\n\n    This release adds the [Rhino](https://togithub.com/mozilla/rhino) and [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) JavaScript engines to the set of engine identifiers that can be passed to the `--target` flag. You can use this to restrict esbuild to only using JavaScript features that are supported on those engines in the output files that esbuild generates.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.19.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.19.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.18.0...v8.19.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`7023628`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/7023628eb3af1bcc0151afab2bf617217fae51b1) feat: add importNames support for patterns in no-restricted-imports ([#&#8203;16059](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16059)) (Brandon Scott)\n-   [`472c368`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/472c3681364833f697d726abc3c33fbe2663eeb7) feat: fix handling of blockless `with` statements in indent rule ([#&#8203;16068](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16068)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`fc81848`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/fc81848238ee0f6ff93615875ea4b8e95dc09249) fix: throw helpful exception when rule has wrong return type ([#&#8203;16075](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16075)) (Bryan Mishkin)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`3ae0574`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/3ae0574fc78c4a2b406625e4792cb2859cb9bcb1) docs: Remove duplicate rule descriptions ([#&#8203;16052](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16052)) (Amaresh  S M)\n-   [`f50cf43`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f50cf436aaa5dff1273f4753dd3fc6782f95a045) docs: Add base href to each page to fix relative URLs ([#&#8203;16046](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16046)) (Nicholas C.

We come from three projects that rely on parse5 — namely [Cheerio](https://togithub.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), [rehype](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype), and [Lit](https://lit.dev/).\n\n**We need your support to continue the project!** If you care about parse5, please support us financially on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/parse5).\n\nHeadlining features of this release are ES Modules, TypeScript, and performance improvements: 7.0.0 is 45% faster than 6.0.1 with default options, and 167% faster with location information enabled (for the `bench/perf` benchmark, on an M1 Mac). Version 7.0.0 is a revamp of every part of the library. There are too many changes to list them all here, so here is a high-level overview:\n\n##### Breaking: ESM\n\nAll of parse5’s packages are now ECMAScript Modules. We are providing dual packages for `parse5` and `parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter` for now (see [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418) and [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496)).\n\nTo migrate, please read [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) on how to update. Note that private internals are no longer available; instead, everything that you need should be imported from the main package.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j) in [#&#8203;351](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/351)*\n\n##### Breaking: TypeScript\n\nThe codebase has been ported to TypeScript. This helped uncover a number of subtle logic bugs, such as [`dc4e269`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/dc4e269022ebbae0767d8f790a29d6be1835fe1e), [`b4b5d4a`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/b4b5d4ad6f90b3c9fd03a90e2ed5267929979a11), or [`a0aff95`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/a0aff9578bb44511bc169c1d7f9e2f2780f7f8a0). TypeScript also helps us refactor with confidence and a lot of the changes in this release would have been much harder to do without it.\n\nTo migrate, please remove `@types/parse5*` as we now ship our own types.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;fb55](https://togithub.com/fb55) in [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362)*\n\n##### Potentially breaking changes\n\n-   parse5 was caught up with the HTML spec, and parsing results might differ in edge-cases ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451))\n-   The `parse5-serializer-stream` package was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481)\n    -   To migrate, use the `serialize` function exported by `parse5`.\n-   The rewriting stream now splits very long text sections ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434)) and doesn’t escape text in special tags anymore ([#&#8203;434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/434)). If you worked around these issues before, you might have to update your code.\n-   The htmlparser2 adapter now uses `domhandler`’s node interface ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327) by [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound))\n    -   The format of the tree nodes has changed slightly; eg. some previous properties are now getters and setters, and vice versa.\n\nIf you are using deep imports for any parts of the codebase, you will likely encounter some breakages:\n\n<details><summary>Show internal changes</summary>\n\n-   The tokenizer now uses the state machine pattern from htmlparser2 [`5d7a780` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/5d7a780b70d3669def4c6bb20cbec816804d44a5)\n-   The token queue was replaced with callbacks ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419))\n-   The `OpenElementStack` now uses callbacks [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429)\n-   Mixins were removed (as part of [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362))\n    -   Location tracking now has a substantially lower overhead [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402)\n-   `getNextToken` was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461)\n-   The parser’s `_bootstrap` method was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384)\n-   We now drop chunks from the tokenizer right after they are emitted [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432)\n-   The serializer is no longer a class; instead, different serializer functions call on each other [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383)\n-   parse5 now uses the `entities` module for encoding and decoding entities, sharing maintenance & optimisation work with projects such as htmlparser2 ([`2b92054` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/2b9205458b9305de1406966568567ccfc1633fa1), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486))\n    -   `entities` adopted a variant of parse5’s approach of decoding entities. As a result, decoding performance is equivalent, while memory consumption is slightly lower.\n\n</details>\n##### Other changes\n\n-   **minor** add hooks for stack events to tree adapter interface [#&#8203;385](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/385)\n-   **minor** add support for fragments in `parse5-parser-stream` [#&#8203;487](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/487)\n-   **minor** add `serializeOuter` (like `.outerHTML`), `scriptingEnabled` option [#&#8203;383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/383)\n-   **patch** fix parsing of `<<` in comments parsed wrongly as `<!` ([#&#8203;326](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/326))\n-   **patch** fix position of `endTag` for mixed-case foreign elements ([#&#8203;353](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/353))\n-   **patch** fix end position of `html`, `body` ([#&#8203;436](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/436))\n-   docs: parse5 has a new documentation website at [`parse5.js.org`](http://parse5.js.org/) [#&#8203;443](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/443)\n\n##### New Contributors\n\nThanks [@&#8203;anko](https://togithub.com/anko), [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound), [@&#8203;samouri](https://togithub.com/samouri), [@&#8203;alan-agius4](https://togithub.com/alan-agius4), and [@&#8203;pmdartus](https://togithub.com/pmdartus)!\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/compare/v6.0.1...v7.0.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

A common solution is to use a library like momentjs or dayjs or write our own adapter, but if we want to continue using native dates the best way is to just extend the `NativeDateAdapter` and override its `parse` method with a more sophisticated implementation. The problem is that we cannot just extend the `NativeDateAdapter` since the `parse` method signature narrows down the arguments from `value: any, parseFormat: any` to just `value: any` because the current implementation does not honor the `parseFormat`. This is suboptimal since I want to use the `parseFormat` when overriding the implementation and I do not want to extend `DateAdapter` directly.

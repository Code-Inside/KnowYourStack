According to the [docs](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-communications) I've changed my code to:\r\n\r\n    import { Injectable } from \"@angular/core\";\r\n    import { SwUpdate } from \"@angular/service-worker\";\r\n    import { interval } from \"rxjs\";\r\n    @Injectable()\r\n    export class UpdateService {\r\n        constructor(updates: SwUpdate) {\r\n            console.log('UpdateService: Constructor', updates.isEnabled);\r\n\r\n            // This shouldn't be necessary but is a try to get the versionUpdates.

Also I see in the network tab, that new versions of the main.js is being downloaded as I update my app - just my subscription to the versionUpdates observable is never called.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.3\r\nNode: 14.17.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 7.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.4\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... material, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.3\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.3\r\n@angular/fire                   7.3.0\r\n@angular/flex-layout            13.0.0-beta.38\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45707","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SwUpdate: versionUpdates and available not firing\" (#45707)"},{"Id":"1210264631","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T22:06:19","Actor":"atscott","Number":"45705","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): Support lazy loading standalone components with `loadComponent`","State":"open","Body":"Note: this is rebased on top of #45700 which is rebased on the `standalone` branch\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the symmetry being strengthened between children and loadChildren,\r\na new loadComponent property will be introduced as the asynchronous version of component.\r\nThis will allow for direct single-component lazy loading:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{path: 'lazy/a', loadComponent:\r\n  () => import('./lazy/a.component').then(m => m.ACmp)},\r\n{path: 'lazy/b', loadComponent:\r\n  () => import('./lazy/b.component').then(m => m.BCmp)},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis option requires that the component being loaded is standalone and\r\nis implemented as a runtime check.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n* Components are not loaded until all guards and resolvers complete.\r\n* Loading the component is included in the function passed to the router\r\n  preloading strategy\r\n* `RouteConfigLoadStart` and `RouteConfigLoadEnd` events emit at the\r\n  start and end of the component loading\r\n* `CanLoad` guards _do not_ apply to `loadComponent`. `canActivate`\r\n  should be used instead, just like you would do if it were simply\r\n  `component` instead.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45705","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(router): Support lazy loading standalone components with `loadComponent`\" (#45705)"},{"Id":"1210242562","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T21:47:06","Actor":"dylhunn","Number":"45704","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v14.0.0-next.14\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45704","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v14.0.0-next.14\" with changelog.\" (#45704)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1205534412","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-23T00:45:54","Actor":"clydin","Number":"22995","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add initial experimental esbuild-based application browser builder","State":"closed","Body":"An experimental browser application builder (`browser-esbuild`) has been introduced that leverages esbuild as the bundler.\r\nThis new builder is compatible with options of the current browser application builder (`browser`) and can be enabled\r\nfor experimentation purposes by replacing the `builder` field of `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` from an existing\r\nproject to `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild`.

Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.13...14.0.0-next.14)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### http\n\n-   Queries including + will now actually query for + instead of space.\n    Most workarounds involving custom codecs will be unaffected.\n    Possible server-side workarounds will need to be undone.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The type of `component` on `ActivatedRoute` and `ActivatedRouteSnapshot`\n    includes `string`. In reality, this is not the case. The component\n    cannot be anything other than a component class.\n\n-   Lazy loaded configs are now also validated once loaded like the\n    initial set of routes are. Lazy loaded modules which have invalid Route\n    configs will now error. Note that this is only done in dev mode so\n    there is no production impact of this change.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `resolver` argument of the `RouterOutletContract.activateWith` function and the `resolver` field of the `OutletContext` class are deprecated. Passing component factory resolvers are no longer needed. The `ComponentFactoryResolver`-related symbols were deprecated in `@angular/core` package since v13.\n\n##### bazel\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [f8a1ea0c11](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/f8a1ea0c117aa97f45b7696d2b0c9b5679e09b9f) | fix | do not error if files part of `srcs` are outside of package ([#&#8203;45622](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45622)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [046dad1a8d](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/046dad1a8d878ea537a6e2ef5f5ef24a85a2cf02) | fix | fix issue with incremental tracking of APIs for pipes ([#&#8203;45672](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45672)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [174ce7dd13](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/174ce7dd13f6d8f941d3aa0b843559614cb68b0c) | feat | add `ApplicationRef.destroy` method ([#&#8203;45624](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45624)) |\n| [b568a5e708](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/b568a5e708579f5035f40c7218fbba39ad6b3065) | feat | implement `importProvidersFrom` function ([#&#8203;45626](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45626)) |\n| [d5a6cd1111](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/d5a6cd11110c78762a8e6115a718f5851508dbf2) | feat | implement EnvironmentInjector with adapter to NgModuleRef ([#&#8203;45626](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45626)) |\n| [57f8ab2ed8](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/57f8ab2ed81f9fa12ff84fabcd9771ab877809c5) | fix | better error message when directive extends a component ([#&#8203;45658](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45658)) |\n| [c6e0e3f6d3](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c6e0e3f6d31a66dc3034da4dfddbffed4bec37d2) | fix | improve multiple components match error ([#&#8203;45645](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/45645)) |\n\n##### forms\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [e0a2248b32](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/e0a2248b3233b5d384f33859ef6207613cad909d) | feat | Add a FormRecord type.

We come from three projects that rely on parse5 — namely [Cheerio](https://togithub.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), [rehype](https://togithub.com/rehypejs/rehype), and [Lit](https://lit.dev/).\n\n**We need your support to continue the project!** If you care about parse5, please support us financially on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/parse5).\n\nHeadlining features of this release are ES Modules, TypeScript, and performance improvements: 7.0.0 is 45% faster than 6.0.1 with default options, and 167% faster with location information enabled (for the `bench/perf` benchmark, on an M1 Mac). Version 7.0.0 is a revamp of every part of the library. There are too many changes to list them all here, so here is a high-level overview:\n\n##### Breaking: ESM\n\nAll of parse5’s packages are now ECMAScript Modules. We are providing dual packages for `parse5` and `parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter` for now (see [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/418) and [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/496)).\n\nTo migrate, please read [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) on how to update. Note that private internals are no longer available; instead, everything that you need should be imported from the main package.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;43081j](https://togithub.com/43081j) in [#&#8203;351](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/351)*\n\n##### Breaking: TypeScript\n\nThe codebase has been ported to TypeScript. This helped uncover a number of subtle logic bugs, such as [`dc4e269`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/dc4e269022ebbae0767d8f790a29d6be1835fe1e), [`b4b5d4a`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/b4b5d4ad6f90b3c9fd03a90e2ed5267929979a11), or [`a0aff95`](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/commit/a0aff9578bb44511bc169c1d7f9e2f2780f7f8a0). TypeScript also helps us refactor with confidence and a lot of the changes in this release would have been much harder to do without it.\n\nTo migrate, please remove `@types/parse5*` as we now ship our own types.\n\n*Implemented by [@&#8203;fb55](https://togithub.com/fb55) in [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362)*\n\n##### Potentially breaking changes\n\n-   parse5 was caught up with the HTML spec, and parsing results might differ in edge-cases ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/442), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451))\n-   The `parse5-serializer-stream` package was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/481)\n    -   To migrate, use the `serialize` function exported by `parse5`.\n-   The rewriting stream now splits very long text sections ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/434)) and doesn’t escape text in special tags anymore ([#&#8203;434](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/434)). If you worked around these issues before, you might have to update your code.\n-   The htmlparser2 adapter now uses `domhandler`’s node interface ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/327) by [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound))\n    -   The format of the tree nodes has changed slightly; eg. some previous properties are now getters and setters, and vice versa.\n\nIf you are using deep imports for any parts of the codebase, you will likely encounter some breakages:\n\n<details><summary>Show internal changes</summary>\n\n-   The tokenizer now uses the state machine pattern from htmlparser2 [`5d7a780` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/5d7a780b70d3669def4c6bb20cbec816804d44a5)\n-   The token queue was replaced with callbacks ([https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/404), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/405), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/419))\n-   The `OpenElementStack` now uses callbacks [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/429)\n-   Mixins were removed (as part of [#&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/362))\n    -   Location tracking now has a substantially lower overhead [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/402)\n-   `getNextToken` was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/461)\n-   The parser’s `_bootstrap` method was removed [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/384)\n-   We now drop chunks from the tokenizer right after they are emitted [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/432)\n-   The serializer is no longer a class; instead, different serializer functions call on each other [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383)\n-   parse5 now uses the `entities` module for encoding and decoding entities, sharing maintenance & optimisation work with projects such as htmlparser2 ([`2b92054` (#&#8203;362)](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/362/commits/2b9205458b9305de1406966568567ccfc1633fa1), [https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/486))\n    -   `entities` adopted a variant of parse5’s approach of decoding entities. As a result, decoding performance is equivalent, while memory consumption is slightly lower.\n\n</details>\n##### Other changes\n\n-   **minor** add hooks for stack events to tree adapter interface [#&#8203;385](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/385)\n-   **minor** add support for fragments in `parse5-parser-stream` [#&#8203;487](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/487)\n-   **minor** add `serializeOuter` (like `.outerHTML`), `scriptingEnabled` option [#&#8203;383](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/383)\n-   **patch** fix parsing of `<<` in comments parsed wrongly as `<!` ([#&#8203;326](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/326))\n-   **patch** fix position of `endTag` for mixed-case foreign elements ([#&#8203;353](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/353))\n-   **patch** fix end position of `html`, `body` ([#&#8203;436](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/436))\n-   docs: parse5 has a new documentation website at [`parse5.js.org`](http://parse5.js.org/) [#&#8203;443](https://togithub.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/443)\n\n##### New Contributors\n\nThanks [@&#8203;anko](https://togithub.com/anko), [@&#8203;TrySound](https://togithub.com/TrySound), [@&#8203;samouri](https://togithub.com/samouri), [@&#8203;alan-agius4](https://togithub.com/alan-agius4), and [@&#8203;pmdartus](https://togithub.com/pmdartus)!\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/compare/v6.0.1...v7.0.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

TypeScript 4.7 instantiation expression parsing ([#&#8203;2201](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2201))\n\n    This release fixes some additional edge cases with parsing instantiation expressions from the upcoming version 4.7 of TypeScript. Previously it was allowed for an instantiation expression to precede a binary operator but with this release, that's no longer allowed. This was sometimes valid in the TypeScript 4.7 beta but is no longer allowed in the latest version of TypeScript 4.7. Fixing this also fixed a regression that was introduced by the previous release of esbuild:\n\n    | Code           | TS 4.6.3     | TS 4.7.0 beta | TS 4.7.0 nightly | esbuild 0.14.36 | esbuild 0.14.37 | esbuild 0.14.38 |\n    |----------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n    | `a<b> == c<d>` | Invalid      | `a == c`      | Invalid          | `a == c`        | `a == c`        | Invalid         |\n    | `a<b> in c<d>` | Invalid      | Invalid       | Invalid          | Invalid         | `a in c`        | Invalid         |\n    | `a<b>>=c<d>`   | Invalid      | Invalid       | Invalid          | Invalid         | `a >= c`        | Invalid         |\n    | `a<b>=c<d>`    | Invalid      | `a < b >= c`  | `a = c`          | `a < b >= c`    | `a = c`         | `a = c`         |\n    | `a<b>>c<d>`    | `a < b >> c` | `a < b >> c`  | `a < b >> c`     | `a < b >> c`    | `a > c`         | `a < b >> c`    |\n\n    This table illustrates some of the more significant changes between all of these parsers. The most important part is that esbuild 0.14.38 now matches the behavior of the latest TypeScript compiler for all of these cases.\n\n### [`v0.14.37`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01437)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.36...v0.14.37)\n\n-   Add support for TypeScript's `moduleSuffixes` field from TypeScript 4.7\n\n    The upcoming version of TypeScript adds the `moduleSuffixes` field to `tsconfig.json` that introduces more rules to import path resolution. Setting `moduleSuffixes` to `[\".ios\", \".native\", \"\"]` will try to look at the the relative files `./foo.ios.ts`, `./foo.native.ts`, and finally `./foo.ts` for an import path of `./foo`. Note that the empty string `\"\"` in `moduleSuffixes` is necessary for TypeScript to also look-up `./foo.ts`. This was announced in the [TypeScript 4.7 beta blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7-beta/#resolution-customization-with-modulesuffixes).\n\n-   Match the new ASI behavior from TypeScript nightly builds ([#&#8203;2188](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2188))\n\n    This release updates esbuild to match some very recent behavior changes in the TypeScript parser regarding automatic semicolon insertion. For more information, see TypeScript issues [#&#8203;48711](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/48711) and [#&#8203;48654](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/48654) (I'm not linking to them directly to avoid Dependabot linkback spam on these issues due to esbuild's popularity). The result is that the following TypeScript code is now considered valid TypeScript syntax:\n\n    ```ts\n    class A<T> {}\n    new A<number> /* ASI now happens here */\n    if (0) {}\n\n    interface B {\n      (a: number): typeof a /* ASI now happens here */\n      <T>(): void\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;g-plane](https://togithub.com/g-plane).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.14.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/v8.14.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.13.0...v8.14.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`ab6363d`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/ab6363dffb9dfd9c6a9abb5292fc712745fe7a64) feat: Add rule no-constant-binary-expression ([#&#8203;15296](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15296)) (Jordan Eldredge)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`35fa1dd`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/35fa1dd8932ef3e55c37ec0e4b73b5d88f187e69) fix: allow project paths to have URL-encoded characters ([#&#8203;15795](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15795)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`413f1d5`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/413f1d55f0ad05b6fe75bdde6df423253806797d) fix: update `astUtils.isDirectiveComment` with `globals` and `exported` ([#&#8203;15775](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15775)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n\n#### Build Related\n\n-   [`c2407e8`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/c2407e81caf2d50325d9aa09bae70d38615ddf2c) build: add node v18 ([#&#8203;15791](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15791)) (唯然)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`735458c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/735458cc96d4ecdb4ed97448b63ed4a579890b13) chore: add static frontmatter to no-constant-binary-expression docs ([#&#8203;15798](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15798)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`db28f2c`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/db28f2c9ea6b654f615daf2f7e6f1a2034b85062) chore: Add static frontmatter to docs ([#&#8203;15782](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15782)) (Nicholas C.

For example, the two events on `CdkDropList` that tell you the current container to which a dragged item will snap to are `cdkDropListEntered` and `cdkDropListExited`. \r\n\r\nHowever, because of the snapping functionality built into the module from the start, the `cdkDropListExited` event only fires when the item changes its linked container, not when the container HTMLElement is no longer hovered over (what we would expect from `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` from the native browser API).\r\n\r\nWhile this makes the implementation and management of snapping containers much easier, it only complicates the implementation of non-snapping logic. Mostly because there is no *easy* way to know when a `cdkDropList` is no longer hovered.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to either (or both)\r\n\r\n**a)** Introduce two new events in `cdkDropList` that would mirror the native `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` events and would be triggered when a dragged item enter/leave the area occupied by the container's HTML element (the event mimicking `dragEnter` would not constitute a duplicate of the already existing `cdkDropListEntered` one because it is possible to drag the mouse cursor in and out of the container area multiple times while keeping the dragged item bound to it if no other container was hovered over during the operation).\r\n\r\n**b)** Introduce a new type named `cdkHoverTarget` for example, which would act as a non-snapping hover target (and possibly not a container). It would expose the two events reflecting `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` and would be used to know when the user has its mouse cursor over a specific element during a drag operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nOne use of such a feature that I can think of would be in implementing a file manager: when dragging a file over a folder to move it into that folder, one would not expect the file preview to keep saying \"move to <folder>\" when the folder is no longer hovered over. This use case requires the developer to be able to know when a possible drop target is no longer hovered over, which is not trivial to achieve using the currently exposed events of the drag-drop module.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24814","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(drag-drop): Make it easier to know when a CdkDropList is [no longer] hovered\" (#24814)"},{"Id":"1210648738","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-21T07:59:43","Actor":"diprokon","Number":"24813","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input","State":"open","Body":"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input\r\n\r\nShows valid formatted value for 'falsy' values (exp 0)\r\nCustom DateAdapter (exp TimestampDateAdapter) can have valid numeric 0 value (for timestamp it is 1/1/1970), but datepicker input doesn't show formatted value","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24813","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input\" (#24813)"},{"Id":"1209164443","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T23:53:23","Actor":"MikeECunningham","Number":"24803","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix: update table predicate filter","State":"closed","Body":"Change the table's predicate filter to iterate through the map's array of values and check for filter inclusion.

I install types for nfc: [web-nfc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/w3c-web-nfc)\n2. TypeScript is happy, I can create nfc reader instance in my app component: `nfc = new NDEFReader();`\n3. But `ng serve` gives me error: `Cannot find name 'NDEFReader'`\n\nWorkaround:\n\n1. I create file: `src/types/nfc.d.ts`\n2. Put types from package directly to this file (you can comment it in )\n3. Now compiler is happy too\n\nI found question on stackoverflow [cannot-find-name-ndefreader-in-angular-9](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77563841/cannot-find-name-ndefreader-in-angular-9)  But  there is no answer.\n\nBasically it regular package with types, I don't see any troubles with them.

However, if another operation updates the control with { emitEvent: false } while the async validator is still running, the later update overrides the earlier event emission. As a result, when the async validator eventually completes, no status update (VALID/INVALID) is emitted. This behavior seems unintended and could be considered a bug.

This has a couple of drawbacks:\r\n1. We need to store more information that necessary. For example, the only reason we have strings in the arrays is to facilitate host directive aliasing.\r\n2.

Download the project from StackBlitz.\n2. Start it and open in the Edge browser. Open the deprecated \"Detached elements\" tool.\n3. Drag an item from the \"To do\" column to the \"In progress\" column and then to \"Done\".\n4. Collect garbage in the \"Detached elements\" tool and check detached items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere are no detached nodes related to the cdk-drag element.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere are 2 `cdk-drag-dragging` detached nodes. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0fb8a7e-869d-4858-b1f0-b2d79177eb53)\n\nThe same result will be achieved if performed in Chrome, but more details can be seen in the Edge. If the \"Analyze\" button is clicked - you will get an id to the retainer (instead of the initial text \"Object not found in memory anymore\"). Double-clicking on it will show the retainer info. In this case, it's the `CdkDropList._dropListRef._draggables` array.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f25936c-c259-46f6-955a-73de1381b42b)\n\n**Some info after my analysis**: `_draggables` are set in the `DropListRef`'s `withItems` method.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56971d06-deaf-4f0d-86b8-8e73101221ed)\n\nWhile debugging I should have entered it via `_syncItemsWithRef`, but there's a `this._dropListRef.isDragging()` condition in the `removeItem` method. In my case, I've already dropped an item and it's no longer dragging. Therefore `_draggables` are not updated and there's a `cdk-drag` detached node because of that.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65010937-ced3-4911-bd12-4ef965ab2085)\n\nI'm not sure if that condition should be there at all, cause surely we need to sync items with ref **not only when dragging is in progress**. Here's a [link to the commit](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/d1a6ea74db0881001bf02ff113f269552effc4f6) where those changes were added.\n\nFor my project, I monkey-patched `removeItem` method and removed `isDragging()` condition. For us, the case when an item should be removed while dragging is not relevant.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.0.6\n- CDK/Material: 19.0.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome/Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11 Pro\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30506","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[drag-drop] cdk-drag node is detached after element is dropped from one container to another\" (#30506)"},{"Id":"2862668651","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-19T16:49:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30514","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/drag-drop): avoid retaining destroyed items until next drag","State":"closed","Body":"We have some logic that registers and de-registers the items on create/destroy.

This limitation forces me to rely on the `!important` keyword to override these styles, which isn’t ideal.\n\nIs there a recommended approach or a potential enhancement to allow these inline styles to be assigned to a specific CSS layer by default?\n\nHere’s an example for reference:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/717631b1-a250-4182-bd59-19ed22fb5be2)\n\nThank you for the help!\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a configuration option that allows developers to specify a CSS layer for the injected Material components' styles. Instead of inserting these styles without layer information, the library would wrap them in a `<style>` tag with the appropriate CSS layer attribute (e.g., `layer=\"material\"`). This change would enable more predictable cascading behavior and simplify style overrides by eliminating the need for `!important`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- **Overriding with `!important`**: Currently, developers rely on using `!important` to override the default styles. However, this approach can lead to maintenance issues and unintended side effects.\n- **Manual style injection**: Developers could manually override or inject additional CSS rules after the default styles load, but this solution is error-prone and lacks scalability.\n- **Custom style injection**: Overriding the internal style injection mechanism might be possible, but this would be a hacky workaround that could break with future updates.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30512","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Possibility to set all Material's CSS in a specific CSS

\"1.0.0-beta.10\", which were working fine in Angular 14 and 15 but I am facing run-time error since I have updated to Angular 16, I do not wish to update \"@angular/cdk\", \"@angular/http\", \"@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap\" etc because I have written code according to that version and want to use the same version in Angular 16, How I can do that?\n\npackage.json\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\":

stays opened.  \n\nI expected the same behavior like with the MatDatePicker, if the picker panel is opened, when using Escape the picker is closed first, and then using Escape again closes the sideNav.\n\nI also provide the same sample inside a Dialog using the MatSelect and MatDatePicker and in this case, both works the same way and correctly.\n\nThe issue seems related to this

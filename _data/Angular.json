It is also a big hacky to call\r\ncompile directly and expect an exception to be thrown for diagnostics.\r\n\r\nAlso, this can easily be unit tested and an end-to-end test is not\r\nnecessary since we are not making use of the goldfiles for these tests.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to maintain and less hacky to validate that we get helpful\r\nerror messages when nesting i18n sections by calling getDiagnostics\r\ndirectly.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40072","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(compiler-cli): fix i18n error tests\" (#40072)"},{"Id":"761550283","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-10T19:36:07","Actor":"atscott","Number":"40071","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): only ignore TCB nodes with the ignore diagnostics marker when requesting diagnostics","State":"open","Body":"refactor(compiler-cli): Add flag to TCB for non-diagnostic requests \r\n\r\nThe TCB utility functions used to find nodes in the TCB are currently\r\nconfigured to ignore results when an ignore marker is found.

I ran into some issues, which were resolved using the solution provided by a member of the Angular CLI team here: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39953. However, even though I can now build my app and its projects, when I try to run the tests, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n_ERROR [karma-server]: Server start failed on port 9876: TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'reporter:coverage' in karma-spec-reporter_\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why this is occurring, as it does not appear any of the Karma packages were changed, and my Karma configuration files have not changed either. The tests _will_ run if I disable code coverage reports, but I need those. I've also tried removing my codeCoverageExclusions, to no effect.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\nI apologize that I'm unable to share the code behind this, but the scenario is:\r\n\r\n- Workspace containing 2 library projects and a main app\r\n- Problematic upgrade as described in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39953\r\n- Running _ng test_ or _ng test --project=(project)_ fails with the error mentioned above\r\n- Running _ng test_ with _--code-coverage=false_, or _codeCoverage=false_ in _angular.json_ works as expected, no error\r\n- I do not have this problem on a smaller, simpler app which just contains the main app in the workspace\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR [karma-server]: Server start failed on port 9876: TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'reporter:coverage' in karma-spec-reporter\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.3\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    8.2.3\r\n@angular/http                   7.2.16\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.3\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.3\r\nng-packagr                      11.0.3\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nA zip file containing my angular.json, and the karma.conf.js for my main app (but this has not changed), is attached.\r\n[KarmaNoLikey.zip](https://github.com/angular/angular/files/5661311/KarmaNoLikey.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19571","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"After Upgrading a Workspace Containing Multiple Projects to Angular 11, Karma Refuses to Run\" (#19571)"},{"Id":"759880744","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-09T13:05:58","Actor":"Nagendracv","Number":"19575","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot install angular cli","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n- [x ] new\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nNot sure.

It is not present in the fresh project generated with Angular CLI 10.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhile debugging a size regression in ng-bootstrap (https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/issues/3904#issuecomment-740845567) when used in Angular 11 application I've spotted that a lot of dead code is retained because `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` is declared as a separate variable. Such pattern retains a linked component and consequently a lot of extra code used by this component. E.g. below code in the library will retain `MylibComponent` using Angular CLI 11, but will be removed as dead code using Angular CLI 10:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst TEST_VALUE_ACCESSOR = {\r\n  provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\r\n  useExisting: forwardRef(() => MylibComponent),\r\n  multi: true,\r\n};\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'lib-mylib',\r\n  template: ` <p>mylib works!</p> `,\r\n  styles: [],\r\n  providers: [TEST_VALUE_ACCESSOR],\r\n})\r\nexport class MylibComponent implements OnInit, ControlValueAccessor { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n- This only happens when code is present in the library. Component is eliminated as dead code if it is part of the application.\r\n- Inlining the variable will result in component being eliminated as dead code.\r\n- Library code processed by `ngcc` is identical, so I guess something in the application bundling has changed.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Clone the reproductions for Angular 10 and 11 (fresh project + fresh lib + minimal code reproducing the problem, each in a separate commit):\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   git clone -b va10 git@github.com:devoto13/va-regression-repro.git va10\r\n   git clone -b va11 git@github.com:devoto13/va-regression-repro.git va11\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2.

Execute `ng build --prod`\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`@angular/forms` should be imported in the chunk lazy loaded.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`@angular/forms` is being imported in the main chunk.\r\n\r\nNote that if we remove the lazy route from `app.routing.module.ts`, then `@angular/forms` goes away from the main chunk, even using `mat-nav-list` in `app.component.html`. Also, if we keep the lazy route and remove the `MatListModule` dependency from the `AppModule`, then the `@angular/forms` goes to the lazy chunk, as it should be.\r\n\r\nA possible solution would be spliting `list.ts` and `selection-list.ts` into two different `NgModule`, so, if we are not using the `selection-list.ts` part, we just import the `NgModule` that contains `list.ts`, which does not depend on `@angular/forms`. \r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.7\r\nNode: 14.8.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.7\r\n@angular/cdk                    10.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.7\r\n@angular/material               10.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.7\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.7\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19562","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatListModule): Should not import @angular/forms in main chunk if it's just using mat-nav-list\" (#19562)"},{"Id":"758769010","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-07T19:24:52","Actor":"koenig-dominik","Number":"19563","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng lint with eslint Unknown option: '--files'","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

I want to be able to sort the rows using the Mat Sort directive. However, after the datasource has changed, if I set the sort property with the existing @ViewChild(MatSort), the subsequent calls to sortData increases. It can harm performances if we go back and forth between data sources. \r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nI tried to look in several attributes in MatSort and MatTable and see if I can either destroy the directive or unsubscribe from any Subject.

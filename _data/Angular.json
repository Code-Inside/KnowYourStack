This is correct if the bigint doesn't have a radix because bigint literals without a radix are always in canonical form (since leading zeros are not allowed). However, this is incorrect if the bigint has a radix (e.g. `0x123n`) because the canonical form is not enforced when a radix is present.\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(!!0n, !!1n, 123n === 123n)\n    console.log(!!0x0n, !!0x1n, 123n === 0x7Bn)\n\n    // Old output\n    console.log(false, true, true);\n    console.log(true, true, false);\n\n    // New output\n    console.log(false, true, true);\n    console.log(!!0x0n, !!0x1n, 123n === 0x7Bn);\n    ```\n\n-   Add some improvements to the JavaScript minifier\n\n    This release adds more cases to the JavaScript minifier, including support for inlining `String.fromCharCode` and `String.prototype.charCodeAt` when possible:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    document.onkeydown = e => e.keyCode === 'A'.charCodeAt(0) && console.log(String.fromCharCode(55358, 56768))\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    document.onkeydown=o=>o.keyCode===\"A\".charCodeAt(0)&&console.log(String.fromCharCode(55358,56768));\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    document.onkeydown=o=>o.keyCode===65&&console.log(\"🧀\");\n    ```\n\n    In addition, immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFEs) that return a single expression are now inlined when minifying. This makes it possible to use IIFEs in combination with `@__PURE__` annotations to annotate arbitrary expressions as side-effect free without the IIFE wrapper impacting code size. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    const sideEffectFreeOffset = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ (() => computeSomething())()\n    use(sideEffectFreeOffset)\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    const e=(()=>computeSomething())();use(e);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    const e=computeSomething();use(e);\n    ```\n\n-   Automatically prefix the `mask-composite` CSS property for WebKit ([#&#8203;3493](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3493))\n\n    The `mask-composite` property will now be prefixed as `-webkit-mask-composite` for older WebKit-based browsers. In addition to prefixing the property name, handling older browsers also requires rewriting the values since WebKit uses non-standard names for the mask composite modes:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    div {\n      mask-composite: add, subtract, intersect, exclude;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome100) */\n    div {\n      -webkit-mask-composite:\n        source-over,\n        source-out,\n        source-in,\n        xor;\n      mask-composite:\n        add,\n        subtract,\n        intersect,\n        exclude;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Avoid referencing `this` from JSX elements in derived class constructors ([#&#8203;3454](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3454))\n\n    When you enable `--jsx=automatic` and `--jsx-dev`, the JSX transform is supposed to insert `this` as the last argument to the `jsxDEV` function. I'm not sure exactly why this is and I can't find any specification for it, but in any case this causes the generated code to crash when you use a JSX element in a derived class constructor before the call to `super()` as `this` is not allowed to be accessed at that point. For example\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class ChildComponent extends ParentComponent {\n      constructor() {\n        super(<div />)\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Problematic output (with --loader=jsx --jsx=automatic --jsx-dev)\n    import { jsxDEV } from \"react/jsx-dev-runtime\";\n    class ChildComponent extends ParentComponent {\n      constructor() {\n        super(/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ jsxDEV(\"div\", {}, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: \"<stdin>\",\n          lineNumber: 3,\n          columnNumber: 15\n        }, this)); // The reference to \"this\" crashes here\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The TypeScript compiler doesn't handle this at all while the Babel compiler just omits `this` for the entire constructor (even after the call to `super()`). There seems to be no specification so I can't be sure that this change doesn't break anything important. But given that Babel is pretty loose with this and TypeScript doesn't handle this at all, I'm guessing this value isn't too important. React's blog post seems to indicate that this value was intended to be used for a React-specific migration warning at some point, so it could even be that this value is irrelevant now. Anyway the crash in this case should now be fixed.\n\n-   Allow package subpath imports to map to node built-ins ([#&#8203;3485](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3485))\n\n    You are now able to use a [subpath import](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) in your package to resolve to a node built-in module. For example, with a `package.json` file like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"type\": \"module\",\n      \"imports\": {\n        \"#stream\": {\n          \"node\": \"stream\",\n          \"default\": \"./stub.js\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can now import from node's `stream` module like this:\n\n    ```js\n    import * as stream from '#stream';\n    console.log(Object.keys(stream));\n    ```\n\n    This will import from node's `stream` module when the platform is `node` and from `./stub.js` otherwise.\n\n-   No longer throw an error when a `Symbol` is missing ([#&#8203;3453](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3453))\n\n    Certain JavaScript syntax features use special properties on the global `Symbol` object. For example, the asynchronous iteration syntax uses `Symbol.asyncIterator`. Previously esbuild's generated code for older browsers required this symbol to be polyfilled. However, starting with this release esbuild will use [`Symbol.for()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/for) to construct these symbols if they are missing instead of throwing an error about a missing polyfill. This means your code no longer needs to include a polyfill for missing symbols as long as your code also uses `Symbol.for()` for missing symbols.\n\n-   Parse upcoming changes to TypeScript syntax ([#&#8203;3490](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3490), [#&#8203;3491](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3491))\n\n    With this release, you can now use `from` as the name of a default type-only import in TypeScript code, as well as `of` as the name of an `await using` loop iteration variable:\n\n    ```ts\n    import type from from 'from'\n    for (await using of of of) ;\n    ```\n\n    This matches similar changes in the TypeScript compiler ([#&#8203;56376](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/56376) and [#&#8203;55555](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/55555)) which will start allowing this syntax in an upcoming version of TypeScript. Please never actually write code like this.\n\n    The type-only import syntax change was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.54.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.54.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.53.0...v8.54.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`a7a883b`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a7a883bd6ba4f140b60cbbb2be5b53d750f6c8db) feat: for-direction rule add check for condition in reverse order ([#&#8203;17755](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17755)) (Angelo Annunziata)\n-   [`1452dc9`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/1452dc9f12c45c05d7c569f737221f0d988ecef1) feat: Add suggestions to no-console ([#&#8203;17680](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17680)) (Joel Mathew Koshy)\n-   [`21ebf8a`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/21ebf8a811be9f4b009cf70a10be5062d4fdc736) feat: update `no-array-constructor` rule ([#&#8203;17711](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17711)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`98926e6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/98926e6e7323e5dd12a9f016cb558144296665af) fix: Ensure that extra data is not accidentally stored in the cache file ([#&#8203;17760](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17760)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`e8cf9f6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/e8cf9f6a524332293f8b2c90a2db4a532e47d919) fix: Make dark scroll bar in dark theme ([#&#8203;17753](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17753)) (Pavel)\n-   [`3cbeaad`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/3cbeaad7b943c153937ce34365cec2c406f2b98b) fix: Use `cwd` constructor option as config `basePath` in Linter ([#&#8203;17705](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17705)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`becfdd3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/becfdd39b25d795e56c9a13eb3e77af6b9c86e8a) docs: Make clear when rules are removed ([#&#8203;17728](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17728)) (Nicholas C.

From v17 there is no possibility to reference static assets with absolute url. Using base hrefs is not proper replacement because relative links must stay relative to root when users wants to open links in new tab (ctrl + click) and also for non javascript consumers of server side rendered pages. Combinations with APP_BASE_HREF are not applicable for this use case. Due to this we believe this is regression for no good reason.\r\n\r\n              We are still planning to remove `deployUrl` eventually largely because of all the confusion it causes. The exact version it gets dropped is still TBH, but I can confidently say it will *not* be removed in v14, so this shouldn't be an immediate problem for anyone. The blog post in particular should hopefully help address common use cases which have used `deployUrl` in the past and how we recommend moving forward for each of them.

The application neither updates the UI nor throws any errors, and it requires a restart to reflect the changes. This issue is intermittent but significantly hampers the development process.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n1. Run the application using `ng serve`.\r\n2. Make changes to a component or service.\r\n3. Save the file.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nThe application should automatically reflect the changes in the browser without needing to manually restart the server.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nSometimes, the application does not update the UI or show any error messages after saving changes. The only workaround is to stop and restart `ng serve`.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Angular version: 17.x.x\r\n- Browser: [e.g., Chrome, Firefox]\r\n- Operating System: [e.g., Windows, macOS]\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**:\r\nThis issue does not occur every time but is frequent enough to disrupt the normal workflow. I have not experienced this in previous versions of Angular. Any insights or solutions to this problem would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTaner Saydam\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal

present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi! \r\nI found an issue while using the cdk Overlay and the [dialog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) HTML element. \r\nI'm working on a modal component using the dialog element and its \"showModal()\" API to display it as a modal dialog.\r\nThe problem is that the Overlay is not \"promoted\" to the top layer and it remains hidden behind the dialog.\r\nI'm attaching a [Stackblitz reproduction](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-kbnyrg?file=src%2Fdialog%2Fdialog.component.html) of the issue.\r\n\r\nIn addiction, I tried also to implement a custom overlay to place the `cdk-overlay-container` close to the input instead of the default behaviour at the bottom of the body, but then the `cdk-overlay-panel` _left_ position seems to be computed in a wrong way, in the sense that the content box seems to be the dialog but the left position is computed considering the viewport as content box. I guess (just guessing) the second issue is something related to [this discussion](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8040) about the w3c dialog specification.\r\n\r\nI found the issues using both @angular/cdk versions 16 and 17. The Stackblitz uses the latest one for convenience.\r\n\r\nThank you, looking forward for some feedback on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-kbnyrg?file=src%2Fdialog%2Fdialog.component.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.  Click the button \"Open dialog\"\r\n2.  Click on the input \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe overlay should appear below the input.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe overlay is hidden behind the dialog.

There is a `:before` pseudo element which has an empty string as content, and I believe the purpose of this element is to set the height of the title element with the `mat-dialog-title` directive.  Is this correct?  This implementation seems very hacky to me and flexbox `justify-content` does not work property because this pseudo element is considered an element within a flex container, and therefore the developer either needs to create a new flex container within the `mat-dialog-title` or remove the content from the `:before` psuedo element.  Am I not not thinking of this correctly and is there another way to use `justify-content` which works with this psuedo element?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf the `mat-dialog-title` container is a flex container, `justify-content: space-between` works correctly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n`justify-content: space-between` adds space between the psuedo element which has an empty string as content and the next element within the `mat-dialog-title`\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16.2.10\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.2.9\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28129","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"hacky(COMPONENT): Dialog title :before psuedo element\" (#28129)"},{"Id":"1994762207","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-15T13:17:04","Actor":"rpanadero","Number":"28128","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(theming): view encapsulation and theming own Angular components?","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nI don't find clear information about how to theme my own Angular components. I have just found this documentation: \r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components\r\n\r\nIn the next example, image I'm creating a custom carousel Angular component which has a theming scss file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// _carousel-theme.scss\r\n\r\n@use 'sass:map';\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n\r\n@mixin color($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel-button {\r\n    // Read the 500 hue from the primary color palette.\r\n    color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary, 500);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin typography($theme) {\r\n  .my-carousel {\r\n    // Get the headline font from the theme.\r\n    font: mat.get-theme-typography($theme, headline-1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@mixin theme($theme) {\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, color) {\r\n    @include color($theme);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @if mat.theme-has($theme, typography) {\r\n    @include typography($theme);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\r\n@use './path/to/carousel-theme' as carousel;\r\n\r\n@include mat.core();\r\n\r\n$my-primary: mat.define-palette(mat.$indigo-palette, 500);\r\n$my-accent: mat.define-palette(mat.$pink-palette, A200, A100, A400);\r\n\r\n$my-theme: mat.define-light-theme((\r\n color: (\r\n   primary: $my-primary,\r\n   accent: $my-accent,\r\n ),\r\n typography: mat.define-typography-config(\r\n    $font-family: serif,\r\n  );\r\n));\r\n\r\n@include mat.all-component-themes($my-theme);\r\n@include carousel.theme($my-theme);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach doesn't take into account Angular view encapsulation at component level since 'my-carousel' class styles are global after '@include' them in 'styles.scss' file. Therefore, if I use 'my-carousel' CSS class in some HTML element of my application, apart from 'carousel' Angular component, the theming is applied.\r\n\r\nCould you provide me with best practices to deal with this scenario?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, is it a good practice to use `mat-*` classes in component html? I don't find docs on this, so I guess not.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to everyone!\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28128","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(theming): view encapsulation and theming own Angular components?\" (#28128)"},{"Id":"1994424572","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-15T09:51:07","Actor":"Burgov","Number":"28127","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Dialog): cannot use material components within dialogs","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nOur application used to be an AppModule, I'm now rebuilding it to a standalone AppComponent and using the modern way of bootstrapping applications.\r\n\r\nI'm running into a weird issue though.

Ever since v18.1.0 was released, the ng update command started to fail. 2 of my projects migrated just fine to version 18.0.6. \r\n\r\nThe reason for the failure is because of the temporary cli version 18.1.0 that is installed. The error messages is - \"No matching version found for @angular-devkit/architect@0.1801.0.\"\r\n\r\nSeems like this package is missing. Can this be addressed as I can no longer migrate any project to version 18 ? Is there a way to specify which temporary cli version to use? If yes, then I can use this as a workaround for now.

As a developer, I've often struggled to maintain deprecated or experimental features that still work but might be removed in future versions. It's like navigating a catwalk without a clear exit route, leaving me uncertain about the best path forward. If you start with new skinny clothing all plays nice, but older larger clothing is a problem.\r\n\r\nA flag system would empower me to explicitly opt out of these features and ensure my code remains maintainable and future-proof, allowing me to continue using established syntaxes while still having the option to adopt newer ones as I see fit.\r\n\r\nThis flexibility would greatly improve my development experience, enabling me to balance innovation with stability and reduce the risk of breaking changes.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, Angular team? Could a flag system be added to give developers more control over their project's evolution?\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAll current deprications will be removed \r\nthough in cases this gives problems, have environment.ts settings that can keep allowing certain things like old style routeguards for example.\r\n\r\nOne might also then be able to opt in for a set of specific new language features\r\nAs this lives at the project level special attention should be put to imports, as external imports may involve different flag setups.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nFreeze the language, no more deprecations, but add extension modules to enrich the language.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deprication flag system\" (#56941)"},{"Id":"2401816726","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-10T22:04:52","Actor":"rbalet","Number":"56939","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(localize): avoid redirection loop in the apache2.conf example","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

According to the Angular documentation, interceptors are run in the injection context of the injector which registered them and can use Angular's inject API to retrieve dependencies. However, when I attempt to use the inject function, it throws the following error:\r\n`Error: NG0203: inject() must be called from an injection context such as a constructor, a factory function, a field initializer, or a function used with `runInInjectionContext`.`\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:** \r\n\r\n1. Create an HttpInterceptorFn as shown below:\r\n```typescript \r\nexport const authInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (\r\n  req,\r\n  next,\r\n): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> =>\r\n  next(req).pipe(\r\n    tap({\r\n      error: (err: any) => {\r\n        if (err instanceof HttpErrorResponse) {\r\n          if (err.status === 401) {\r\n            navigateOut();\r\n          }\r\n          inject(ErrorHandler).handleError(err);\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n    }),\r\n  );\r\n ```\r\n2. Add this to appconfig`provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authInterceptor]))`\r\n3. Run the application and trigger an HTTP request that results in an error.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:** The inject function should be able to retrieve the ErrorHandler dependency without throwing an error.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:** The inject function throws an error indicating it must be called from an injection context.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:** \r\nAngular version: 18.0.5\r\nnx version: 19.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nError: NG0203: inject() must be called from an injection context such as a constructor, a factory function, a field initializer, or a function used with `runInInjectionContext`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular version: 18.0.5\r\nNx version: 19.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56916","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`inject` function throws error when used in `HttpInterceptorFn`\" (#56916)"},{"Id":"2398711176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-09T16:51:50","Actor":"homerlsy","Number":"56914","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update structural-directives.md","State":"open","Body":"docs: this custom directive's selector should be [select]\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Specifically, our builder adds plugins to webpack for handling fonts and SVGs from assets, which are subsequently included in indexHtml, along with additional scripts.\r\n\r\nI attempted to use a `buildApplicationInternal` equivalent for esbuild, but I encountered difficulties retrieving fonts and SVG information in the `onEnd` callbacks to use later in `indexHtmlTransformer` - not all information about media files is returned in metafile.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for guidance on the best approach to take when working with esbuild, considering the need to maintain our existing logic.\r\nIs it save to use `buildApplicationInternal` in the future?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I tried to run the project with ng serve. However, instead of launching Vite, webpack is initiated.\r\n\r\nThis might be because `ng serve `uses the `isEsbuildBased` function for verification, which only checks:\r\n```\r\nfunction isEsbuildBased(builderName) {\r\n    if (builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:application' ||\r\n        builderName === '@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild') {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni have my custom builder name there.\r\n\r\nI might be missing something here, but there is no documentation for these cases.

This could be a documentation bug or a regression from the legacy controls, but the prefix is a different bug that this one I am reporting.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/qbaesq\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

After the switch an error is shown below each field, the error is a check that the field contains the correct CSS class for the control implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNo error should be shown because each field switch dynamically the control generated CSS class.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nFields don't change to the control CSS class dynamically, it always stays on the same initial class.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 18.0.6\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.6\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chromium\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Linux (Fedora)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29402","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-form-field): CSS class generated by controlType of  MatFormFieldControl is static, never changes if the control changes\" (#29402)"},{"Id":"2398091207","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-09T12:34:50","Actor":"GeorgianStan","Number":"29401","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material/form-field): hiding a label after it has been shown leaves a blank space","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<img width=\"174\" alt=\"input-label-bug\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/components/assets/25796932/f36c3892-addf-4c8c-b557-7c9f37052e81\">\r\n\r\nWhen the `mat-label` tag is removed from a `mat-form-field` a white gap remains visible.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field appearance=\"outline\">\r\n  @if (hasLabel$ | async){\r\n    <mat-label>My input</mat-label>\r\n  }\r\n  <input matInput type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"name\" />\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class App {\r\n  hasLabel$ = new BehaviorSubject(true);\r\n  name = '';\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      this.hasLabel$.next(false);\r\n    }, 3000);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-cxncvy?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIf `hasLabel$` has a default value of `false` `hasLabel$ = new BehaviorSubject(false);` and `mat-label` is hidden from the start, it works as it should, but I would expect it to work as well if the label is removed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe blank space remains visible.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 18\r\n- CDK/Material: 18\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29401","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/form-field): hiding a label after it has been shown leaves a blank space\" (#29401)"},{"Id":"2396835560","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-09T00:31:26","Actor":"jullierme","Number":"29399","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/table): add optional footer to cdk-text-column","State":"open","Body":"Added two new inputs to `CdkTextColumn`:\r\n`footerText` (string) and `footerTextTransform` (function), automatically inherited by MatTextColumn.\r\n\r\nIf the table does not define a footer, the column footer will be ignored.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `TextColumnOptions` includes a new default function called `defaultFooterTextTransform`, used when neither `footerTextTransform` nor `footerText` are provided.\r\n\r\nFixes #24532","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29399","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(cdk/table): add optional footer to cdk-text-column\" (#29399)"},{"Id":"2396589337","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-08T21:16:47","Actor":"DBowen33","Number":"29398","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/chips): chip focus trap fix","State":"open","Body":"Fixed an issue to where users can get stuck in a focus trap in mat-grid.

Despite the signal being set to an empty string, the input is still displaying 'a'\r\n\r\n_Note: the signal state is correctly used to filter, which means that clicking on the input will display all values (despite the displayed 'a', which should supposedly be used to filter). For example, if you change the code to do `this.currentFruit.set('apple')` and reproduce this bug again, only the Apple element will be displayed when clicking a second time on the autocomplete (despite having only 'a' displayed)_ \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input should reflect the signal state correctly.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter clicking on an option in a chips-autocomplete, the input is not updated according to the signal state.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: 18.0.6\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu, probably? (this comes from the Stackblitz)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29388","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(chips-autocomplete): Signal with two-way binding on an autocomplete with chips is not updating input\" (#29388)"},{"Id":"2392523696","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-05T12:58:12","Actor":"hhaasbroek","Number":"29387","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(date-picker): Added context to docs for date picker null value #29385","State":"closed","Body":"Updated the  docs to add context as to why the null value is included as an argument in the filter\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29385","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29387","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(date-picker): Added context to docs for date picker null value #29385\" (#29387)"},{"Id":"2392484300","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-05T12:15:45","Actor":"hhaasbroek","Number":"29386","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(formfield):Formfield password suffix icon docs example show/hide not working #29356","State":"closed","Body":"Updated the show hide functionality of the button suffix when clicking the password show/hide icon\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29356","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29386","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(formfield):Formfield password suffix icon docs example show/hide not working #29356\" (#29386)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-07-11T03:30:02.2565509Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1394}

This markdown file can serve as documentation, guidelines, code snippets, or even prompts to help Copilot generate better suggestions.\n\nFor example, we can have a **GUIDE.md** or **PROMPT_GUIDE.md** with structured information, such as:\n\n1. Project Overview: A short introduction about the purpose and architecture of the project.\n\n2. Code Style & Guidelines: Define best practices that Copilot should follow when suggesting code.\n\n3. Common Patterns & Examples: Include sample code snippets that Copilot can use as reference.\n\n4.

Is there a particular reason for this default?\n\nAdditionally, this behavior feels inconsistent with Angular CLI's typical approach of generating neutral templates. For instance, the CLI doesn't set a default `lang` attribute in HTML and expect developers to modify it; instead, it leaves this tag unset by default.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI’d suggest one of the following:\n\n* Remove the default `<meta name=\"theme-color\">` from the schematic.\n* Replace the color with a neutral default.\n* Make the additional option via a prompt when running `ng add @angular/pwa`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nDevelopers can manually change or remove the tag when reviewing changes or after noticing unexpected UI coloring.\nHowever, since `theme-color` affects the browser UI rather than visible page elements, it can be difficult for less experienced developers to pick the color and trace its source.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular/pwa: Consider necessity of defaulting to the specific theme-color #1976d2\" (#30336)"},{"Id":"3070796624","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-17T13:57:48","Actor":"jnizet","Number":"30335","RawContent":null,"Title":"Generated app component does not respect style guide","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen generating a new project with version 20 of the CLI, the following component class is generated:\n\n```ts\nexport class App {\n  title = 'foov20';\n}\n```\n\nThis violates the [new style guide](https://next.angular.dev/style-guide#use-protected-on-class-members-that-are-only-used-by-a-components-template), which says:\n\n> [Use protected on class members that are only used by a component's template](https://next.angular.dev/style-guide#use-protected-on-class-members-that-are-only-used-by-a-components-template)\n\nIf we add the `protected` modifier though, the generated spec doesn't compile anymore. Indeed, the spec file contains these three tests:\n\n```ts\n  it('should create the app', () => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n    const app = fixture.componentInstance;\n    expect(app).toBeTruthy();\n  });\n\n  it(`should have the 'foov20' title`, () => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n    const app = fixture.componentInstance;\n    expect(app.title).toEqual('foov20');\n  });\n\n  it('should render title', () => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);\n    fixture.detectChanges();\n    const compiled = fixture.nativeElement as HTMLElement;\n    expect(compiled.querySelector('h1')?.textContent).toContain('Hello, foov20');\n  });\n```\n\nbut I would argue that \n\n - the first one isn't really useful (if it fails, the other two tests also fail)\n - the second one (which is the one that does not compile anymore) isn't really useful either: it tests the internal implementation of the component rather than testing its behavior, and the third one is sufficient.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n`npx @angular/cli@next new foov20`\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0-rc.2\nNode: 20.12.2\nPackage Manager: npm 10.5.0\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0-rc.1\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.0-rc.2\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.0-rc.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.0-rc.2\n@angular/build               20.0.0-rc.2\n@angular/cli                 20.0.0-rc.2\n@schematics/angular          20.0.0-rc.2\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generated app component does not respect style guide\" (#30335)"},{"Id":"3070352016","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-17T05:01:55","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30334","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.28.18","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.28.17` -> `v3.28.18` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.28.18`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v3.28.18)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.28.17...v3.28.18)\n\n### CodeQL Action Changelog\n\nSee the [releases page](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases) for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.\n\n#### 3.28.18 - 16 May 2025\n\n-   Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.21.3.

Each time I need the cache disabled, I have to manually edit angular.json and later revert the change. It'd be great if I could avoid these steps.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nHaving a `--no-cache` option for `ng serve` would make this workflow much smoother. It would disable caching only for that specific run, leaving the global configuration untouched.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI can automate this process using the trap command in a shell script, but since trap doesn’t work on Windows, I’d need to maintain a custom script, which complicates things unnecessarily for this simple problem.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30308","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow disabling CLI cache in `ng serve` via command-line flag\" (#30308)"},{"Id":"3067944765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-16T16:56:38","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30325","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency aspect_rules_ts to v3.6.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [aspect_rules_ts](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts) | http_archive | minor | `v3.5.3` -> `v3.6.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>aspect-build/rules_ts (aspect_rules_ts)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.6.0`](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/releases/tag/v3.6.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/compare/v3.5.3...v3.6.0)\n\n#### Using [Bzlmod]:\n\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\n\n```starlark\nbazel_dep(name = \"aspect_rules_ts\", version = \"3.6.0\")\n\nrules_ts_ext = use_extension(\"@&#8203;aspect_rules_ts//ts:extensions.bzl\", \"ext\", dev_dependency = True)\n\nrules_ts_ext.deps(\n    ts_version_from = \"//:package.json\",\n)\n\nuse_repo(rules_ts_ext, \"npm_typescript\")\n```\n\n[Bzlmod]: https://bazel.build/build/bzlmod\n\n#### Using legacy WORKSPACE\n\nPaste this snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file:\n\n```starlark\nload(\"@&#8203;bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"aspect_rules_ts\",\n    sha256 = \"6b15ac1c69f2c0f1282e41ab469fd63cd40eb2e2d83075e19b68a6a76669773f\",\n    strip_prefix = \"rules_ts-3.6.0\",\n    url = \"https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/releases/download/v3.6.0/rules_ts-v3.6.0.tar.gz\",\n)\n\n##################\n\n### rules_ts setup #\n##################\n\n### Fetches the rules_ts dependencies.\n### If you want to have a different version of some dependency,\n\n### you should fetch it *before* calling this.\n### Alternatively, you can skip calling this function, so long as you've\n\n### already fetched all the dependencies.\nload(\"@&#8203;aspect_rules_ts//ts:repositories.bzl\", \"rules_ts_dependencies\")\n\nrules_ts_dependencies(\n\n### This keeps the TypeScript version in-sync with the editor, which is typically best.\n    ts_version_from = \"//:package.json\",\n\n### Alternatively, you could pick a specific version, or use\n### load(\"@&#8203;aspect_rules_ts//ts:repositories.bzl\", \"LATEST_TYPESCRIPT_VERSION\")\n\n### ts_version = LATEST_TYPESCRIPT_VERSION\n)\n\nload(\"@&#8203;aspect_rules_js//js:repositories.bzl\", \"rules_js_dependencies\")\n\nrules_js_dependencies()\n\nload(\"@&#8203;aspect_rules_js//js:toolchains.bzl\", \"DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION\", \"rules_js_register_toolchains\")\n\nrules_js_register_toolchains(node_version = DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION)\n\n### Register aspect_bazel_lib toolchains;\n### If you use npm_translate_lock or npm_import from aspect_rules_js you can omit this block.\nload(\"@&#8203;aspect_bazel_lib//lib:repositories.bzl\", \"register_copy_directory_toolchains\", \"register_copy_to_directory_toolchains\")\n\nregister_copy_directory_toolchains()\n\nregister_copy_to_directory_toolchains()\n```\n\nTo use rules_ts with bazel-lib 2.x, you must additionally register the coreutils toolchain.\n\n```starlark\nload(\"@&#8203;aspect_bazel_lib//lib:repositories.bzl\", \"register_coreutils_toolchains\")\n\nregister_coreutils_toolchains()\n```\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   fix(publish): pick up secret when passed from caller workflow by [@&#8203;alexeagle](https://redirect.github.com/alexeagle) in [https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/pull/802](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/pull/802)\n-   refactor: do not re-copy_to_bin ts_project(srcs) by [@&#8203;jbedard](https://redirect.github.com/jbedard) in [https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/pull/803](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/pull/803)\n-   feat: support custom progress messages by [@&#8203;devversion](https://redirect.github.com/devversion) in [https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/pull/807](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/pull/807)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;devversion](https://redirect.github.com/devversion) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/pull/807](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/pull/807)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/compare/v3.5.3...v3.6.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation -

They all live together in an Nx monorepository. It is the responsibility of one of these applications to handle user login. For ease of development, we have long configured each app and their proxies to handle forwarding to every other app, so that developers can start whichever apps are relevant to the work they are doing, log in using that app on its own port, and then navigate to other apps without needing to manually type a different port.\n\nI hope this makes sense, I can try to explain more clearly if it doesn't. The important part is that we nearly always have more than one app running, and no matter which app's dev-server port you are on, they will always be able to forward requests intended for apps other than themselves. To achieve this each app has a unique base path which the proxy configuration uses to determine where to send requests.\n\nWe recently switched from the `browser` builder to the new `application` builder, and as a consequence the `dev-server` now uses Vite rather than Webpack. On the whole this has all been a great, apart from one thing: hot module reloading is broken cross-app.\n\nI've created and linked a (somewhat minimal) reproduction repository below.\n\nWhile investigating this myself, I noticed that when an app tries to hot update while on the \"wrong\" port, the part that seems to fail is fetching the new JavaScript file. The WebSocket connects just fine, receives the `angular:component-update` event just fine, and makes the request for the updated file just fine. The request even succeeds, actually, but the response is empty. Some screenshots for explanation:\n\n<img width=\"1282\" alt=\"WebSocket connects\" title=\"WebSocket connects\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74259f69-c61a-4bb8-b462-3a8a6dbcd4c0\" />\n\n<img width=\"1281\" alt=\"WebSocket receives update event\" title=\"WebSocket receives update event\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/622cb771-fbac-4595-94e8-f742a4b6d267\" />\n\n<img alt=\"JavaScript response is empty\" title=\"JavaScript response is empty\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a86b6e36-fa04-48a4-ba12-3185d429d2fa\" />\n\nIt's worth noting that `full-reload` events work just fine, which is probably expected given the nature of what's failing about the hot reload.\n\nThat's as far as I've gotten. I'm not sure if there is some proxy configuration that I could do to fix this (I've tried some basic tweaks with no luck), or if this is a bug somewhere that needs to be fixed. But in the meantime, turning HMR off \"fixes\" things for us, though it isn't ideal of course.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you!\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/tmercswims/ng-vite-mono-hmr\n\nIncludes reproduction steps in README.\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.12\nNode: 22.15.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.11\n... common, core, platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.12\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.12\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.12\n@angular/cli                    19.2.12\n@angular/compiler               19.2.11\n@angular/compiler-cli           19.2.11\n@schematics/angular             19.2.12\nrxjs                            7.8.2\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30321","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Running multiple applications which proxy to each other breaks HMR\" (#30321)"},{"Id":"3066733172","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T15:59:33","Actor":"LakshminadhSDx","Number":"30317","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular-devkit/build-angular@19.2.11 not published, causing install errors with @angular/cli@19.2.11","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nnew\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I run ng new my-app, the process fails with the error:\nNo matching version found for @angular-devkit/build-angular@^19.2.11.\nI expected the Angular CLI to create a new project successfully.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nOpen terminal\nRun ng new my-app\nWait for dependencies to install\nSee the error\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nnpm ERR! code ETARGET\nnpm ERR! notarget No matching version found for @angular-devkit/build-angular@^19.2.11.\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.11\nNode: 22.15.1\nPackage Manager: npm 11.0.0\nOS: win32 x64\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nI have not modified any configuration files.\nThis happens with a fresh install of Angular CLI.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9b8c315-3205-4552-8a64-e0dc7ef41664)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30317","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@angular-devkit/build-angular@19.2.11 not published, causing install errors with @angular/cli@19.2.11\" (#30317)"},{"Id":"3065413847","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T13:20:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30316","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove unused function","State":"closed","Body":"Remove unused code\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30316","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove unused function\" (#30316)"},{"Id":"3064924414","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T08:41:18","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30314","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency node to v22.15.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|\n| [node](https://nodejs.org) ([source](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node)) | patch | `22.15.0` -> `22.15.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/node (node)</summary>\n\n### [`v22.15.1`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.15.1): 2025-05-14, Version 22.15.1 &#x27;Jod&#x27; (LTS), @&#8203;RafaelGSS\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/compare/v22.15.0...v22.15.1)\n\nThis is a security release.\n\n##### Notable Changes\n\n-   (CVE-2025-23166) fix error handling on async crypto operation\n-   (CVE-2025-23165) add missing call to uv_fs_req_cleanup\n\n##### Commits\n\n-   \\[[`edaf54da00`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/edaf54da00)] - **fs**: added test for missing call to uv_fs_req_cleanup (Justin Nietzel) [#&#8203;57811](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57811)\n-   \\[[`9f403e98ef`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/9f403e98ef)] - **(CVE-2025-23165)** **fs**: add missing call to uv_fs_req_cleanup (Justin Nietzel) [#&#8203;57811](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57811)\n-   \\[[`f4494d38f1`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/f4494d38f1)] - **(CVE-2025-23166)** **src**: fix error handling on async crypto operations (RafaelGSS) [nodejs-private/node-private#709](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs-private/node-private/pull/709)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

As a result, importing SVGs in specs fails with:\n\n`No loader is configured for \".svg\" files`\n\n**Important:** with the normal build it works perfectly fine.\n\n### Expected Behavior:\n\nThe builderMode: \"application\" and accompanying loader map should be accepted by the test builder’s schema, enabling esbuild to inline or file‐emit .svg imports exactly as in the application build.\n\nSpecs importing SVGs should compile under the esbuild‐powered pipeline without further WebPack tweaks.\n\n[Docs to the implementation example](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration#file-extension-loader-customization)\n[Docs to the test build](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration#new-features)\n\n### Actual Behavior:\n\nThe CLI fails schema validation on angular.json with an error like:\n\n```\nSchema validation failed with the following errors:\n  Data path “/projects/phlu-webapp/architect/test/options” should NOT have additional properties(loader).\n```\nTests continue to use the WebPack‐based Karma builder (which knows nothing about esbuild loaders), so importing an SVG in a spec throws:\n\n`No loader is configured for \".svg\" files`\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n### Component to load the svg\n\n**svg-loader.component.ts**\n\n```\nimport { Component, Input, OnInit } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { DomSanitizer, SafeHtml } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"app-svg-loader\",\n  standalone: true,\n

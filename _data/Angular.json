This results in a \"blank\" screen (or rather, it\r\nonly shows content that is outside the `router-outlet` such as the\r\nstatic app header).\r\n\r\nWith this commit, the router initializer, which includes an `initialNavigation`\r\ncall, now tracks whether the initial navigation succeeded (including\r\nredirects). If the navigation did not succeed, a navigation to the root\r\nof the application is triggered (`'/'`).

My use-case is that I am on a view with a calendar on a view showing an entire month. Since I am showing a month, picking a day is irrelevant\r\n\r\nTo get around the datepicker going to a day view when clicking on a month, you can add a function that runs on the `(monthSelected)` event and calls `datepicker.close()` when fired. This works, but it flashes the day view for a split second before closing. It should just close right away.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nUse the example at the very bottom of the official Material docs for the datepicker:\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/examples\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUse this example that uses Angular Material 8.2.3\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/angular/ekjvrbglvnb?file=src%2Fapp%2Fdatepicker-views-selection-example.ts\r\n\r\nThe datepicker closes immediately upon selecting a month. \r\n\r\nThis is just one that I found when researching this issue. It is possible that versions later than this also work.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe datepicker switches to the day view and then closes.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.0.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25191","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(datepicker): closing datepicker on monthSelected shows day view briefly\" (#25191)"},{"Id":"1288911449","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-29T15:37:49","Actor":"bonomiandreia","Number":"25189","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(DATAPICKER): Select ranges dates for years and months in only one datapicker.","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\r\n\r\nSelect ranges dates for years and months too.\r\n\r\nExample:  if I want only select by years or month, I must NECESSARILY use two date pickers, one for start date and another for end date (I can't add two data pickers in my project).\r\nCurrently, I dont have a choice in angular material to use only one datapicker for the same use (at last, I didn't see this case of use in documentation). \r\nMy suggestion is there is ranges dates for years and months too, as days.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n2020 ~ 2022 = 01/01/2020 to 01/01/2022\r\nmay ~ december = 01/05 to 01/12\r\n\r\nNow, I'm moving from library datapicker because this issue.

It's annoying when the mouse is over a tooltip which causes never closing tooltips. \r\n\r\nMy current solution in global styles:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.mat-tooltip-panel {\r\n  pointer-events: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider to add this to your component. Tooltip is not interactive and I doubt anyone want to select the text. We could treat this as bug.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nTooltips can overlay other element. For example action buttons in a table. It's bad UX when you move your mouse to an button, but cannot clicked because the tooltip of another element overlaps it. \r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| :-: | :-: |\r\n|![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60390085/176159370-6cf176ad-9c1c-4105-a986-ef72999e56f7.gif)|![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60390085/176159369-f3a15be6-91c9-492d-8d68-14f94cf2f5ba.gif)|\r\n| 👎 | 👍 |\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25173","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"improve(tooltip): Prevent mouse over tooltip.\" (#25173)"},{"Id":"1287851910","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T20:37:34","Actor":"devversion","Number":"25183","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix loose yarn engine range","State":"closed","Body":"Renovate incorrectly is fine using Yarn 2+ for the components\r\nrepo because our enignes field is too loose.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25183","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix loose yarn engine range\" (#25183)"},{"Id":"1287831938","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T20:14:29","Actor":"rmeshksar","Number":"25182","RawContent":null,"Title":"cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport: modified items, get mixed up when scrolling","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a list with virtual scrolling. \r\nUpon clicking on an item, a class is getting added to that item in order to highlight it.\r\nBut upon scrolling up and down, some other items are also highlighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

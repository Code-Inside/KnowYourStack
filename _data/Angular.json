Most videos will simply run from start and not at the setted currentTime position. This is only the case when videos are delivered/fetched by the service worker. So it works in development mode.\"\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #25865\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nAdded logic to **driver.ts** in the worker src folder that does the following:\r\n\r\nThe  `onFetch` method now: \r\n\r\n- Checks for Range headers in incoming requests.\r\n\r\n- Calls the `handleRangeRequest` function if a Range header is present.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newly added `handleRangeRequest` function:  \r\n\r\n- Parses the Range header to determine the requested byte range.\r\n\r\n- Fetches the full content and extracts the requested byte range.\r\n\r\n- Constructs a response with the appropriate Content-Range and Content-Length headers.\r\n\r\n- Returns a 206 Partial Content response with the requested byte range.\r\n\r\nThese changes ensure that the service worker can handle Range requests, allowing videos to start at the specified `currentTime` when delivered by the service worker as well as fixing seeking.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded test logic to **ngsw-worker.js** which can handle mock range header handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\nShould not be a breaking change","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60029","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(service-worker): update service worker to handle seeking better for videos\" (#60029)"},{"Id":"2864742581","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-20T00:57:32","Actor":"atscott","Number":"60028","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Ensure fake navigation is not aborted after it succeeds","State":"open","Body":"The navigate event was only ever being cleared when a new navigation happened.

The vulnerability can also be mitigated by using the following best practices to harden the web pages: \n• Set a DOCTYPE which does not allow Quirks mode as explained at https://hsivonen.fi/doctype/ \n• Set response header X-Frame-Options: deny • Set response header X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.\n\nApplication is as per rules provided above still qualys scan issue is produced\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60008","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Qualys Scan Issues > Path-relative stylesheet import (PRSSI) vulnerability\" (#60008)"},{"Id":"2862400776","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-19T07:05:12","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"60009","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): add `token` to missing injection context error message","State":"open","Body":"In this commit, we add injector token information to the error message to improve debugging and context awareness, because it is hard to capture the `inject()` stack trace in asynchronous contexts.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/60009","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): add `token` to missing injection context error message\" (#60009)"},{"Id":"2861881601","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-18T23:42:15","Actor":"bencodezen","Number":"60006","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add new routing in-depth guides","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Download the project from StackBlitz.\n2. Start it and open in the Edge browser. Open the deprecated \"Detached elements\" tool.\n3. Drag an item from the \"To do\" column to the \"In progress\" column and then to \"Done\".\n4. Collect garbage in the \"Detached elements\" tool and check detached items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere are no detached nodes related to the cdk-drag element.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere are 2 `cdk-drag-dragging` detached nodes. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0fb8a7e-869d-4858-b1f0-b2d79177eb53)\n\nThe same result will be achieved if performed in Chrome, but more details can be seen in the Edge. If the \"Analyze\" button is clicked - you will get an id to the retainer (instead of the initial text \"Object not found in memory anymore\"). Double-clicking on it will show the retainer info. In this case, it's the `CdkDropList._dropListRef._draggables` array.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f25936c-c259-46f6-955a-73de1381b42b)\n\n**Some info after my analysis**: `_draggables` are set in the `DropListRef`'s `withItems` method.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56971d06-deaf-4f0d-86b8-8e73101221ed)\n\nWhile debugging I should have entered it via `_syncItemsWithRef`, but there's a `this._dropListRef.isDragging()` condition in the `removeItem` method. In my case, I've already dropped an item and it's no longer dragging. Therefore `_draggables` are not updated and there's a `cdk-drag` detached node because of that.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65010937-ced3-4911-bd12-4ef965ab2085)\n\nI'm not sure if that condition should be there at all, cause surely we need to sync items with ref **not only when dragging is in progress**. Here's a [link to the commit](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/d1a6ea74db0881001bf02ff113f269552effc4f6) where those changes were added.\n\nFor my project, I monkey-patched `removeItem` method and removed `isDragging()` condition.

This limitation forces me to rely on the `!important` keyword to override these styles, which isn’t ideal.\n\nIs there a recommended approach or a potential enhancement to allow these inline styles to be assigned to a specific CSS layer by default?\n\nHere’s an example for reference:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/717631b1-a250-4182-bd59-19ed22fb5be2)\n\nThank you for the help!\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce a configuration option that allows developers to specify a CSS layer for the injected Material components' styles. Instead of inserting these styles without layer information, the library would wrap them in a `<style>` tag with the appropriate CSS layer attribute (e.g., `layer=\"material\"`). This change would enable more predictable cascading behavior and simplify style overrides by eliminating the need for `!important`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- **Overriding with `!important`**: Currently, developers rely on using `!important` to override the default styles. However, this approach can lead to maintenance issues and unintended side effects.\n- **Manual style injection**: Developers could manually override or inject additional CSS rules after the default styles load, but this solution is error-prone and lacks scalability.\n- **Custom style injection**: Overriding the internal style injection mechanism might be possible, but this would be a hacky workaround that could break with future updates.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30512","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Possibility to set all Material's CSS in a specific CSS layer\" (#30512)"},{"Id":"2856807325","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-18T10:59:55","Actor":"kiarash-malekzadeh","Number":"30499","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelect): MatSelectTrigger does not show the initial default value","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI have this code with mat-select which has a text inside the mat-select-trigger.

stays opened.  \n\nI expected the same behavior like with the MatDatePicker, if the picker panel is opened, when using Escape the picker is closed first, and then using Escape again closes the sideNav.\n\nI also provide the same sample inside a Dialog using the MatSelect and MatDatePicker and in this case, both works the same way and correctly.\n\nThe issue seems related to this

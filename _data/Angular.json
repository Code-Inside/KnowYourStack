For example, you may have a  `window.onmessage` event handler that receives data from a worker or an `IFRAME`. The handler then iterates through the array of received objects, invoking various callbacks or emitting observable values for each one. If one of those callbacks or subscribers is part of an Angular app and needs to update something that should be picked up by Angular's change detection, they would wrap it in the `NgZone.run()` call.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39348","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[perf] NgZone: runaway change detections\" (#39348)"},{"Id":"725850324","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-20T18:39:02","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"39346","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ngcc): capture UMD/CommonJS inner class implementation nodes correctly","State":"open","Body":"Previously, UMD/CommonJS class inline declarations of the form:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexports.Foo = (function() { function Foo(); return Fool; })();\r\n```\r\n\r\nwere capturing the whole IIFE as the implementation, rather than\r\nthe inner class (i.e. `function Foo() {}` in this case).

This introduces the following issues:\r\n\r\n1. Any time something called `$any` is used, it'll be stripped away, leaving only the first parameter.\r\n2. If something called `$event` is used anywhere in a template, it'll be preserved as `$event`, rather than being rewritten to `ctx.$event`, causing the value to undefined at runtime. This applies to listener, property and text bindings.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the first issue and part of the second one by preserving anything that is accessed through `this`, even if it's one of the \"special\" ones like `$any` or `$event`.

","State":"open","Body":"\r\nIn my application , lazy loading was perfectly working in Angular 4  . However , after I migrated to Angular 7 , the lazy loading and routing has stopped working when I use ng serve.\r\n\r\nThe routes for the application are defined in `app.module.ts` like this  :\r\n\r\n\t\t\t    RouterModule.forRoot([\r\n\t\t\t\t  { path: 'info/:gitCode/:pemCode/:getRtComponent', component: RedComponent },\r\n\t\t\t\t  { path: 'info/:gitCode/:pemCode/:getFaq/:getRtComponent', component: RedComponent },\r\n\t\t\t\t  { path: 'loadGuardsInfo/:gitCode/:pemCode/:getRtComponent', component: RedComponent },\r\n\t\t\t\t  { path: 'loadGuardsInfo/:getRtComponent', component: RedComponent },\r\n\t\t\t\t  { path: 'recDet', component: RecDetComponent },\r\n\t\t\t\t  { path: 'SlaveComponent/:pfScreen', loadChildren: './ally/slave/slave.module#SlaveModule' },\r\n\t\t\t\t  { path: 'MasterComponent/:pfScreen', loadChildren: './ally/master/master.module#MasterModule' },\r\n\t\t\t\t  { path: 'DashedComponent/:pfScreen', loadChildren: './ally/dashed/dashed.module#DashedModule' }\r\n\t\t\t\t  ])\r\n\t\t\t  ],\r\n\t\t\t  providers: [ReqService, { provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: './' }, {\r\n\t\t\t\tprovide: ErrorHandler,\r\n\t\t\t\tuseClass: GlobalErrorHandler\r\n\t\t\t  }, { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }],\r\n\t\t\t  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\r\n\t\t\t  exports: []\r\n\r\nI have gone through a lot of articles on the internet about this and tried out a lot of things , but none worked . \r\n\r\nWhen I first try ng serve, I just get 6 chunks : `main.js, polyfills.js, runtime.js, scripts.js, styles.js and vendor.js` along with various typescript errors (I am okay with typescript errors since they are coming up as typescript has been updated from 2.4 to 3.1 and according to me they are expected and can be resolved) . What's strange is : when I now go to the `app.module.ts`, where my routes are mentioned and just try : CONTROL+S by introducing some blank characters using backspace , then all the lazy loading named chunks start showing up in the terminal . This issue is very similar to the issue that was reported by @ceyhunn here : https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27023#issuecomment-491206139\r\n\r\nAlso , every lazy loaded  module , has a routing established in it like(e.g. for `SlaveModule`) :\r\n\r\n     RouterModule.forChild([\r\n      {path:'', component:SlaveComponent}\r\n     ])\r\n\r\n**Before the upgrade :**\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n**After the upgrade :**\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nCan the angular experts here tell me as to what's going wrong and how can I solve these issues ?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2N3We.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQrjl.png\r\n\r\nI have raised the question in stackoverflow as well, but got no answer : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64440466/angular-7-why-does-lazy-loading-compilation-does-not-generate-chunks","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19145","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 7 : lazy loading compilation does not generate chunks without a force load. \" (#19145)"},{"Id":"726024874","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-21T00:01:48","Actor":"clydin","Number":"19144","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): coerce prompt answers to requested property types","State":"open","Body":"This change converts answers from prompts into the property type requested from the schema.

`esModule` option is `true` by default, you need to change `const locals = require('./styles.css')`/`require('./styles.css')` on `import locals from './styles.css'`/`import './styles.css''`\n-   the `moduleFilename` option was removed in favor the `filename` option\n-   the `hmr` option was removed, HMR will work automatically when `HotModuleReplacement` plugin used or `webpack-dev-server` with enabled the `hot` option\n-   the `reloadAll` was removed\n\n##### Features\n\n-   the `chunkFilename` option can be a function for webpack@5\n\n##### ‚ö† NOTICE\n\nTo avoid problems between `mini-css-extract-plugin` and `style-loader` because of changing the `esModule` option to `true` by default we strongly recommend upgrading `style-loader` to `2.0.0` version.\n\n#####

Listen to screen reader, it will read No correctly\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\nIt should read label and then position. For my example, it should read, \"No, three of four\"\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n\r\nIt reads, \"Number three of Four\". It looks like it is translating No to Number which is a shorthand for Number.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.0\r\nCDK/Material: 10.2.0\r\nBrowser(s): Chrome  86.0.4240.75\r\nOperating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\nChromeVox: 53.0.2784.6\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20815","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"MAT-OPTION: Screen reader announces an option with label of \"No\" as \"Number\"\" (#20815)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-10-21T05:30:04.6300254Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2578}

The removal of the unified Tailwind detection system and introduction of PostCSS config discovery created an ecosystem compatibility gap.\n\nThis isn't a request to fix third-party tools, but rather:\n- Documentation request: How should build system integrators adapt to v21 changes?\n- Ecosystem impact awareness: Significant breaking change affecting Angular + Bazel projects\n- Migration guidance: What's the recommended integration pattern for the new PostCSS system?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. setup a new angular project with tailwind\n2. add tailwind directive\n3. configure bazel\n4. compare styles.css from `ng build --configuration production` vs `bazel build //:web-app-build`\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nNo runtime errors, but silently broken functionality. \ntailwind are not processed\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: v21.0.0+\nNode.js: v22.12.0\nBazel: Latest with Aspect Rules JS\nTailwind CSS: v3.3.5\nPostCSS: v8.5.6\nOS: Linux 6.8.0-64-generic\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\nThe v21 changes introduced two new systems that third-party build tools don't implement - https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/49a09737d5412c302d09b40de198251bb99789d1\n1. PostCSS Config Discovery - Searches for postcss.config.json, .postcssrc.json\n2. Modified Automatic Detection - New fallback logic when no config found\n\nEvidence from Investigation:\n✅ File discovery works: Bazel finds tailwind.config.js\n✅ Dependencies available: All PostCSS/Tailwind packages present\n✅ Same execution environment: Verified via sandbox debugging\n❌ Processing pipeline broken: Third-party tools missing new integration logic\n\nImpact on Ecosystem:\n- Affects all Angular projects using Bazel builds with Tailwind\n- Creates build system inconsistency (same code, different output)\n- No migration documentation exists for build system integrators\n- Forces workaround of using only ng build\n\nRequests for Angular CLI Team:\n📚 Documentation: How should third-party build systems implement the new PostCSS discovery?\n🛠️ Migration Guide: What's the recommended integration pattern for build tools?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30802","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI v20.1 PostCSS Integration Changes Break Third-Party Build Systems - Need Migration Guidance\" (#30802)"},{"Id":"3270333608","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-29T14:03:19","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30795","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): skip workspace-specific tools when outside a workspace","State":"closed","Body":"When the MCP server is initialized outside of an Angular workspace, workspace-specific tools such as  `list_projects` should not be registered as they will not function correctly.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/30795","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): skip workspace-specific tools when outside a workspace\" (#30795)"},{"Id":"3273231364","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-29T11:20:34","Actor":"devversion","Number":"30799","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/cli): introduce `setup-gemini-cli` command with a Gemini CLI extension","State":"open","Body":"Introduces `ng ai setup-gemini-cli` that will automatically install the \"Angular Gemini CLI extension\", wiring up Angular best practices and rules that improve code generation.\r\n\r\nIn the future we need to look further into:\r\n\r\n* Documentation\r\n* How we version the extension.

Since I am not hosting the application on the firebase domain, certain steps for self-hosting the auth files to allow redirect sign-in are required. (See readme link of repro, these changes were required because of the third-party cookie blocking introduced by browsers)\n\nFor that I downloaded the auth files and placed them as described and defined them as static assets.

A chip has two slots to display icons using content projection. All variants of chips support adding icons including \\<mat-chip\\>, \\<mat-chip-option\\>, and \\<mat-chip-row\\>.\n\nThis suggests two possible slots for a `<mat-icon>` (leading or trailing the chip text). However, this doesn't work in practice, and looking at the [template code](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/chips/chip.html) suggests that the chip only supports an _avatar_ in the leading slot (despite the documentation stating \"icon\"). \n\nWhen you try to add an icon rather than an avatar, it's not aligned correctly. Adding the `matChipAvatar` directive doesn't help as the icon is clipped to a circle (and the alignment is still off).\n\nIn my opinion, a chip should support projecting an instance of `MatIcon` on the leading side (in fact, it's show in the [MD spec](https://m3.material.io/components/chips/overview)). However, as it stands the documentation is misleading as to the current behaviour.\n\n<img width=\"1360\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d002fc-7331-411d-97f4-8a918d063691\" />\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/gqzwx38r?file=src%2Fexample%2Fchips-avatar-example.html\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/components/chips/overview#adding-up-to-two-icons-with-content-projection","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(chips): MatChip does not natively support leading icon despite docs\" (#31628)"},{"Id":"3279420855","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-31T07:28:46","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31627","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(cdk/drag-drop): scrollable example not showing","State":"open","Body":"Fixes that the scrollable example wasn't showing up properly, because it wasn't exported from the index file.\r\n\r\nFixes #31619.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31627","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(cdk/drag-drop): scrollable example not showing\" (#31627)"},{"Id":"3279142506","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-31T05:09:54","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31626","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency firebase-tools to v14.11.2","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [firebase-tools](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) | devDependencies | patch | [`14.11.1` -> `14.11.2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/firebase-tools/14.11.1/14.11.2) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>firebase/firebase-tools (firebase-tools)</summary>\n\n### [`v14.11.2`](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/releases/tag/v14.11.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/compare/v14.11.1...v14.11.2)\n\n- Fixed ext:export command so that it correctly returns system params in the .env file ([#&#8203;8881](https://redirect.github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/8881))\n- Fixed an issue where the MCP server could not successfully use Application Default Credentials.

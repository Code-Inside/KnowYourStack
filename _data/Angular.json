On receipt, client needs to be able to decrypt the content before passing to normal 'showNotification' flow. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe simplest solution in my mind would be a callback that allows you to modify the notification payload before continuing to show it. Part of SwPush, though itd have to run when application is closed so Im not sure that would work. An even better solution would be to officially support extending the service worker module, as there are other issues with specific service worker niche use cases that could be solved by just supporting service worker extensions.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nManually updating service worker or adding custom service worker with importScripts.

Internally these are translated into Go regular expressions. However, this translation previously ignored the `flags` property of the regular expression. With this release, esbuild will now translate JavaScript regular expression flags into Go regular expression flags. Specifically the JavaScript regular expression `/\\.[jt]sx?$/i` is turned into the Go regular expression `` `(?i)\\.[jt]sx?$` `` internally inside of esbuild's API. This should make it possible to use JavaScript regular expressions with the `i` flag. Note that JavaScript and Go don't support all of the same regular expression features, so this mapping is only approximate.\n\n-   Fix node-specific annotations for string literal export names ([#&#8203;4100](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4100))\n\n    When node instantiates a CommonJS module, it scans the AST to look for names to expose via ESM named exports. This is a heuristic that looks for certain patterns such as `exports.NAME = ...` or `module.exports = { ... }`. This behavior is used by esbuild to \"annotate\" CommonJS code that was converted from ESM with the original ESM export names. For example, when converting the file `export let foo, bar` from ESM to CommonJS, esbuild appends this to the end of the file:\n\n    ```js\n    // Annotate the CommonJS export names for ESM import in node:\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      bar,\n      foo\n    });\n    ```\n\n    However, this feature previously didn't work correctly for export names that are not valid identifiers, which can be constructed using string literal export names. The generated code contained a syntax error. That problem is fixed in this release:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    let foo\n    export { foo as \"foo!\" }\n\n    // Old output (with --format=cjs --platform=node)\n    ...\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      \"foo!\"\n    });\n\n    // New output (with --format=cjs --platform=node)\n    ...\n    0 && (module.exports = {\n      \"foo!\": null\n    });\n    ```\n\n-   Basic support for index source maps ([#&#8203;3439](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3439), [#&#8203;4109](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4109))\n\n    The source map specification has an optional mode called [index source maps](https://tc39.es/ecma426/#sec-index-source-map) that makes it easier for tools to create an aggregate JavaScript file by concatenating many smaller JavaScript files with source maps, and then generate an aggregate source map by simply providing the original source maps along with some offset information. My understanding is that this is rarely used in practice. I'm only aware of two uses of it in the wild: [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack/).\n\n    This release provides basic support for indexed source maps. However, the implementation has not been tested on a real app (just on very simple test input). If you are using index source maps in a real app, please try this out and report back if anything isn't working for you.\n\n    Note that this is also not a complete implementation. For example, index source maps technically allows nesting source maps to an arbitrary depth, while esbuild's implementation in this release only supports a single level of nesting. It's unclear whether supporting more than one level of nesting is important or not given the lack of available test cases.\n\n    This feature was contributed by

([f767d3c](https://redirect.github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/f767d3cff7bf521e188a662472edc4524555e834))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   remove Node.js v18 support ([69d9d9e](https://redirect.github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/69d9d9ee74c4e6b25eda3768b25501b1494002cc))\n-   update minimum supported Node.js 22 version to 22.11.0 ([a836a71](https://redirect.github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/commit/a836a71ccd753f425227c684fdfb017bfc017f8f))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server (webpack-dev-server)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.2.1`](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#521-2025-03-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v5.2.0...v5.2.1)\n\n##### Security\n\n-   cross-origin requests are not allowed unless allowed by `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header\n-   requests with an IP addresses in the `Origin` header are not allowed to connect to WebSocket server unless configured by `allowedHosts` or it different from the `Host` header\n\nThe above changes may make the dev server not work if you relied on such behavior, but unfortunately they carry security risks, so they were considered as fixes.\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   prevent overlay for errors caught by React error boundaries ([#&#8203;5431](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/5431)) ([8c1abc9](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/8c1abc903ab444d9ce99e567b9a6c603e1ec06be))\n-   take the first network found instead of the last one, this restores the same behavior as 5.0.4 ([#&#8203;5411](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/5411))

Locally reverting that change fixes the issue and you get the earlier behavior.\n\nThe use case may be little bit unconventional, but we have separate list for \"items to buy\" and then items for being in \"shopping basket\" (using one of the examples in website). They are in different components and connected by one parent component. Everything works greatly until the \"product selection\" component is destroyed. It works when there are sane number of items ,say 500. But when there are over 4000 items, the browser becomes unusable.\n\nI'm able to repro this same behavior in Stackblitz. Though, it needs a lot more items before it starts to break: 40000.\n\nOur actual code is years old, so it may be that it would be instructed to write it another way. \n\nIs there a way that `this._syncItemsWithRef();` would not be called for every item in a row if it happens really quickly? Or is there a better way to disconnect the drop lists before the component is destroyed?

For example, when I click to collapse parent 1, the structure of the tree view is re-rendered as:\n```\n- parent 1\n\n- parent 2\n   - leaf 2-1\n   - leaf 2-2\n```\n> link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/qfnq49si-ubbjqylv?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-tree-flat-children-accessor-example.ts\n\n\n**Extra** 📝\n\n Although I see that the [official demo](https://material.angular.io/cdk/tree/examples#cdk-tree-nested-level-accessor) hides nodes that don't need to be displayed by a combination of `style.display` and `shouldRender`.\n\nI think this is still a problem. Because in Demo 1 you have to use `style.display` and `shouldRender` to render correctly, while in Demo 2 you can render correctly without them. \n\nSo I think there is a difference in this behaviour that is problematic.\n\nThe same problem exists for `TreeControl`, but we can pass only specific node data into the tree's `dataStream` based on the treeControl's record of the node's isExpanded status.\n\n**Possible problem location** 🤔\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/538b8bcd6e14044cc3dce87409eeac40f27941cf/src/cdk/tree/tree.ts#L1093-L1103\n\nThe `flattenedNodes` and `renderNodes` are both equal to `nodes`，maybe we should create a method like `shouldRender` that determines which nodes should be rendered and assigns them to `renderNodes`?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nsee **Desciption**\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCorrectly render visible nodes in the tree when expanding or collapsing nodes\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen use `levelAccessor` with flat data, can not render visible nodes in the tree correctly when expanding or collapsing nodes. But use `childrenAccessor` with nested data, correctly.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-tree): cdk tree with levelAccessor only renders all nodes and cant render based on the expanded state\" (#30735)"},{"Id":"2954430359","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-27T21:12:09","Actor":"rileyajones","Number":"30734","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a null check to autocomplete options","State":"open","Body":"If a mat-autocomplete element does not contain any mat-options it will throw a null pointer when it is unloaded.

Something like this:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6998f786-097a-4fe3-a91f-e78457b526c2)\n\nPost MDC migration of our project, the selected options have started coming in blue color (mat-selected class getting added) which is fine. But since there is a custom function written for this clear-icon-click, although we set the control value to null/undefined and the value is updated properly in the control, still the selected classes are not getting removed. So, even if there is no option selected, the previously selected option still has the selected classes, when dropdown is opened. I used the hideSingleSelectionIndicator, hence tick is not present.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1736f4b7-3c57-43f5-819e-5d6ada9d6b0e)\n\nTo counter this, I used the below code in my clear function : \n\n`this.autocompleteRef?.options.find((data: MatOption) => data.selected)?.deselect();`\n\nNow, on clearing the field, the field gets cleared properly and the 'selected-related' classes are removed from that option in the dropdown but a flickering thing happening. \n\n### How can we avoid it ??? \n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click on the field to open the drodown panel.\n2. Select the first option from the dropdown. (cause this only happens with the first option)\n3. Again try to click on the field so that dropdown opens with only that option in the dropdown.\n4. While the dropdown panel is in opened state, click on the clear icon. It flickers the dropdown.\n\nBelow is the example:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e42ae5-14ff-40e3-8be9-bec6fcb78157\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOn clear icon click, it should re-open the dropdown with all the options without any flickering\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn clear icon click, there is a flicker in the dropdown section and the autocomplete dropdown panel ultimately gets closed.\n\n### Environment\n\n- \"@angular/forms\": \"16.2.12\",\n- \"@angular/material\": \"16.2.14\",\n- \"@angular/cdk\": \"16.2.14\",\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30721","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-autocomplete): Removing the selected option manually adds a flicker in the dropdown rendering.\" (#30721)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-03-31T03:30:02.3864076Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1700}

It would be cool if template editor supported standard way how deprecated code should be marked in TS/JS, using JSDoc [@deprecated](https://github.com/deprecated) feature. This would help working in enterprise grade environment when there are multiple components and some of these should no longer be used. Currently it is very easy to forget/overlook such usage. Displaying it somehow in editor in straightforward way would help a lot.\n> \n> ### Feature Type\n> Display somehow that component is deprecated.\n> \n> ### Describe the solution you'd like\n> I believe the standard way of displaying would be fine, similar way as vscode does for TS/JS code. Currently WebStorm supports it and it looks like in the screenshot: ![image](https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/assets/68107706/96a3d6f6-725c-4cf6-84b6-dd5074d50531)\n> \n> It supports standard way of marking elements as deprecated using JSDoc [@deprecated](https://github.com/deprecated) feature. For example:\n> \n> /**\n>  * @deprecated DO NOT USE THIS TABLE.\n>  */\n> @Component({\n>   selector: 'app-table-old',\n>   templateUrl: './old-table.component.html',\n>   styleUrls: ['./old-table.component.scss']\n> })\n\nFYI @Mr1008\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThis could be implemented as a rule that provides diagnostics with deprecated tags that are then shown in the IDE, similar as happens in Typescript files.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo alternatives in VS Code.\n\nThe functionality seems to be available in Webstorm, sounds like they have a forked or extended version of the language service. It would be good to have this in the base language service so more IDEs can have this functionality.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59343","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Show deprecated template items in IDE\" (#59343)"},{"Id":"2764513164","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-31T16:14:15","Actor":"imran8811","Number":"59342","RawContent":null,"Title":"Broken link in docs","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\n<img width=\"658\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb1b4476-3b2e-4fcb-a7ee-f0f8974583e3\" />\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59342","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Broken link in docs\" (#59342)"},{"Id":"2764263513","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-31T11:53:16","Actor":"walid385","Number":"59340","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update README.md","State":"closed","Body":"Added:\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/experimental/zoneless\r\n\r\nCloses [59339](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59339)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This validator checks if the value of a form control matches one of the allowed values from a list, which can be an array of numbers, strings, or an object.\n\nThe validator would return an error object if the value of the control is not included in the allowed values list, and it will include both the invalid value and the allowed values in the response.\n\nThis feature can be useful when you want to restrict input to a specific set of values but need the flexibility to support different types (numbers, strings, or objects).\n\n### Feature Details:\n\n1. **Validator Function:**\n\n```typescript\nexport function oneOfValidator(value: number[] | string[] | object): ValidatorFn {\n  const values: number[] | string[] = toOneOfList(value);\n\n  return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {\n    // Check if the control is valid and has a value\n    if (control && control.value) {\n      const value: string = control.value;\n\n      // Check if the control's value is not in the list of allowed values\n      if (!value.includes(value)) {\n        // Return an object containing the invalid value and allowed values\n        return { oneOf: value, allowedValues: values };\n      }\n    }\n    // Return null if the value is valid or the control is not set\n    return null;\n  };\n}\n\nstatic oneOf(value: number[] | string[] | object): ValidatorFn {\n  return oneOfValidator(value);\n}\n\nfunction toOneOfList(value: number[] | string[] | object): number[] | string[] {\n  let valuesArray: number[] | string[] = [];\n  if (typeof value === 'object' && !Array.isArray(value)) {\n    valuesArray = Object.keys(value);\n  } else if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n    valuesArray = value;\n  }\n  return valuesArray;\n}\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### Simple Usage Example:\n\n```typescript\n// Using oneOf with an array of numbers\noneOf([1, 2, 3]);\n\n// Using oneOf with an array of strings\noneOf(['a', 'b', 'c']);\n\n// Using oneOf with an enum\nenum Gender {\n  Male = 'Male',\n  Female = 'Female',\n  Other = 'Other'\n}\n\noneOf(Gender);\n````\n\n### Alternatives Considered:\n\n1. Custom ngModel Validator: Considered implementing a custom validator for each form control directly in the component. However, this would lead to more verbose code and less reusability across different form controls.\n\n2. Manual Value Checking in Components: Another option was manually checking if the control's value is in the allowed list within the component, but this would require repetitive code and diminish maintainability.\n\n3. Third-Party Validation Libraries: Considered using external libraries for form validation, but chose not to introduce dependencies, preferring to keep the solution within Angular's built-in form validation system for simplicity and consistency.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59332","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add `oneOfValidator` for validating control values against a set of allowed values\" (#59332)"},{"Id":"2762971809","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-30T10:44:55","Actor":"mshavliuk","Number":"59330","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nested `@if` breaks multi-slot content projection","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using nested `@if` control flow blocks with content projection (`<ng-content select=\"...\">`), the projected content does not get correctly selected compared to using a single `@if`.

Create a parent component that uses this child component in two ways:\n   - With a single condition: `<app-clild> @if (true) {<div class='slot'>Slot content</div>}</app-clild>`\n   - With nested conditions: `<app-clild> @if (true) { @if (true) {<div class='slot'>Slot content</div>} }</app-clild>`\n\n## Expected Behavior\nBoth approaches should result in identical DOM structures where the projected `<div class='slot'>Slot content</div>` is visible\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- Single condition works correctly: `Slot content` is projected\n- Nested conditions fail: `Slot content` is not shown\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-xsmwxmhw?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.6\nNode: 20.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.6\n@angular/cli                    19.0.6\n@schematics/angular             19.0.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59330","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nested `@if` breaks multi-slot content projection\" (#59330)"},{"Id":"2762525784","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-30T01:07:37","Actor":"sumitarora","Number":"59329","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(devtools): fixing dark mode colors for devtools and router tree","State":"open","Body":"- added dark mode colors for devtools and router tree  \r\n- fixed the router tree legend rerendering issue\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1331\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/188f3005-8f3e-4d02-a99e-7b3197dbdf61\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"871\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/484ab358-640d-4ea3-a658-49216a176e09\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1170\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e02efff-77dc-4fe6-a90a-7647b14e7d67\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59329","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(devtools): fixing dark mode colors for devtools and router tree\" (#59329)"},{"Id":"2761828674","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-28T18:30:52","Actor":"Char2sGu","Number":"59328","RawContent":null,"Title":"NgIf Else Block Breaks Hydration","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncommon\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nThe new built-in `@if` block seems to ignore the `@else` block during hydration, ensuring an consistent markup structure after the application becomes stable.

The problem arises during the build process when the JavaScriptOptimizerPlugin is included in the Webpack configuration. Specifically, the following error occurs:\n\nError: NullInjectorError: No provider for Mr!\n\nProblem Details\nThe issue appears to be related to the following block in node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/common.js:\n\n`const extraMinimizers = [];\nif (scriptsOptimization) {\n    extraMinimizers.push(new plugins_1.JavaScriptOptimizerPlugin({\n        define: {\n            ...(buildOptions.aot ?

After switching to V19 I wanted to move to `AngularNodeAppEngine` to be able to have hybrid rendering but I'm facing an issue with dynamic route paths.\n\nThe app we are working on, by default, has no pre-defined route paths. They all come from an API. The end user can edit all the slugs of its app on a dedicated interface.\n\nSo, during `APP_INITIALIZER` we fetch the routes from the API and `Router.resetConfig`.\nThis is working using `CommonEngine`.\n\nBut it doesn't when using AngularNodeAppEngine because of the route extraction phase during build time to feed the Manifest in this scenario.\n\nWhen the app is built, let's say the end user has only activated one route `routeA`. The server manifest has only a route.\n\nBut after some time, the end user chose to add another route to the app (`routeB`). During `APP_INITIALIZER` the route is correctly added to the router config, but since it's not part of the manifest, `routeB` leads to a 404 on SSR.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI added a repo to highlight the issue : https://github.com/jimjim2a/ssr-dynamic-routing.\n\nHere are the steps to reproduce the issue : \n\n1. Build the app -> at this time route extraction knows only \"article\" route\n2. open the \"/article\" page -> During app initializer we now add a second route (\"video\")\n3. Click on the \"Go to Video page !\" button -> This works since the second route is added on CSR\n4. Refresh the \"/video\" page -> This path can not be found and leads to a 404\n\nWe are in case there both SSR and CSR Router has correct configuration, but since the manifest extracted during build time is not complete, the SSR of the newly added route leads to 404.\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.0.6\nNode: 20.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.6\n@angular/cli                    19.0.6\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.6\n@schematics/angular             19.0.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\nThanks everyone for all the great Job you're doing !","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29238","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AngularNodeAppEngine : dynamic route paths added with Router.resetConfig during AppInitializer can't be reached on SSR\" (#29238)"},{"Id":"2763535252","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-30T18:05:54","Actor":"filipsobol","Number":"29237","RawContent":null,"Title":"Duplicate dependencies in server bundle","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI'm the author of [Sonda](https://sonda.dev/), a bundle visualizer and analyzer for JavaScript and CSS. I was asked to create an integration with Angular, which I did here: https://github.com/filipsobol/sonda/issues/48.\n\nOne of the features of Sonda is that it warns about duplicate dependencies that seem to exist in the server bundle(s) in a fresh Angular project. This is probably unintentional.\n\nBelow is a list of dependencies that are bundled in more than one version.\n\nWhen using `npm`:\n\n![npm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85355763-d9b7-4667-9655-f746762cffdf)\n\nWhen using `pnpm`:\n\n![pnpm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c8bfcb-c6a9-4728-855d-22f4895308ed)\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create a new Angular app.\n2. Install the integration following this guide: https://sonda.dev/frameworks/angular-cli.html.\n3. Generate and open a report.\n4. See the warning in the top-left corner and inspect the file `dist/<PROJECT>/server/server.mjs`.\n\n(Steps 2 and 3 may change once I release the integration).\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.0.6\nNode: 20.18.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 19.0.5\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.6\n@angular/cli                    19.0.6\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.6\n@schematics/angular             19.0.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29237","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Duplicate dependencies in server bundle\" (#29237)"},{"Id":"2762194611","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-29T10:35:34","Actor":"AmitMY","Number":"29236","RawContent":null,"Title":"SSG allow loading static assets","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17\n\n### Description\n\nI am using [transloco](https://github.com/jsverse/transloco) for localization.\nWhen building (used to be prerendering) now the build process tries to render the pages.\nIn doing so, it hits this loader, which loads a static asset (the language in question)\n```ts\n@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})\nexport class HttpLoader implements TranslocoLoader {\n  private http = inject(HttpClient);\n\n  getTranslation(langPath: string): Observable<Translation> {\n    return this.http.get<Translation>(`assets/i18n/${langPath}.json`);\n  }\n}\n```\nHowever, the HTTP request fails, since there seems to not be an http server involved in the SSG process.\n\nIf I run this in SSR, it also fails, but that is because it can't handle the path, and requires a full URL (http://localhost:4000/assets/...)\n\nIf I accept not having a server, I need to have a similar behavior to what I do during testing:\n```ts\n    if (isPlatformServer(this.platformId)) {\n      const path = require('path');\n      const filePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', assetPath);\n      console.error('filePath', filePath);\n      const fs = require('fs');\n\n      const data = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');\n      return of(JSON.parse(data));\n    }\n```\n\nBut this relies on node modules, and the builder errors:\n>   The package \"fs\" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node. Are you trying to bundle for node? You can use \"platform: 'node'\" to do that, which will remove this error.\n\n\n\nTherefore, my issues are:\n\n1. SSG should have some sort of way to load static assets. \n2.

This project contains ten thousand components, which are distributed into one hundred modules. These codes take up approximately 20MB of disk space. When I execute the default dev-server builder, it takes about 300 seconds or so. Then, when performing an incremental build after modifying the files for the first time, it also takes around 300 seconds to complete the build. And the incremental compilation time after modifying the files later is about 15 seconds or so. Moreover, it occupies a huge amount of memory. The processes of Node.js and Esbuild take up approximately 14GB of memory.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/xjlzy/test.git\nThis is the git repository address of my local test code. You just need to run it and you'll be able to know the specific situation.

However, all components appear too dark regardless of the target color, and there is no single-line solution to specify a base color tone for all components since `--mat-sys-primary` is hardcoded to the tone value `40` by the theme mixin.\n\nUnfortunately, with Material v19, picking colors from the theme no longer works. You can still specify a material theme using `$app-theme: mat.define-theme(...)` with some restrictions, but applying it using the new mixin `@include mat.theme($app-theme)` doesn't work.\n\n**So please provide clean and simple solution to:**\n\n**1. Specify and reuse a theme object**\nFor example:\n```scss\n// Define theme object\n$app_theme: mat.define-theme((\n color: (primary: $primary-palette), \n...\n)); // Like it was in Material 18\n\n// then use this theme object to apply theme or get theme color:\n@include mat.theme($app-theme);\n$theme-color: mat.get-theme-color($app-theme, primary, 70);\n\n```\n**2. Specify a base color tone for all components at once**\nFor example:\n```scss\n  @include mat.theme((\n    color: (\n      theme-type: light,\n      primary: themes.$app-theme-palette, // Generated color palette\n      primary-color-tone: 70 // Here we specify which tone level to pick from color palette for --mat-sys-primary color\n      ...\n    )\n  ));\n```\n**_or as an alternative_** output all theme-palette tones as css variables, so we can easily reuse them to customize theme and component colors:\n```scss\n  @include mat.theme-overrides((\n    primary: var(--mat-sys-primary-70),\n    on-primary: var(--mat-sys-primary-100)\n  ));\n\n  @include mat.autocomplete-overrides((\n    background-color: var(--mat-sys-primary-80); // or any other custom color\n  ));\n\n```\n\n**3. Specify a base color for a specific component (single-line override)**\nFor example:\n```scss\n  @include mat.autocomplete-overrides((\n    base-color: mat.get-theme-color($theme, primary, 30); // or any other custom color\n  ));\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30244","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(all theming): Clean and reusable way to override all components theme colors\" (#30244)"},{"Id":"2760658468","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-27T09:48:45","Actor":"martinboue","Number":"30241","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(all): Mixins for changing component color","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\n## What I want\nTo easily change the color of a material component.\n\n## Context\nIt is a very common use case to change a material component default color, and migrating from v18 to v19 this was a pain point for me.\n\nBefore in v18, I could change the component color to one in my theme palette like this:\n```\n@include mat.chips-color(theme.$theme, $color-variant: tertiary);\n```\n\nAnd now in v19, I need to specify every tokens:\n```\n@include mat.chips-overrides((\n   elevated-selected-container-color: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary, 90),\n   selected-label-text-color: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary, 10),\n   selected-trailing-icon-color: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary, 10),\n   selected-hover-state-layer-color: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary, 10),\n   selected-trailing-action-state-layer-color: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary, 10),\n   selected-focus-state-layer-color: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary, 10),\n   with-icon-selected-icon-color: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary, 10)\n));\n```\nIt's much more complicated now, and if we want to keep the same level of contrast (here tones 10 and 90) we have to inspect the generated code and find the equivalent in the new color.\n\n## Proposed solution\nIn v18 we had to pick a color from our theme, which wasn't very flexible. An ideal solution would be:\n```\n@include mat.chips-color(#FF0000); // <== We could pass any color here and the mixin would compute the tones\n```\n\nIf not doable, then the same behavior as v18 would be good enough:\n```\n@include mat.chips-color(theme.$palettes, tertiary);\n// or\n$tertiary-palette: map.get(theme.$palettes, tertiary);\n@include mat.chips-color($tertiary-palette);\n```\n\nThere should be one `mat.<component>-color` mixin for each material component.\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(all): Mixins for changing component color\" (#30241)"},{"Id":"2760624124","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-27T09:15:39","Actor":"martinboue","Number":"30240","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(all): Add doc for mixins","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nAdd documentation for all the mixins and explain what they are used for and what the parameters are.

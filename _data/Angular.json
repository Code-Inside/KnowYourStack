Using only `[attr.name]=\"myNameVariable\"` results in only the native attribute being set and so all radio groups have the same name as far as the form control is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe two solutions to this are to use both `[name]` and `[attr.name]` together, or to just use ~~name=\"{{myNameVariable}}\"~~ (just found out while writing this that only `name=\"nonVariableString\"` will set both the attr.name and ng-reflect, using `{{}}` interpolation doesn't work making this extra annoying) which sets both values. This is strange behaviour that isn't immediately obvious. Ideally `[name]` should also set attr.name as well as the ng-reflect.\r\n\r\nI will be honest I am not sure what is happening behind the scenes with this component so I'm not even sure if this is possible or desired but its confusing when standard attribute names are hijacked for angular specific implementation and it prevents the native html from working.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/EUv6daSYS7SC0Ncm\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nI think all versions?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39460","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Radio buttons not applying attr.name when using [name] binding\" (#39460)"},{"Id":"730941011","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T23:15:46","Actor":"jessicajaniuk","Number":"39464","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): Access injected parent values using SkipSelf","State":"open","Body":"In ViewEngine, SelfSkip would navigate up the tree to get tokens from\r\nthe parent node, skipping the child.

Additionally, it's still not possible to change two outlets that appear at different levels in the config in a single navigation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39456","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): Ensure all outlets are used when commands has a prefix\" (#39456)"},{"Id":"730053214","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T16:28:48","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"39443","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(dev-infra): ensure hashbang is present in both published and local ng-devs","State":"closed","Body":"The node hash bang was incidentally removed in the published `ng-dev`, it should\r\nbe included to allow for the command to be run without having to specify node.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39443","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(dev-infra): ensure hashbang is present in both published and local ng-devs\" (#39443)"},{"Id":"730591060","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T16:05:34","Actor":"FabianGosebrink","Number":"39454","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve documentation of NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA","State":"open","Body":"# üìö Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI recently had to fight with tests at a customer and it turned out that the tests only ran because he included the `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` in his tests. The `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` caused the tests to run through but they swallowed every problem in the template, even wrong attributes on components etc.\r\n\r\nThe initial intention was only to skip not provided components to not declare all of them inside the ` TestBed.configureTestingModule({ ... })` `declarations` array. The intention is totally fine IMHO but solving this with `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` results in tests which appear green and maybe do not test anything and leading to weighing the developer in a false security. This case should be solved with the `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`.\r\n\r\nThe documentation shows nothing at the page [https://angular.io/api/core/NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA](https://angular.io/api/core/NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA) and even uses it in the tests shown [https://angular.io/guide/testing-attribute-directives](https://angular.io/guide/testing-attribute-directives) without giving a warning that `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` mostly swallows more than the developer wanted to and may result in false positive tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n[https://angular.io/api/core/NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA](https://angular.io/api/core/NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA)\r\n[https://angular.io/guide/testing-attribute-directives](https://angular.io/guide/testing-attribute-directives)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\nI would expect the documentation to point out to what the difference between `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` and `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` is and that the last one could lead to false results.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39454","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve documentation of NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA\" (#39454)"},{"Id":"730552359","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T15:22:34","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"39453","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add `enableI18nLegacyMessageIdFormat` option to Angular compile‚Ä¶","State":"open","Body":"‚Ä¶r options guide\r\n\r\nThe ViewEngine message extraction generated a variety of legacy formats\r\nfor extracted message ids.

This method falls apart when we want to generate context-sensitive completions, for instance w.r.t. a pipe:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ a | ¬¶ }}\r\n  ^^^     binding pipe span\r\n ^^^^^^^  interpolation span\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe cursor lands in the interpolation, not the pipe, so in the present state, we would provide general interpolation (expression) completions. But clearly, what we really want is completions for pipes.\r\n\r\nThus I propose that what we want to do for completions requests is not find the \"narrowest\" node a cursor is in, but find the \"context\" node of a cursor - namely the node the cursor is \"closest to\".\r\n\r\nSuppose the Angular syntax tree consisted of individual tokens. Then it would be more or less straightforward - just find the nearest token to the left of the cursor, and walk up the token productions if you need an AST node. But okay, our AST has no notion of this, so we need to do something else. Here is my progression of thoughts, with idea 3 being the one I suggest moving forward:\r\n\r\n- Idea 1: when we land in a node, look if there is a child of that node we can ‚Äúpull back‚Äù to \r\n  Looking at `{ a | ¬¶ }}`, we can say okay, we landed in an interpolation, let's see if the interpolation expression has a child we don't fit in but could if we provided completions for. In this case we would find the child `a |` and could \"pull back\" to it as our context.\r\nBut this quickly falls apart, for example consider  `{{ a | b: 1 + ¬¶  }}`: we would expect our context to be the empty expression on the rhs of `1 +`, but that is a nested child of the `BindingPipe` which we would see as the sole child of the interpolation we landed in.\r\n\r\n- Idea 2: always look for nearest-left-ended node, fallback on narrowest node\r\n  Okay, so maybe we should always just look for nodes that end before the present cursor location. Trying a few examples, this seems to work:\r\n  - `{{ a | b: 1 + ¬¶  }}` finds the empty expression on the RHS of `1 +` as expected\r\n  - `{{ (a | ¬¶ ) + 1 }}` finds the pipe `a |` as expect\r\n  - `{{ ¬¶a = 1 }}` has no nearest node that ended before the cursor, so we fall back on the narrowest node and get a property write, which is OK\r\n  But this idea also quickly falls apart:\r\n  - `{{ a | b: (¬¶) }}` would find the property read `a` as the nearest-left-ended node, but we want to land in the empty expression in `()`\r\n  - `\"a = 1; b = ¬¶2\"` doesn‚Äôt work either, we would find `a = 1` as our context node, but this is clearly incorrect.\r\n\r\n- Idea 3: find node with minimum non-negative `(cur - node.end)` or `(cur - node.start)`\r\n  The idea here is to generalize over what \"being close to a node\" means - it just means we're inside of it, of close to the end of it. So rather than trying to descend onto a node, we can thinking of this as scanning laterally and figuring out which node \"we last saw\" prior to the cursor, and choosing that one.\r\n  - `{{ a | b: 1 + ¬¶  }}` finds the empty expression on the RHS of `1 +` as expected\r\n  - `{{ (a | ¬¶ ) + 1 }}` finds the pipe `a |` as expect\r\n  - `{{ ¬¶a = 1 }}` finds a property write or an interpolation, depending how you treat the cursor position\r\n  - `{{ a | b: (¬¶) }}` finds the empty expression in `()`\r\n  - `\"a = 1; b = ¬¶2\"` finds a property write or an interpolation, depending how you treat the cursor position\r\n  I think this approach works and is intuitive, hence I recommend going this route.\r\n\r\nCurious to hear others' thoughts.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39451","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ivy LS: Context determination (for local completions)\" (#39451)"},{"Id":"730480736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T14:16:11","Actor":"MarcusRiemer","Number":"39450","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n: change default locale from english without generating localized bundles","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n\r\nAngular v10\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSetting the `angular.json` i18n source locale doesn't change the `LOCALE_ID` that is injected to the specified language if compiled with `--localize=false`.

This warning is not displayed when the project is built via Webpack using `AngularCompilerPlugin`.  I asked on https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31730 and it sounds like we need a separate ticket to track this since the linked PR and issue are both auto-closed.

Environment\r\n\r\n`@ngtools-webpack` 10.1.2, but I don't see any relevant changes in the recent 11+ builds.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19226","RelatedDescription":"Open

Maybe in the next lines also, but I did not check it yet.\r\n\r\nI tried to add an element, that perfectly fits, but I could not. I realized that the double of the original margin is used on the right side. I used LTR.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n\r\nTake a document, that has 400px width. The margin is 20px on the viewport of the overlay. I tried to add one overlay at (300, 20) with size of (80,40).

The element should fit without pushing it. The margin should be 20px on the right, too.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nstart.x is 300, the width is 80 as these are given. The viewport width is 360px (=400px-2*20px).\r\n\r\npushX will be -20 as overflowRight is 20. This is calculated by 300+80-360=20.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong. The element can fit without pushing it.

The current APIs are a bit too complex; this can have a negative impact on `TestHarness` adoption.\r\n\r\n# For test authors\r\n\r\n## 1. Easier access to harness\r\n\r\n`HarnessLoader` is a nice abstraction but it can make harness instantiation cumbersome.\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\nlet loader: HarnessLoader;\r\nlet rootLoader: HarnessLoader;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n  loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);\r\n  rootLoader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.documentRootLoader(fixture);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.harnessForFixture(fixture, MyDialogButtonHarness);\r\n\r\n  const buttonHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonHarness);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have faster harness access like:\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 1.A\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.getHarness(MyDialogButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n\r\n  const buttonHarness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.getHarness(MyButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even global functions like `getHarness` and `getProtractorHarness` functions could make the tests even more readable:\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 1.B\r\n```ts\r\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(() => {\r\n  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const dialogButtonHarness = await getHarness(MyDialogButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n  const buttonHarness = await getHarness(MyButtonHarness, {fixture});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# For harness authors\r\n\r\n## 2. `LocatorFactory` abstraction\r\n\r\nThe `LocatorFactory` approach _(e.g. `locatorFor()` method returns a function that takes no parameters)_ can be confusing and cumbersome.\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';\r\n\r\n  protected getTriggerElement = this.locatorFor('button');\r\n\r\n  async toggle() {\r\n    const trigger = await this.getTriggerElement();\r\n    return trigger.click();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 2.A\r\n\r\nSimple accessor methods like `get()` or `getOptional()` seem easier to use and more intuitive.\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';\r\n\r\n  async toggle() {\r\n    const trigger = await this.get('button');\r\n    return trigger.click();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can let developers factorize the way they want:\r\n```ts\r\ngetTriggerElement() {\r\n  return this.get('button');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. `async / await` vs chaining\r\n\r\nI am personally not a big fan of chaining (a.k.a. builder pattern) but in cases like this one where we end up with lots of `await`s, this can simplify the interface:\r\n\r\n### Actual approach\r\n```ts\r\nasync isDisabled() {\r\n  const el = await this.getMessageElement();\r\n  const text = await el.text();\r\n  return text === 'Disabled';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 3.A\r\n```ts\r\nasync isDisabled() {\r\n  return (await this.getMessageElement().text()) === 'Disabled';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Trigger any event\r\n\r\n`TestElement` should have a `triggerEvent` function that allows harness authors to trigger any event. \r\n\r\n### Suggestion 4.A\r\n```ts\r\nel.triggerEvent('dragenter', {})\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Common\r\n\r\n## 5. Provide synchronous functions\r\n\r\nSome environments can query the DOM synchronously (e.g. `TestbedHarnessEnvironment`) or through some under the hood chaining (e.g. Cypress) (Cf. https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress.html#Chains-of-Commands).\r\nHarness authors might want to focus on these environments. In that case, they will want to use synchronous functions and keep tests and harnesses easier to read & write.\r\n\r\n### Current approach\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass ItemListHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'app-item-list';\r\n\r\n  getItems = this.locatorForAll('li');\r\n\r\n  async getItemNames() {\r\n    const items = await this.getItems();\r\n    const itemNames = await Promise.all(items.map(item => item.text()));\r\n    return itemNames;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', async () => {\r\n  const itemListHarness = await loader.getHarness(ItemListHarness);\r\n  expect(await itemListHarness.getItemNames()).toEqual(['üçî', 'üçü']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestion 5.A\r\n\r\nProviding synchronous alternatives to accessors.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass ItemListHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  static hostSelector = 'app-item-list';\r\n\r\n  getItemNamesSync() {\r\n    return this.getAllSync('li').map(item => item.textSync());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nit('loads harnesses', () => {\r\n  const itemListHarness = loader.getHarnessSync(ItemListHarness);\r\n  expect(itemListHarness.getItemNamesSync()).toEqual(['üçî', 'üçü']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 6. `TestbedHarnessEnvironment ` vs. `TestBedHarnessEnvironment `\r\n\r\n`TestbedHarnessEnvironment` could be renamed to `TestBedHarnessEnvironment` to stay consistent with `TestBed` üòâ\r\n\r\n## 7. Merge `TestBed` and `TestbedHarnessEnvironment`\r\n\r\nIn some future, wouldn't it be nice to merge `TestbedHarnessEnvironment` with `TestBed` which means moving test harness to the angular repo?\r\n\r\n## 8. Cypress support\r\n\r\nAn external library could provide a `CypressHarnessEnvironment` but as presented in the 5th item, Cypress is based on an abstract chain of commands. `TestElement` doesn't seem to be the right abstraction for this use case especially for getters like `text()`, `getProperty()` etc...\r\n\r\nThis is the last item on the list but probably the most important one. One of the key features of harnesses is the test environment abstraction and harness reuse through environments (TestBed, Protractor etc...) but if I am using TestBed and Cypress and if I can't reuse my harnesses with Cypress then it somewhat defeats the purpose of harnesses. \r\n\r\n ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(@angular/cdk/testing): Component Harness Feedback\" (#20871)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-10-28T05:30:04.7162958Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2704}

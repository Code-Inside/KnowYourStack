Description\r\n\r\nIn 2017 (#18284), it was chosen to drop the `Intl` API in favor of custom i18N data extracted from the CLDR (`@angular/common/locales/...`. \r\n\r\nSince then the `Intl` API has matured a lot and is now able to cover the feature provided by the framework. \r\n\r\nReplacing the legacy i18n implementation with the `Intl` API is move to shift the localisation responsability from the framework to the platform (browsers, Node or Cloud workers). \r\n\r\n## Deprecations \r\nThis will lead to the deprecation of the following locale getters : \r\n\r\n* `getCurrencySymbol(code: string, format: 'wide' | 'narrow', locale?: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleCurrencyCode(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleCurrencyName(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleCurrencySymbol(locale: string)`\r\n*

`getLocaleFirstDayOfWeek(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleId(locale: string)`\r\n* `getLocaleMonthNames(locale: string, formStyle: FormStyle, width: TranslationWidth)`\r\n*

`getLocaleTimeFormat(locale: string, width: FormatWidth)`\r\n* `getLocaleWeekEndRange(locale: string)`\r\n* `getNumberOfCurrencyDigits(code: string)`\r\n\r\n### Getters with none/partial replacements

function MyDecorator<T extends { new(...args: any[]): {} }>(originalConstructor: T) {\r\n  // Return a new constructor function\r\n  const newConstructor = class extends originalConstructor {\r\n    // You can modify or extend the constructor here\r\n    constructor(...args: any[]) {\r\n      console.log(\"new constructor\");\r\n      super(...args);\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // copying static methods\r\n  Object.entries(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(originalConstructor))\r\n    .filter(([, descriptor]) => descriptor.writable !== false)\r\n    .forEach(([propName]) => {\r\n      const propertyD = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(originalConstructor, propName);\r\n      if (propertyD) {\r\n        Object.defineProperty(\r\n          newConstructor,\r\n          propName,\r\n          propertyD\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  return newConstructor;\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my-lib.service.ts which used @MyDecorator\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MyDecorator } from './my-decorator';\r\n\r\n@MyDecorator\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class MyLibService {\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log(\"old Constructor\")\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getHeros() {\r\n    console.log(\"my lib service get heros\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe result of angular

Webpack is loading the normal sass styles.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be really cool if the webpack condition is matched.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWe could offer a scss variable so that consumers can override the font path or just casually export the file. This still does not solve the problem when using esbuild and the karma runner but at least they could do something.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how much effort it is fixing this, but in case you just need to add `webpack` here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/styles.ts#L382 it would be really cool if you could do it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27100","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"respect wepack export condition for importing\" (#27100)"},{"Id":"2133906230","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-14T15:56:48","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"27098","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support string as plugin option in custom postcss plugin config","State":"closed","Body":"In certain cases, the plugin option may be a string value, as shown in the example below:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n \"plugins\": {\r\n  \"tailwindcss/nesting\": \"postcss-nesting\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#nesting","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27098","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): support string as plugin option in custom postcss plugin config\" (#27098)"},{"Id":"2133617389","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-14T09:32:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27096","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.24.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v3.24.0` -> `v3.24.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.24.1`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.0...v3.24.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.24.0...v3.24.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The recently released `globby@14.0.1` uses the `merge-streams@2.1.0` package which requires a minimum Node.js version higher than the officially supported 18.13 for the Angular CLI. Due to both `globby` and `merge-streams` being transitive dependencies in end-user projects, the Angular CLI cannot directly control the package versions. However, `copy-webpack-plugin@11` uses `globby@13` which is not affected by the Node.js version problem. To workaround the Node.js compatibility problem, `copy-webpack-plugin` has been downgraded to version 11.0.0 which is the latest version in the 11 major for the package. The `copy-webpack-plugin` is only used with the Webpack-based builders when in watch mode. From a review of the commit history between 11.0.0 and 12.0.2 (latest at the time of this commit), it appears the only notable changes are several performance improvements and the major version update of `globby`.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit e75aa9b5818082f2928b777d690027547b62bf9f)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27092","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR

Though I can't find any way to avoid CSS compiler downgrading CSS to equivalent non-nested CSS.\r\n\r\nFor our app, we only support latest browser version, so for us it would be beneficial to use native CSS nesting to make CSS less verbose and builds smaller.\r\n\r\nI tried generating new Angular project with 17.1.3, and setting a `.browserslistrc` (below), but it does not use native CSS nesting.\r\n```\r\nlast 1 Chrome versions\r\nlast 1 Firefox versions\r\nlast 1 Safari major versions\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/8770194/d2b5315f-cb8f-4cbe-9ddf-8ecde4fe4bd3)\r\n\r\nIf native CSS nesting was used, the above should be something like:\r\n```css\r\n[_nghost-ng-c3024018766] {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  background-color: steelblue;\r\n\r\n  h1[_ngcontent-ng-c3024018766] {\r\n    color: white;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think there's two viable solutions for activating native CSS nesting:\r\n\r\n- Via `.browserslists`, to use native CSS nesting when all selected browsers supports it\r\n- By having a flag in the `angular.json` config to disable nesting plugin for `.css`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI don't think there is a workaround, as far as I know. If I want smaller builds and to make use of modern web features, there's no way to do it when using `.css` without removing the current plugin, which is handled automatically by Angular CLI.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27090","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Make native CSS nesting configurable\" (#27090)"},{"Id":"2131538007","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T12:16:21","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27088","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency @typescript-eslint/parser to v7","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) ([source](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/HEAD/packages/parser)) | devDependencies | major | [`6.21.0` -> `7.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@typescript-eslint%2fparser/6.21.0/7.0.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint (@&#8203;typescript-eslint/parser)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.1`](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/HEAD/packages/parser/CHANGELOG.md#701-2024-02-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n### [`v7.0.0`](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/HEAD/packages/parser/CHANGELOG.md#700-2024-02-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/compare/v6.21.0...v7.0.0)\n\n##### 🚀 Features\n\n-   ⚠️  bump ESLint, NodeJS, and TS minimum version requirements\n\n-   add support for flat configs\n\n##### ⚠️  Breaking Changes\n\n-   ⚠️  bump ESLint, NodeJS, and TS minimum version requirements\n\n##### ❤️  Thank You\n\n-   Brad Zacher\n-   Kirk Waiblinger\n-   StyleShit\n-   YeonJuan\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.21.0 (2024-02-05)\n\n##### 🚀 Features\n\n-   allow `parserOptions.project: false`\n\n##### ❤️  Thank You\n\n-   auvred\n-   Brad Zacher\n-   Kirk Waiblinger\n-   Pete Gonzalez\n-   YeonJuan\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.20.0 (2024-01-29)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.19.1 (2024-01-22)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.19.0 (2024-01-15)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.18.1 (2024-01-08)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n#### 6.18.0 (2024-01-06)\n\nThis was a version bump only for parser to align it with other projects, there were no code changes.\n\nYou can read about our [versioning strategy](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/versioning) and [releases](https://main--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/users/releases) on our website.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The recently released `globby@14.0.1` uses the `merge-streams@2.1.0` package which requires a minimum Node.js version higher than the officially supported 18.13 for the Angular CLI. Due to both `globby` and `merge-streams` being transitive dependencies in end-user projects, the Angular CLI cannot directly control the package versions. However, `copy-webpack-plugin@11` uses `globby@13` which is not affected by the Node.js version problem. To workaround the Node.js compatibility problem, `copy-webpack-plugin` has been downgraded to version 11.0.0 which is the latest version in the 11 major for the package. The `copy-webpack-plugin` is only used with the Webpack-based builders when in watch mode. From a review of the commit history between 11.0.0 and 12.0.2 (latest at the time of this commit), it appears the only notable changes are several performance improvements and the major version update of `globby`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27085","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): downgrade copy-webpack-plugin to workaround Node.js support issue\" (#27085)"},{"Id":"2131468039","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T08:06:06","Actor":"JainDhaval","Number":"27086","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular/cli depends on vulnerable version of ip (NPM IP package vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks)","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nnew\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRunning npm audit on Angular v16 project causes an error output, because @angular/cli depends on vulnerable version of npm ip.\r\nSee more details: [GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22)\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate new Angular v16 project.\r\nRun npm audit in the project folder\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 16.2.10\r\nNode: 18.18.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.12\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.12\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.10\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.10\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.10\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@angular/cli depends on vulnerable version of ip (NPM IP package vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks)\" (#27086)"},{"Id":"2131605704","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T07:12:54","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27089","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency webpack-dev-server to v5","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [webpack-dev-server](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) | peerDependencies | major | [`^4.0.0` -> `^5.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/webpack-dev-server/4.15.1/5.0.1) |\n| [webpack-dev-server](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) | dependencies | major | [`4.15.1` -> `5.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/webpack-dev-server/4.15.1/5.0.1) |\n| [webpack-dev-server](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) | devDependencies | major | [`4.15.1` -> `5.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/webpack-dev-server/4.15.1/5.0.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server (webpack-dev-server)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#501-2024-02-13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v5.0.0...v5.0.1)\n\n### [`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#500-2024-02-12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.15.1...v5.0.0)\n\n[Migration Guide and Changes](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/master/migration-v5.md).\n\n##### [4.15.1](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.15.0...v4.15.1) (2023-06-09)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   replace `::` with `localhost` before openBrowser() ([#&#8203;4856](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4856)) ([874c44b](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/874c44b072d55fe42a29d366dbe1c71ca3a94db4))\n-   **types:** compatibility with `@types/ws` ([#&#8203;4899](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4899)) ([34bcec2](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/34bcec242b8bc64c26e9455a8fd5781a59fbcf24))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

border-color set explicitly.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently there are such styles for expansion panel toggle\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n.mat-expansion-indicator::after {\r\n    ...\r\n    color: var(--mat-expansion-header-indicator-color);\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in our case (we use tailwind CSS) we have such global styles (note that it has lower specificity):\r\n```CSS\r\n*, ::before, ::after {\r\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd these styles override the color of the toggle because it's actually a `border`. To fix that I had to apply such global style:\r\n```CSS\r\n.mat-expansion-indicator::after {\r\n    border-color: currentcolor;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Add expansion panel component to the page\r\n2. Set such global styles for the app\r\n```CSS\r\n*, ::before, ::after {\r\n    border-color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. See that expansion panel toggle has become red\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nExpansion panel toggle should have such style included (note `border-color: currentColor`)\r\n```CSS\r\n.mat-expansion-indicator::after {\r\n    ...\r\n    color: var(--mat-expansion-header-indicator-color);\r\n    border-color: currentcolor;\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThere's no styling for the border color.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.1.3\r\nNode: 18.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 3.6.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.1.2\r\n@angular/material               17.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28597","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(expansion panel): toggle does not have a border-color set explicitly.\" (#28597)"},{"Id":"2135368346","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-14T23:46:24","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"28596","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v17.2.0 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"17.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28596","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v17.2.0 release\" (#28596)"},{"Id":"2135367253","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-14T23:27:45","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"28595","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v17.2.0\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28595","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v17.2.0\" with changelog.\" (#28595)"},{"Id":"2133178323","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-14T23:14:58","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28586","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/list): tokenize active-indicator ","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28586","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/list): tokenize active-indicator \" (#28586)"},{"Id":"2134835011","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-14T22:37:01","Actor":"jeffschulzusc","Number":"28591","RawContent":null,"Title":"When cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" under dir=\"rtl\", then CdkDragDrop.previousIndex can be incorrect","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\" under dir=\"rtl\", then CdkDragDrop.previousIndex can be incorrect.\r\n\r\nlike:\r\n``` \r\n<div\r\n    dir=\"rtl\"\r\n    cdkDropList\r\n    #doneList=\"cdkDropList\"\r\n    cdkDropListOrientation=\"horizontal\"\r\n    [cdkDropListData]=\"done\"\r\n    [cdkDropListConnectedTo]=\"[todoList]\"\r\n    class=\"example-list-horiz\"\r\n    (cdkDropListDropped)=\"drop($event)\">\r\n    <div class=\"example-box\" *ngFor=\"let item of done\" cdkDrag>{{item}}</div>\r\n  </div>\r\n```\r\n  \r\nFor example, I can't reorder (horiz list) properly, and can't move (horiz ro vert) list correctly:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/6om1jr-j3qhqe?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-drag-drop-connected-sorting-example.html\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/y3tacw?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-drag-drop-connected-sorting-example.html\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz links: \r\n1.

Specifically, when users attempt to scroll through the options presented in the autocomplete dropdown, the scroll action unexpectedly affects the underlying webpage instead of the dropdown list. This behavior disrupts the user's ability to select an option from the autocomplete list and significantly impacts the usability of the component. The issue has been consistently observed across a variety of devices and web browsers, indicating a broader compatibility or event handling problem within the component.\r\n\r\nVideo Demonstration of the Issue:\r\nhttps://javamaniac.github.io/angular-autocomplete-example/screen-20240212-143204.mp4\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/javamaniac/angular-autocomplete-example\r\n\r\nThe issue with mat-autocomplete scrolling is intermittent and does not have a consistent reproduction sequence. However, it generally involves interactions with the autocomplete component on a mobile device. Below are steps that have sometimes led to the issue, though it may require repeating certain actions or experimenting with the sequence to observe the problem.\r\n\r\nPotential Reproduction Sequences:\r\n\r\nBasic Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nExtended Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Select any option from the list.\r\n3. Clear the selected option (erase the choice).\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options again.\r\n\r\nExternal Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Click outside the dropdown to close it.\r\n3. Re-open the dropdown.\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nNote: The issue may not manifest on the first attempt and could require varying the sequence of actions, such as selecting and clearing choices multiple times or opening and closing the dropdown before scrolling attempts are made. The problem appears to be more likely to occur after interacting with the dropdown in some way (selecting options, erasing choices, or clicking outside the dropdown) before attempting to scroll through the options again.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDragging (scrolling) within the mat-autocomplete dropdown should scroll through the autocomplete options.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAttempting to scroll through the autocomplete options results in the page itself scrolling.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16, 17 (issue likely affects older versions as well)\r\n- CDK/Material: 16, 17\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Edge, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android, iOS\r\n\r\nDevices tested:\r\n- Google Pixel 6 (Chrome, Edge)\r\n- iPhone SE (Chrome, Safari)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28581","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/autocomplete): Intermittent Scrolling Issue with mat-autocomplete on Mobile Devices\" (#28581)"},{"Id":"2130777176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T19:32:53","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28580","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/list): fix m3 demo trailing icon color","State":"closed","Body":"Fix trailing icon color in M3 List demo.

partial declarations","State":"open","Body":"In v14, the partial compilation output of components have changed in a way\r\nthat prevents older versions of Angular to compile the partial declarations\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we used to emit used directives/components in separate arrays called\r\n`components` and `directives`, and used pipes in a property called `pipes`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nTestComponent.ɵcmp = i0.ɵɵngDeclareComponent({\r\n  minVersion: \"12.0.0\",\r\n  version: \"13.3.0\",\r\n  type: TestComponent,\r\n  selector: \"ng-component\",\r\n  ngImport: i0,\r\n  template: ``,\r\n  isInline: true,\r\n  directives: [{ type: i1.SomeDir, selector: \"[some-dir]\" }],\r\n  components: [{ type: i1.SomeCmp, selector: \"some-cmp\" }],\r\n  pipes: { 'async': i2.AsyncPipe },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the `version` property indicates which exact compiler\r\nversion was used to compile the component, but the `minVersion` allows older\r\nversions of the compiler/Angular linker to \"link\" the partial declaration to\r\nits final AOT compilation output.\r\n\r\nIn v14, the used directives, components and pipes are now emitted together\r\ninto a single array under the `dependencies` property:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nTestComponent.ɵcmp = i0.ɵɵngDeclareComponent({\r\n  minVersion: \"12.0.0\",\r\n  version: \"13.3.0\",\r\n  type: TestComponent,\r\n  selector: \"ng-component\",\r\n  ngImport: i0,\r\n  template: ``,\r\n  isInline: true,\r\n  dependencies: [\r\n    { kind: \"directive\", type: i1.SomeDir, selector: \"[some-dir]\" },\r\n    { kind: \"component\", type: i1.SomeCmp, selector: \"some-cmp\" },\r\n    { kind: \"pipe\", type: i2.AsyncPipe },\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change has been made in support of standalone components, but it does mean\r\nthat older compiler versions can no longer link these partial declarations\r\nas desirable as none of the components, directives and pipes would be included\r\nin the AOT-compiled code.\r\n\r\nBy increasing the `minVersion` property, we hint to older compiler versions that\r\nthey are not capable of processing the partial declaration. This allows reporting\r\nan error at compile time instead of resulting in runtime failures due to missing\r\ncomponents, directives and pipes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45782","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): increase minimum version of partial declarations\" (#45782)"},{"Id":"1217727056","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-27T18:23:40","Actor":"atscott","Number":"45780","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v13.3.5\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45780","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v13.3.5\" with changelog.\" (#45780)"},{"Id":"1217693006","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-27T17:48:34","Actor":"AmerAnsari","Number":"45779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Access component variables from SCSS file.","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nLet's explain it with an example:\r\n\r\nI have a variable that holds color and I want to use them for styling the elements. \r\nI know we can change the styles via renderer or something like that.\r\nAnd I can't do that in the template with `ngStyle` or etc because I want to use that color in SCSS mixin functions.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nNone.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45779","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Access component variables from SCSS file.\" (#45779)"},{"Id":"1215086062","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-27T16:07:42","Actor":"sumitarora","Number":"45762","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(devtools): fixing initial loading animation","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Another component is dynamically created, and inserted into the ViewContainerRef of one of these ng-containers. This dynamic component is moved between the containers via a button click, which just does detach() on the current ViewContainerRef, and insert() on the new ViewContainerRef.\r\n\r\nThe component being moved contains a subject with a number. In the template, a structural directive is used to show a different text for each number (the bug appears with ngIf as well as ngSwitch, the reproduction uses ngIf). The texts have an enter/leave animation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-wm7e9e?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcomponent-to-move%2Fcomponent-to-move.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 13.3.3\r\nNode: 16.13.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.3.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1303.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.3\r\n@angular/cli                    13.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular             13.3.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.6.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nThere is another issue relating to animations and ViewContainerRefs (https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35959), but in that one only the animations are broken.

Upon upgrading to Angular 13, we found out that deployUrl had been deprecated in favor of baseHref and / or APP_BASE_HREF. So part of our migration consisted in removing deployUrl in our Web Components SPA that is used by our affiliates to embed our Web Components into their web sites. We already had baseHref (in project.json) and APP_BASE_HREF (in AppModule) \r\n\r\nproject.json\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\"configurations\": {\r\n  \"production\": {\r\n    \"baseHref\": \"https://elements.iko.travel/\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\napp.module.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nproviders: [\r\n   {\r\n      provide: APP_BASE_HREF,\r\n      useValue: environment.baseHref,\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nenvironment.prod.ts \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  baseHref: 'https://elements.iko.travel/',\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ndefined alongside deployUrl so migration involved only removing deployUrl from ./apps/web-components/project.json (We use Nx).\r\n\r\nImmediately after a release to production, we were notified that our Web Components were no longer loading properly. We looked at one of the sites and could see it was trying to load our modules locally to the affiliate site.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: \r\nA page is hosted here: https://life.rocks/and/then/some. It contains one of our Web Components. Our WC would try to load assets from that same URL like so: \r\n`https://life.rocks/and/then/some/897.js`\r\n\r\nOnce we reverted back to deployUrl, everything worked as it should again. baseHref and APP_BASE_HREF had no effect on where libraries were loaded from.\r\n\r\nPlease make very sure before removing deployUrl that it does not cause this type of error to occur.\r\n\r\nWe could easily spin up this error in staging upon request but it would maybe be worth a quick look in your codebase to verify this behavior.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnx report\r\n\r\n >  NX   Report complete - copy this into the issue template\r\n\r\n   Node : 16.14.2\r\n   OS   : darwin arm64\r\n   yarn : 1.22.18\r\n\r\n   Angular / CLI: 13.3.3\r\n   nx : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/angular : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/cypress : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/detox : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/devkit : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/eslint-plugin-nx : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/express : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/jest : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/js : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/linter : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/nest : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/next : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/node : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/nx-cloud : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/nx-plugin : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/react : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/react-native : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/schematics : Not Found\r\n   @nrwl/storybook : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/web : 13.10.3\r\n   @nrwl/workspace : 13.10.3\r\n   typescript : 4.6.3\r\n   rxjs : 7.5.5\r\n   ---------------------------------------\r\n   Community plugins:\r\n   \t @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome: 0.10.2\r\n   \t @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap: 12.0.2\r\n   \t @ngneat/transloco: 4.0.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/component: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/component-store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/data: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/effects: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/entity: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/router-store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/store: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/store-devtools: 13.1.0\r\n   \t angular-calendar: 0.29.0\r\n   \t @compodoc/compodoc: 1.1.19\r\n   \t @jscutlery/semver: 2.22.0\r\n   \t @ngrx/schematics: 13.1.0\r\n   \t @storybook/angular: 6.4.22\r\n```\r\n\r\n🍺\r\nBjorn\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23033","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Do not deprecate deployUrl.

For example, the two events on `CdkDropList` that tell you the current container to which a dragged item will snap to are `cdkDropListEntered` and `cdkDropListExited`. \r\n\r\nHowever, because of the snapping functionality built into the module from the start, the `cdkDropListExited` event only fires when the item changes its linked container, not when the container HTMLElement is no longer hovered over (what we would expect from `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` from the native browser API).\r\n\r\nWhile this makes the implementation and management of snapping containers much easier, it only complicates the implementation of non-snapping logic. Mostly because there is no *easy* way to know when a `cdkDropList` is no longer hovered.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to either (or both)\r\n\r\n**a)** Introduce two new events in `cdkDropList` that would mirror the native `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` events and would be triggered when a dragged item enter/leave the area occupied by the container's HTML element (the event mimicking `dragEnter` would not constitute a duplicate of the already existing `cdkDropListEntered` one because it is possible to drag the mouse cursor in and out of the container area multiple times while keeping the dragged item bound to it if no other container was hovered over during the operation).\r\n\r\n**b)** Introduce a new type named `cdkHoverTarget` for example, which would act as a non-snapping hover target (and possibly not a container). It would expose the two events reflecting `dragEnter` and `dragLeave` and would be used to know when the user has its mouse cursor over a specific element during a drag operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nOne use of such a feature that I can think of would be in implementing a file manager: when dragging a file over a folder to move it into that folder, one would not expect the file preview to keep saying \"move to <folder>\" when the folder is no longer hovered over. This use case requires the developer to be able to know when a possible drop target is no longer hovered over, which is not trivial to achieve using the currently exposed events of the drag-drop module.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24814","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(drag-drop): Make it easier to know when a CdkDropList is [no longer] hovered\" (#24814)"},{"Id":"1210648738","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-21T07:59:43","Actor":"diprokon","Number":"24813","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input","State":"open","Body":"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input\r\n\r\nShows valid formatted value for 'falsy' values (exp 0)\r\nCustom DateAdapter (exp TimestampDateAdapter) can have valid numeric 0 value (for timestamp it is 1/1/1970), but datepicker input doesn't show formatted value","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24813","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/datepicker): add ability to have numeric zero value in input\" (#24813)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-04-28T03:30:03.1473867Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2153}

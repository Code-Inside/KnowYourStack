Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nUpdate an existing 10.0.1 application to 10.0.2\r\nStart with ng serve\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, subsequent ng serve commands do not do the first es2015 pass, and I don't know how to force it to.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here:

I'm honestly not sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nEssentially, I would like to have the ability to take a `TemplateRef` and inject _copies_ of it into multiple template outlets. The use case that made me aware of this limitation was trying to create a `<select>`-style form control, where consumers could put any arbitrary content into an option (not just text, but icons, images, components, etc.). When an option is selected, the Select component would _re_-project that option's content into the Select's template to indicate the currently selected option.\r\n\r\nIn case that's not clear, here's a simplified/truncated version of the solution that I attempted.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-select',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div class=\"selected-value\">\r\n      <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"selectedTemplate\"></ng-container>\r\n      <ng-container *ngIf=\"!selectedTemplate\">{{ placeholder }}</ng-container>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"options\">\r\n      <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n    </div>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class SelectComponent implements AfterContentInit {\r\n\r\n  @Input() placeholder = \"Select an option\";\r\n  @ContentChildren(OptionComponent) options: QueryList<OptionComponent>;\r\n  selectedTemplate: TemplateRef<null>;\r\n\r\n  ngAfterContentInit() {\r\n    this.options.forEach(option => {\r\n      option.selected.subscribe(() => {\r\n        this.selectedTemplate = option.contentTemplate;\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-option',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"contentTemplate\"></ng-container>\r\n    <ng-template #contentTemplate>\r\n      <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n    </ng-template>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class OptionComponent {\r\n\r\n  @Output() selected = new EventEmitter<void>();\r\n  @ViewChild('contentTemplate') contentTemplate: TemplateRef<null>;\r\n\r\n  @HostListener('click') onClick() {\r\n    this.selected.emit();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's an example usage that takes advantage of the template cloning:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<label for=\"status\">Task Status</label>\r\n<my-select id=\"status\" [(ngModel)]=\"statusValue\">\r\n  <my-option [value]=\"Status.Blocked\">\r\n    <my-icon icon=\"ban\"></my-icon> Blocked\r\n  </my-option>\r\n  <my-option [value]=\"Status.Researching\">\r\n    <my-icon icon=\"science\"></my-icon> Researching\r\n  </my-option>\r\n  <my-option [value]=\"Status.InProgress\">\r\n    <my-icon icon=\"ellipsis\"></my-icon> In Progress\r\n  <my-option>\r\n  <my-option [value]=\"Status.Done\">\r\n    <my-icon icon=\"check\"></my-icon> Done\r\n  </my-option>\r\n</my-select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works as intended, except it appears that the `TemplateRef` can only be embedded into one view container at any given time. So, when an option is selected, it appears in the SelectComponent's template outlet (üéâ), but _disappears_ from the OptionComponent's template outlet (üò≠), leaving a blank spot in the options list.\r\n\r\n![TemplateRef copy attempt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13191586/87069082-984b5700-c1e4-11ea-8984-fa8d804fa7d7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be great if the sample code above just worked as expected out of the box, but I can understand if that's not feasible, or if it's undesirable for some reason I'm not aware of.\r\n\r\nI dug through some of CDK's source code, because I knew that its Drag-and-Drop feature was doing some sort of element cloning for the preview and placeholder elements, so I hoped that maybe they were making use of some Angular template/view APIs that I was unfamiliar with. Unfortunately, it looks like that feature is just using some [raw, low-level DOM manipulation](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/fb769ef421f5b73a5d88163864e89e1b834086ec/src/cdk/drag-drop/drag-ref.ts#L1316) to achieve this, which would be way overkill for my use case.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it would be possible to add a `clone` method to the `TemplateRef` class, which would return a new `TemplateRef` that could be embedded into an additional template outlet without detaching the original?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nIf I specifically wanted to enable icons in my OptionComponent, of course I could add an `@Input() icon: IconName`, and replicate that to my SelectComponent. I could make the OptionComponent's label a simple `@Input label: string` while I'm at it, instead of fiddling with the content projection at all. But I like to keep these types of core UI components as flexible as possible for a wide variety of use cases, so that when a new use case comes up that I hadn't originally anticipated, it can be accommodated without needing to make major updates to the component or [endlessly tack on configuration options](https://youtu.be/0BikjL858OQ?t=324). If there's another alternative or workaround that I haven't thought of, I would love to hear it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37995","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[feature] Ability to clone a TemplateRef to multiple outlets at once\" (#37995)"},{"Id":"654195528","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T17:11:20","Actor":"atscott","Number":"37993","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: fix payload size","State":"closed","Body":"Payload size test is failing on the 10.0.x branch at the moment.\r\n\r\nhttps://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/angular/angular/18305/workflows/ac9b3755-03dc-46ea-94dd-fe1deb576721/jobs/760453/steps","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37993","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: fix payload size\" (#37993)"},{"Id":"654209809","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T16:55:15","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"37994","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: add more owners for some categories","State":"open","Body":"* Add petebacondarwin to public-api, size-tracking, and\r\n-circular-dependencies\r\n* Add josephperrott and jelbourn to code-ownership","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37994","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: add more owners for some categories\" (#37994)"},{"Id":"654179179","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T16:06:10","Actor":"IgorMinar","Number":"37992","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update closure integration tests + add closure compatible build","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37992","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update closure integration tests + add closure compatible build\" (#37992)"},{"Id":"653435925","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T15:36:58","Actor":"antch","Number":"37981","RawContent":null,"Title":"ChangeDetectorRef `markForCheck` doesn't behave properly in Angular Elements","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/elements\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nInvoking `changeDetectorRef.markForCheck()` doesn't work properly inside of an Angular Element in some cases.\r\nThis issue surfaced when I tried to use [ng-select](https://github.com/ng-select/ng-select) within a Custom Element and noticed that external binding changes were not being propagated.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Http Client provides the return types: string, ArrayBuffer, Blob and JSON objects typed with interfaces.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider that we have an API endpoint that delivers the following JSON response and a class to manage this information:\r\n\r\n```\r\n {\r\n    \"firstName\": \"John\",\r\n    \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\r\n    \"dateOfBirth\": \"2000-01-01\"\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n class Person {\r\n    firstName: string;\r\n    lastName: string;\r\n    dateOfBirth: Date;\r\n\r\n    getFullName(): string {\r\n        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to get a typed response, we can create the following interface and use a map to parse the response:\r\n\r\n```\r\n interface PersonJson {\r\n \tfirstName: string;\r\n\tlastName: string;\r\n\tdateOfBirth: string;\r\n }\r\n\r\n function getPerson(): Observable<Person> {\r\n    this.httpClient.get<PersonJson>('/person').pipe(map(personJson => {\r\n        const person = new Person();\r\n        person.firstName = personJson.firstName;\r\n        person.lastName = personJson.lastName;\r\n        person.dateOfBirth = new Date(personJson.dateOfBirth + ' 00:00:00');\r\n    }));\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nFirst, I would like to propose the standard of implementing the methods toJSON (standard JavaScript function) and fromJSON (static) in the Person class:\r\n\r\n```\r\n class Person {\r\n    firstName: string;\r\n    lastName: string;\r\n    dateOfBirth: Date;\r\n\r\n    static fromJSON(obj: any): Person {\r\n         const person = new Person();\r\n         person.firstName = obj.firstName;\r\n         person.lastName = obj.lastName;\r\n         person.dateOfBirth = new Date(obj.dateOfBirth + ' 00:00:00');\r\n         return person;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    toJSON(): object {\r\n        return {\r\n            ...this,\r\n            dateOfBirth: this.dateOfBirth.getFullYear().toString() + '-' +\r\n                (this.dateOfBirth.getMonth() + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0') + '-' +\r\n                this.dateOfBirth.getDate().toString().padStart(2, '0')\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    getFullName(): string {\r\n        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, with no modifications in the Http Client, the last code can be shortened to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n getPerson(): Observable<Person> {\r\n    return this.httpClient.get('/person').pipe(map(Person.fromJSON));\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it could be even shorter/better if we adapt the Http Client to recognize this standard and accept as a parameter a class that implements the static method fromJSON. By doing this, the Http Client can use the fromJSON method to return parsed class objects instead of plain JSON objects. The proposed implementation results in the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n getPerson(): Observable<Person> {\r\n    return this.httpClient.get('/person', Person);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nComplementary, it is important to remark that the standard toJSON method is automatically used by the Http Client to parse Person objects to JSON objects when sending it in the body of PATCH/POST/PUT requests.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nSupport for array of objects is also added. Consider that in the above example the endpoint returns an array of Persons. In this case, it is only necessary to change the generic type of the get function to Person[]:\r\n\r\n```\r\n function getPerson(): Observable<Person> {\r\n    return this.httpClient.get<Person[]>('/person', Person);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a second commit was included to fix some typos and missing punctuation.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37987","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Adapt the Http Client to return class objects\" (#37987)"},{"Id":"653727272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T03:09:06","Actor":"ivanwonder","Number":"37983","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): remove completion for string","State":"open","Body":"If the user inputs a string(e.g. `<div [ngClass]=\"'str~{cursor}'\"></div>`), the completion is useless.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This currently results in a noop migration as file\r\nsystem paths were computed incorrectly. This is because ng-update\r\nalways assumed that the CWD is the workspace root in the real file\r\nsystem. This is not the case and therefore threw off path resolution.\r\n\r\nWe fix this by fully relying on the virtual file system now. Previously\r\nwe mixed virtual and real file system as TypeScript relied on the\r\nreal file system for parsing configuration, matching and reading files.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a new compiler host for config parsing and program\r\ncreation that works fully with a virtual file system. This is something\r\nwe had planned a long time ago as schematics should never deal with\r\nthe real file system. We can re-use this logic in other repositories\r\ntoo (such as Angular framework, potentially the CLI, and universal\r\nschematics).

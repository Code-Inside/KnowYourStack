Description\r\n\r\nHere is a component:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"d.toggle()\">Toggle</button>\r\n    <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"state = !state\">Toggle by binding</button>\r\n    <ul class=\"mt-2\">\r\n      <li>state = {{ state

[(myDirective)]=\"state\"></div>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  state = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt uses the following directive:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Directive, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\nexport const createModel = () => {\r\n  const state$ = new BehaviorSubject(true);\r\n  const processing$ = new BehaviorSubject(false);\r\n  const toggle = async (newState = !state$.getValue()): Promise<void> => {\r\n    console.log('Beginning toggle, newState = ' + newState);\r\n    // Note that uncommenting the following line is a workaround for this issue:\r\n    // await Promise.resolve();\r\n    processing$.next(true);\r\n    state$.next(newState);\r\n    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\r\n    processing$.next(false);\r\n    console.log('Ending toggle, newState = ' + newState);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    state$,\r\n    processing$,\r\n    toggle,\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[myDirective]',\r\n  exportAs: 'myDirective',\r\n})\r\nexport class MyDirective {\r\n  private model = createModel();\r\n\r\n  @Input('myDirective')\r\n  set state(value: boolean) {\r\n    this.model.toggle(value);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Output('myDirectiveChange')\r\n  stateChange = this.model.state$;\r\n\r\n  processing = this.model.processing$;\r\n\r\n  toggle() {\r\n    return this.model.toggle();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the \"Toggle\" button in the component, everything works as expected:\r\n- The first two lines `state` and `d.state` have the same boolean value (the opposite of the previous value), and the third line has `processing = true`\r\n- After 1s, the third line switches back to `processing = false`\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the \"Toggle by binding\" button, the same `toggle` method from the model is triggered, so the same behavior as before would be expected. However, Angular only refreshes the first line (`state`) and does not update the `d.state` and `processing` lines, even though they changed. After 1s, the second line (`d.state`) is updated with the correct value and the third line did not change at all (now that the value of `processing` is back to `false`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-liytcm?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nThere is no error in the console.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.7\r\nNode: 16.17.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.15.0 \r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                    14.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular             14.0.7\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47594","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Refresh not done properly when triggered by a binding in a directive\" (#47594)"},{"Id":"1393111938","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-30T23:17:48","Actor":"josmar-crwdstffng","Number":"47596","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update doc contribution","State":"open","Body":"Peer review for #47381 that depends on [bob-watson:update-doc-contribution](https://github.com/bob-watson/angular/tree/update-doc-contribution).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47596","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update doc contribution\" (#47596)"},{"Id":"1392915580","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-30T19:43:06","Actor":"markostanimirovic","Number":"47595","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add Marko to GDE resources","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Firefox does not yet support manifest v3 in it's latest stable release. When Firefox makes this transition, a follow up PR will update the Firefox manifest file to version 3.\r\n\r\nBecause Firefox still needs v2, we need to keep some old v2 APIs around in our background page (service worker in v3) that will execute conditionally based on if the extension was built for v2 or v3. This is determined with the `chrome.runtime.getManifest().manifest_version` API.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n> `ng_validate.ts` content script was refactored into `ng_validate.ts` and `detect-angular-for-extension-icon.ts`. Previously this script would execute code on the main page that would detect the existence of Angular and communicate it to the DevTools background page in order to update the Angular icon and popup in the toolbar.\r\n>\r\n> This code would execute on the main page through a script tag that we supply a function to like so, `script.textContent = functionAsString`. \r\n>\r\n> With v3, this method of executing code in a content script [no longer works](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-migration/#code-execution), so we follow the [migration guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv3-migration-checklist/#api-remote-code) to resolve this. \r\n>\r\n> The only notable change here is that our detection code no longer executes synchronously with `ng_validate.ts`. This is not an issue as this content script was always loaded asynchronously in the first place, and we have no such feature in Angular DevTools that requires it to execute synchronously.\r\n\r\n> The `chrome.tabs.executeScript` API no longer works in v3. As [per the guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv3-migration-checklist/#api-tabs), we switch to using `chrome.scripting.executeScript`.\r\n\r\n\r\n> The `chrome.browserAction` API was previously used to set the icon and popup in the browser toolbar. In v3, this API along with the `chrome.pageAction` API was merged into the `chrome.action` API. As [per the guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv3-migration-checklist/#api-browser-action-js), we make this change.\r\n\r\n>[This guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-migration/#updating-manifest-dot-json) to migrating the manifest.json file was followed.\r\n\r\ncloses #46287","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47575","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(devtools): migrate to manifest v3\" (#47575)"},{"Id":"1389961426","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T21:23:36","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"47574","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v15.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47574","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v15.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#47574)"},{"Id":"1389957103","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T21:18:22","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"47573","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v14.2.4 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"14.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47573","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v14.2.4 release\" (#47573)"},{"Id":"1389954272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-28T21:16:26","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"47572","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v14.2.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47572","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v14.2.4\" with changelog.\" (#47572)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1393545856","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-01T20:41:55","Actor":"DariuszOstolski","Number":"23994","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): Added --directory option to the library scâ€¦","State":"open","Body":"â€¦hematics\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Previously the `*` was required to be at the end of the pattern. It lets you do something like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"exports\": {\n        \"./features/*\": \"./features/*.js\",\n        \"./features/*.js\": \"./features/*.js\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, esbuild now supports these types of patterns too.\n\n-   Fix subpath imports with Yarn PnP ([#&#8203;2545](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2545))\n\n    Node has a little-used feature called [subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) which are package-internal imports that start with `#` and that go through the `imports` map in `package.json`. Previously esbuild had a bug that caused esbuild to not handle these correctly in packages installed via Yarn's \"Plug'n'Play\" installation strategy. The problem was that subpath imports were being checked after Yarn PnP instead of before. This release reorders these checks, which should allow subpath imports to work in this case.\n\n-   Link from JS to CSS in the metafile ([#&#8203;1861](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1861), [#&#8203;2565](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2565))\n\n    When you import CSS into a bundled JS file, esbuild creates a parallel CSS bundle next to your JS bundle. So if `app.ts` imports some CSS files and you bundle it, esbuild will give you `app.js` and `app.css`. You would then add both `<script src=\"app.js\"></script>` and `<link href=\"app.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">` to your HTML to include everything in the page. This approach is more efficient than having esbuild insert additional JavaScript into `app.js` that downloads and includes `app.css` because it means the browser can download and parse both the CSS and the JS in parallel (and potentially apply the CSS before the JS has even finished downloading).\n\n    However, sometimes it's difficult to generate the `<link>` tag. One case is when you've added `[hash]` to the [entry names](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#entry-names) setting to include a content hash in the file name. Then the file name will look something like `app-GX7G2SBE.css` and may change across subsequent builds. You can tell esbuild to generate build metadata using the `metafile` API option but the metadata only tells you which generated JS bundle corresponds to a JS entry point (via the `entryPoint` property), not which file corresponds to the associated CSS bundle. Working around this was hacky and involved string manipulation.\n\n    This release adds the `cssBundle` property to the metafile to make this easier. It's present on the metadata for the generated JS bundle and points to the associated CSS bundle. So to generate the HTML tags for a given JS entry point, you first find the output file with the `entryPoint` you are looking for (and put that in a `<script>` tag), then check for the `cssBundle` property to find the associated CSS bundle (and put that in a `<link>` tag).\n\n    One thing to note is that there is deliberately no `jsBundle` property mapping the other way because it's not a 1:1 relationship. Two JS bundles can share the same CSS bundle in the case where the associated CSS bundles have the same name and content. In that case there would be no one value for a hypothetical `jsBundle` property to have.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.5`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0265-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0264v0265-2022-09-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.26.4...v0.26.5)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   update typescript definition file to contain `replaceAll()` ([#&#8203;224](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/224)) ([45a4921](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/45a49214ba244b906f4d20450debc8edcc06e2a8))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.17`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8417)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.16...8.4.17)\n\n-   Fixed `Node.before()` unexpected behavior (by Romain Menke).\n-   Added TOC to docs (by Mikhail Dedov).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I'm working on a project where feature is usually split into multiple directories, for example:\r\n\r\nprojects/libs/feature-name/\r\n- app\r\n- shared\r\n- model\r\n- store\r\n\r\nAfter migration when I try to create a library with a such scheme it is no longer possible, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n$ npx ng generate library projects/libs/feature/model                                                                                                                                                                                           â€¹ruby-2.6.6â€º\r\nSchematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"projects/libs/feature/model\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path \"/name\" must match pattern \"^(?:@[a-zA-Z0-9-*~][a-zA-Z0-9-*._~]*/)?[a-zA-Z0-9-~][a-zA-Z0-9-._~]*$\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that there is a workaround that when we make a path alias to projects/libs/feature-name it will work, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npx ng generate library @feature-alias/model                                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this project its very inconvenient since we have 100 different features and we would need to alias almost each one of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```bash\r\n# create empty workspace\r\n ng new my-workspace --create-application false\r\n# in that workspace create a library with nested directories\r\ncd my-workspace/my-project\r\nnpx ng generate library projects/libs/feature/model\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nSchematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"projects/libs/feature/model\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path

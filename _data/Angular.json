(ExE-Boss)\n\nOther changes:\n\n-   Added support for `<input type=image>` submitting forms. (jenseng)\n-   Added the `location` setter to the `Window` object, which forwards to the `location.href` setter. Setting the URL is still only implemented for fragment navigations, however. (ExE-Boss)\n-   Fixed `defer=\"\"` `<script>` elements that are added after `DOMContentLoaded` to execute, instead of being skipped.\n-   Fixed `selectElement.selectedOptions` being incorrect when `optionElement.selected` is set. This was a regression introduced in v20.0.1. Unfortunately this also reverts the performance improvement when appending `<option>` elements that was introduced then. (eps1lon)\n-   Fixed the `self`, `locationbar`, `menubar`, `personalbar`, `scrollbars`, `statusbar`, `toolbar`, `frames`, `parent`, `external`, `length`, and `screen` properties of `Window` to be replaceable: that is, setting them will override their values, instead of having the new value be ignored. (ExE-Boss)\n-   Fixed a few issues with `JSOM.fromURL()` in the browser build of jsdom.

This PR is the beginning of our approach to make debugging dependency injection in Angular easier.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis commit introduces injector profiler callbacks in parts of the framework to emit injector events. It also introduces a default handler for these events. This default handler parses the stream of events to construct some data structures that will support new injector debug APIs. This commit introduces one of these new APIs `getInjectedServices`, which will be used by DevTools to implement some DI inspecting features. See comments in `injector-profiler.ts` for more implementation details.\r\n\r\n## Why was this implemented with a profiler?\r\n- DI maps nicely to a stream of events.\r\n- There is the possibility of making the internal `setInjectorProfiler` function a public debug API in the future, so that users can implement their own handlers to debug DI events.\r\n\r\n## Will this affect runtime performance?\r\nFor production builds no. For dev builds there is some additional overhead from the default profiler handling injector events and holding debug data in memory. Logic in these handlers is minimal, WeakMaps are used for keeping track of data and constant time lookups. No loops are performed in these handlers.\r\n\r\n## Will this affect bundle size?\r\nNo. Dead code elimination should strip all the code used by this commit.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48639","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(devtools): create profiler for injector events in dev mode\" (#48639)"},{"Id":"1518457741","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-04T08:08:51","Actor":"jellyzhai","Number":"48637","RawContent":null,"Title":"The function parameter index and item in the 'TrackByFunction' interface be swapped. `index` is optional","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncommon\n\n### Description\n\n```\r\ninterface TrackByFunction<T> {\r\n  <U extends T>(index: number, item: T & U): any\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn practical applications, the 'index' parameter is not commonly used, but also occupies the first parameter position, resulting in forced writing. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt is recommended that the 'index' and 'item' parameters be interchanged and changed to optional parameters\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48637","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"The function parameter index and item in the 'TrackByFunction' interface be swapped. `index` is optional\" (#48637)"},{"Id":"1517834682","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-03T19:39:24","Actor":"irustm","Number":"48635","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: do not use shared module","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Also the version should correspond to the version we install for building & testing.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Babel version allowed by the compiler-cli may not work given the ESM -> CJS interop. causing errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { types as t } from \"@babel/core\";\r\n         ^^^^^\r\nSyntaxError: Named export 'types' not found. The requested module '@babel/core' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.\r\nCommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:\r\n\r\nimport pkg from '@babel/core';\r\nconst { types: t } = pkg;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can only be confident about the interop if we know the version installed- is the one we test. The error above\r\ndoes not surface in integration tests because the Angular CLI brings a more recent Babel version. In components\r\nthis failed because we had an older version of Babel that breaks the NodeJS CJS/ESM interop.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\n* It previously worked because we had a \"hacky\" file to make the `@babel/core` import work (back when the repo also executed the linker code as CommonJS).

When present, the value will either be `cjs` for CommonJS-style exports or `esm` for ESM-style exports. This can be useful in bundle analysis.\n\n    For example, esbuild's new [Bundle Size Analyzer](https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/) now uses this information to visualize whether ESM or CommonJS was used for each directory and file of source code (click on the CJS/ESM bar at the top).\n\n    This information is helpful when trying to reduce the size of your bundle. Using the ESM variant of a dependency instead of the CommonJS variant always results in a faster and smaller bundle because it omits CommonJS wrappers, and also may result in better tree-shaking as it allows esbuild to perform tree-shaking at the statement level instead of the module level.\n\n-   Fix a bundling edge case with dynamic import ([#&#8203;2793](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2793))\n\n    This release fixes a bug where esbuild's bundler could produce incorrect output. The problematic edge case involves the entry point importing itself using a dynamic `import()` expression in an imported file, like this:\n\n    ```js\n    // src/a.js\n    export const A = 42;\n\n    // src/b.js\n    export const B = async () => (await import(\".\")).A\n\n    // src/index.js\n    export * from \"./a\"\n    export * from \"./b\"\n    ```\n\n-   Remove new type syntax from type declarations in the `esbuild` package ([#&#8203;2798](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2798))\n\n    Previously you needed to use TypeScript 4.3 or newer when using the `esbuild` package from TypeScript code due to the use of a getter in an interface in `node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.d.ts`. This release removes this newer syntax to allow people with versions of TypeScript as far back as TypeScript 3.5 to use this latest version of the `esbuild` package. Here is change that was made to esbuild's type declarations:\n\n    ```diff\n     export interface OutputFile {\n       /** \"text\" as bytes */\n       contents: Uint8Array;\n       /** \"contents\" as text (changes automatically with \"contents\") */\n    -  get text(): string;\n    +  readonly text: string;\n     }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.4.21`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;8421)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.4.20...8.4.21)\n\n-   Fixed `Input#error` types (by Aleks Hudochenkov).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>verdaccio/verdaccio</summary>\n\n### [`v5.19.1`](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.19.0...v5.19.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/compare/v5.19.0...v5.19.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Ts, HTML, CSS/SCSS, and.spec.ts files must therefore be manually renamed and changed.\r\n\r\nI frequently use the Angular CLI, and I believe that having this option would be useful since sometimes we merely construct angular components and then need to rename them. The produced angular component, directive, etc. must be deleted and the procedure to create the component must be executed again because there is no rename command.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nHere is some additional commentary. It has the advantage of adhering to the newly developed style guide when CLI builds new components and other components. Maybe the style guide truly needs to hear this comment. That much duplication and naming is unquestionably produced. We receive N copies of each item's name across various folders and files when we add something using this tools, and we also receive N copies of each item's name in two separate ways. This causes a lot of friction when it's time to rename, which happens frequently in actual applications. There doesn't seem to be anything that can be done about it as it has already been decided that each name will be used twice as an official style (or more).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nIn VSCode, for instance, you can see error messages in the files explorer pane on the left when something is wrong (imported file that isn't there, non-existent component, etc.). Therefore, when I wanted to rename a component, I simply changed the names of its folder and internal files.

Prior to this, the release builds were performed using a custom build script that programmatically invoked TypeScript APIs. The Bazel build and discovery process for the releasable packages is performed by a script that is based on the scripts from components and framework repositories. Several small modifications were performed to match the behavior and structure of the cli repository:\r\n* Use of `packages` as the source root in the bazel query\r\n* Use of `pkg_npm` rule in the bazel query\r\n* Partial transition to native Node.js `fs` APIs instead of `shelljs`\r\n* Directory creation per package when copying output (supports multiple package scopes)\r\n* Copying of archives (tgz) for each package\r\n\r\nThe snapshot and local build capabilities are not modified as part of this change but will be merged in a followup as part of a larger transition to use bazel throughout the package build process.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24483","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: use bazel to perform release builds\" (#24483)"},{"Id":"1518375548","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-04T16:06:12","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24485","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency typescript to v4.9.4","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`4.9.3` -> `4.9.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/4.9.3/4.9.4) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>Microsoft/TypeScript</summary>\n\n### [`v4.9.4`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/releases/tag/v4.9.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/compare/v4.9.3...v4.9.4)\n\nFor release notes, check out the [release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9).\n\nFor the complete list of fixed issues, check out the\n\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript v4.9.4](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+4.9.4%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n\nDownloads are available on:\n\n-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)\n-   [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild)\n\n##### Changes:\n\n-   [`e286821`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/e2868216f637e875a74c675845625eb15dcfe9a2) Bump version to 4.9.4 and LKG.\n-   [`eb5419f`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/eb5419fc8d980859b98553586dfb5f40d811a745) Cherry-pick [#&#8203;51704](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51704) to release 4.9 ([#&#8203;51712](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51712))\n-   [`b4d382b`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/b4d382b9b12460adf2da4cc0d1429cf19f8dc8be) Cherry-pick changes for narrowing to tagged literal types.\n-   [`e7a02f4`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/e7a02f43fce47e1a39259ada5460bcc33c8e98b5) Port of [#&#8203;51626](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51626) and [#&#8203;51689](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51689) to release-4.9 ([#&#8203;51627](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51627))\n-   [`1727912`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/1727912f0437a7f367d90040fc4b0b4f3efd017a) Cherry-pick fix around `visitEachChild` to release-4.9.

I couldn't find one.\r\n\r\nSometimes you have a component that gets several `@Input()`s but if one of them isn't passed to the component when it's called you would prefer if this code **won't even compile**. \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n\r\nexport class VehicleCardComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\r\n\r\n  @Input() crewId: string;\r\n  @Input() somData: string;\r\n  \r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n  ngOnDestroy(): void {\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n}\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  Currently if the component doesn't get the `crewId` input nothing happens.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<app-vehicle-card\r\n  [somData]=\"'Hello'\"\r\n>\r\n</app-vehicle-card>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  I thought about this after using other frameworks, e.g. **React**:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n```tsx\r\ninterface CardProps {\r\n  title: string,\r\n  paragraph: string\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const Card = ({ title, paragraph }: CardProps) => {\r\n\r\nreturn (\r\n  <aside>\r\n    <h2>{ title }</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n      { paragraph }\r\n    </p>\r\n  </aside>\r\n)};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I call the `Card` component without providing `title` and `paragraph` my code won't compile.\r\n\r\n### A small note\r\nThis is not the purpose of this issue but:\r\n\r\nWhen declaring members in `strict-mode` you many times get this error when you don't assign an initial value:\r\n_**Property 'something' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.**_\r\n\r\nPerhaps using a required `@Input()` could make the compiler ignore this specific line cause I would know for certain that this input will be initialized. \r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am not an Angular/JS/TS expert. \r\nThere are a few possible solutions for this, I believe the most comfortable one would be to use something like \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n@RequiredInput() val: string;\r\n\r\n// or\r\n@MandatoryInput() val: boolean;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhenever we need one.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThere are other solutions that I found in Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35528395/make-directive-input-required","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48403","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add option to make @Input() required when you need it to be\" (#48403)"},{"Id":"1484621855","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-08T13:16:18","Actor":"jnizet","Number":"48402","RawContent":null,"Title":"make it easier to access the submitted status of a form","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\nforms\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSeveral libraries (like ngx-valdemort or angular material) use the `submitted` property of the parent formGroupDirective in order to decide whether or not to display error messages. This works fine as long as the form group directive is only used on the top-level form, and not for nested form groups.\r\n\r\nSee [this working example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-zgmq7p?file=src%2Fapp%2Fform-field-error-example.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fform-field-error-example.html), using formGroupName for the nested form group and [this non-working example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-zgmq7p-2ygua5?file=src%2Fapp%2Fform-field-error-example.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fform-field-error-example.html), using formGroup for the nested form group.\r\n\r\nOne might say that using formGroupName is an easy-enough alternative but\r\n- with typed forms, it's less type-safe\r\n- it is possible, but more complex, to use it from a child component, because it requires a parent formGroupDirective in the same template, unless a view provider is specified for ControlContainer, but that's far from easy to find out, and has its limitations. AFAIK, most people pass the FormGroup as input to the child component, which then uses the formGroup directive.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThere are several solutions I can see\r\n\r\n1. being able, from the formGroupDirective, to navigate to its parent, recursively, until getting to the top-level one which contains the correct submitted value\r\n2. Add some additional topLevelFormGroup directive, which could use the new directive composition API, and which would get a reference to the formGroupDirective on the same host to give access to it. This TopLevelFormGroupDirective could then be injected in place of the FormGroupDirective to get direct access to the submitted flag\r\n3. Have the formGroupDirective store the submitted flag in its form group, just like it's done for similar flages such as touched, dirty. Since FormGroups do have a reference to their parent, libraries needing to access the submitted property could easily navigate to the top-level directive\r\n4. ???\r\n\r\nThe third solution seems like the most logical to me. It has the additional advantage that it could allow `FormGroup.reset()` to also reset the submitted flag, just as it resets the touched flags.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nClearly document that formGroupDirective is only ever supposed to be used for the top-level form (some parts of the doc suggest that, like the documentation of the `path` property of FormGroupDirective, but on the other hands, I've seen many usages of the formGroupDirective in the wild for nested form groups), and clearly document how to best delegate the display of a nested form group to a child component, using `formGroupName`. The best solution I've found is to use the following in the parent component:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div formGroupName=\"address\">\r\n  <app-address></app-address>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand use this in the decorator of the child component to be able to access the parent form group name:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: ControlContainer, useExisting: FormGroupName }]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this solution isn't without problems. For example: it forces every usage of address to be inside a formGroupName. It can't be used directly under a formGroupDirective. It's also not obvious at all.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48402","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"make it easier to access the submitted status of a form\" (#48402)"},{"Id":"1484241746","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-08T10:06:32","Actor":"iruthaya","Number":"48400","RawContent":null,"Title":"After conversion to a native app (apk) , a post with multipart/formdata stopped working  ","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen sent from a native app, the http request file content is transformed to [object Object]. \r\n\r\nmy code as follow\r\n\r\nimport { HttpClient,HttpHeaders } from \"@angular/common/http\";\r\n\r\n httpOptions : any = {\r\n        headers: new HttpHeaders({\r\n            'enctype'  : 'multipart/form-data'\r\n        })\r\n    };\r\n\r\npublic convertBlobToFile = (blb: Blob, f:string): File => {\r\n   return new File(\r\n      [blb as any], // cast as any\r\n      f, \r\n      {\r\n          lastModified: new Date().getTime(),\r\n          type: blb.type \r\n      }\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n\r\nlet file = this.convertBlobToFile(blob,this.fileName);\r\n\r\n let data = {\r\n          modifiedDoc : file,\r\n          approvalId : this.approvalId\r\n        }\r\n\r\n postModifiedDoc(data:any){  \r\n        let formData: FormData = new FormData();

The change broke esbuild's watchdog timer, which detects if the parent process no longer exists and then automatically exits esbuild. This hang happened when you ran node as a child process with the `stderr` stream set to `pipe` instead of `inherit`, in the child process you call esbuild's JS API and pass `incremental: true` but do not call `dispose()` on the returned `rebuild` object, and then call `process.exit()`. In that case the parent node process was still waiting for the esbuild process that was created by the child node process to exit. The change made in version 0.15.13 was trying to avoid using Go's `sync.WaitGroup` API incorrectly because the API is not thread-safe.

In order to fix this, the compiler has to run a transformer that converts this information into something like:\r\n```ts\r\nMyCmp.ctorParameters = () => [\r\n   { type: MyService }\r\n];\r\n```\r\nCf. https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/3a60063a54d850c50ce962a8a39ce01cfee71398/packages/compiler-cli/src/transformers/downlevel_decorators_transform/downlevel_decorators_transform.ts\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that it slows down community initiatives of integrating Angular with other tools. e.g. Vite, Vitest, SWC...\r\nThis forces tools to hack their way through. For instance, jest-preset-angular downloads the internal CLI transformer: https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular/blob/f24156ea1f7532c02c44d8d023b54623a4bccccd/scripts/prebuild.js#L9\r\n\r\n## `inject()` to the rescue\r\n\r\nThe good news is that an app using only `inject()` instead of constructor param types to retrieve dependencies will not need this transformer:\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyCmp {\r\n myService = inject(MyService);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with using `inject()` function this way is that it doesn't allow injecting dependencies manually. This means that all tests will need the `TestBed` or similar to control dependencies resolution.\r\nTo allow manual instantiation, the current alternative would be something **non-explicit, verbose and error-prone** like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyCmp {\r\n   // let's not do this\r\n  constructor(myService?: MyService) {\r\n    this.myService = myService ?? inject(MyService);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCompiler should bypass type-based dependency injection when a default value is set and the given type can't be resolved.\r\nThis would allow the following syntax which currently works if this transformer is disabled:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyCmp {\r\n  constructor(private myService = inject(MyService)) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the following advantages:\r\n- ✨ constructor parameters transformer is not needed anymore... so easier integration with existing tools\r\n- ✨ manual instantiation is still possible\r\n- ✨ all the benefits of `inject`: type-inference, consistent way of injecting class-based & injection-token based deps: `locale = inject(LOCALE_ID)`, controlling options (e.g. optional, self) through flags instead of decorators.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUse `inject()` and never instantiate manually.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47606","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow `inject()` usage as constructor parameter properties default\" (#47606)"},{"Id":"1393958513","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-03T00:44:06","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"47604","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(router): add a migration to remove `relativeLinkResolution` usages","State":"open","Body":"As of Angular v15, the deprecated `relativeLinkResolution` config option of the Router is removed.

Previously the `*` was required to be at the end of the pattern. It lets you do something like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"exports\": {\n        \"./features/*\": \"./features/*.js\",\n        \"./features/*.js\": \"./features/*.js\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    With this release, esbuild now supports these types of patterns too.\n\n-   Fix subpath imports with Yarn PnP ([#&#8203;2545](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2545))\n\n    Node has a little-used feature called [subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) which are package-internal imports that start with `#` and that go through the `imports` map in `package.json`. Previously esbuild had a bug that caused esbuild to not handle these correctly in packages installed via Yarn's \"Plug'n'Play\" installation strategy. The problem was that subpath imports were being checked after Yarn PnP instead of before. This release reorders these checks, which should allow subpath imports to work in this case.\n\n-   Link from JS to CSS in the metafile ([#&#8203;1861](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1861), [#&#8203;2565](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2565))\n\n    When you import CSS into a bundled JS file, esbuild creates a parallel CSS bundle next to your JS bundle. So if `app.ts` imports some CSS files and you bundle it, esbuild will give you `app.js` and `app.css`. You would then add both `<script src=\"app.js\"></script>` and `<link href=\"app.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">` to your HTML to include everything in the page. This approach is more efficient than having esbuild insert additional JavaScript into `app.js` that downloads and includes `app.css` because it means the browser can download and parse both the CSS and the JS in parallel (and potentially apply the CSS before the JS has even finished downloading).\n\n    However, sometimes it's difficult to generate the `<link>` tag. One case is when you've added `[hash]` to the [entry names](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#entry-names) setting to include a content hash in the file name. Then the file name will look something like `app-GX7G2SBE.css` and may change across subsequent builds. You can tell esbuild to generate build metadata using the `metafile` API option but the metadata only tells you which generated JS bundle corresponds to a JS entry point (via the `entryPoint` property), not which file corresponds to the associated CSS bundle. Working around this was hacky and involved string manipulation.\n\n    This release adds the `cssBundle` property to the metafile to make this easier. It's present on the metadata for the generated JS bundle and points to the associated CSS bundle. So to generate the HTML tags for a given JS entry point, you first find the output file with the `entryPoint` you are looking for (and put that in a `<script>` tag), then check for the `cssBundle` property to find the associated CSS bundle (and put that in a `<link>` tag).\n\n    One thing to note is that there is deliberately no `jsBundle` property mapping the other way because it's not a 1:1 relationship. Two JS bundles can share the same CSS bundle in the case where the associated CSS bundles have the same name and content.

I'm working on a project where feature is usually split into multiple directories, for example:\r\n\r\nprojects/libs/feature-name/\r\n- app\r\n- shared\r\n- model\r\n- store\r\n\r\nAfter migration when I try to create a library with a such scheme it is no longer possible, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n$ npx ng generate library projects/libs/feature/model                                                                                                                                                                                           ‹ruby-2.6.6›\r\nSchematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"projects/libs/feature/model\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path \"/name\" must match pattern \"^(?:@[a-zA-Z0-9-*~][a-zA-Z0-9-*._~]*/)?[a-zA-Z0-9-~][a-zA-Z0-9-._~]*$\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that there is a workaround that when we make a path alias to projects/libs/feature-name it will work, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npx ng generate library @feature-alias/model                                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this project its very inconvenient since we have 100 different features and we would need to alias almost each one of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```bash\r\n# create empty workspace\r\n ng new my-workspace --create-application false\r\n# in that workspace create a library with nested directories\r\ncd my-workspace/my-project\r\nnpx ng generate library projects/libs/feature/model\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nSchematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"projects/libs/feature/model\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path

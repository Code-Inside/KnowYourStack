There are **no specific actions** planned/needed at this point.\r\n\r\nCurrently a lot of logic in Forms is stored in classes (such as AbstractControl, FormControl, FormGroup, FormArray, Validators, etc). The code in these classes is not tree-shakable by Terser. Closure can tree-shake unused class methods, but it requires advanced optimization mode turned on (which may or may not be enabled for different apps for various reasons).\r\n\r\nThere are some PRs that add more logic (util methods) into AbstractControl-based classes (see #27222, #34210 and also related issues #27171, #34186). Adding more methods into AbstractControl-based classes would lead to additional payload size even if applications do not use them. It'd be great to have a way to add this kind of helpers/utils in a tree-shakable way (otherwise we won't be able to include them into the Forms code).\r\n\r\nOne possible solution to consider is creating standalone functions that would take the necessary controls as arguments are perform some actions inside, for example with the `moveControl` function (from #27222) that might look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Proposed in PR #27222:\r\nconst formArray = new FormArray(...);\r\nformArray.moveControl(/* from */ 2, /* to */ 5);\r\n\r\n// Possible tree-shaking-friendly scenario:\r\nimport {moveControl} from '@angular/forms';\r\n\r\nconst formArray = new FormArray(...);\r\nmoveControl(formArray, /* from */ 2, /* to */ 5);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: there is a lot of consideration that should be taken into account (such as backwards-compatibility, DX, API consistency and ergonomics, etc) before creating any helper methods and more research/discussion is needed (when this work is prioritized).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39640","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Investigate more tree-shaking-friendly approach for @angular/forms utils\" (#39640)"},{"Id":"741206649","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-12T01:59:52","Actor":"mrsegen","Number":"39639","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update term to match available type options","State":"open","Body":"The text said that scope had to match \"docs\".

In many cases currently, users are currently using a mixture of AOT and JIT to dynamically load a component. This doesn't work with any build optimizations (ie: terser and build optimizer), among other things due to the `ngJitMode: false` guards.\r\n\r\nUsing AOT/JIT interop with build optimizations is currently not supported as the main use cases for this appears to be unit testing scenarios, that is until the Dynamic view composition project which is currently listed on ng-elephant is finalized.\r\n\r\nUsers who are concerned about performance, security and bundle sizes shouldn't use AOT+JIT interop. Compile components at runtime is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in itself and shouldn't be used for production.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19016\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19321\r\nangular/angular#36255\r\nangular/angular#37216\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15510","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39624","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Create dynamic component loading documentation\" (#39624)"},{"Id":"739646276","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-10T07:00:58","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"39623","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(forms): more precise control cleanup","State":"open","Body":"Currently when an instance of the `FormControlName` directive is destroyed, the Forms package invokes\r\nthe `cleanUpControl` to clear all directive-specific logic (such as validators, onChange handlers,\r\netc) from a bound control.

For me, it sounds logical what @mhevery wrote in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35383#issuecomment-590479091, stating that it is intended behaviour for `host.class` being fed into `@Input`. There's no further argumentation, except of a tiny note on further offline/internal discussions (lacking their outcome) and then, the PR chimes in w/o any further explanation of why\r\n\r\nI also feel like it shouldn't be intended for `host : { class: 'class-name' }` to behave differently and that Ivy should've introduced this new behaviour as a breaking change (instead of fixing #35383). So, I'd like to request two things:\r\n1. Could you clarify, why it was _fixed_? In the discussion of #35383, there is no info (except a note on internal/offline discussion).\r\n2. Based on the above: Start the discussion of introducing a breaking change bringing back to how it has been introduced by Ivy in Angular 9 and streamline the experience.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think of the change introduced in PR #35889 being a breaking change. Not for anyone coming from View Engine, but for everyone (like me), coming from Angular 9.0 (see **Real World Example** below).\r\n\r\n#### Real World Example\r\n\r\nI'm using a library catching the `class` input to get control over the applied classes (albeit not the best pattern, this is officially supported). This library has some nice icons I want to use as a remove button for Material's Chips, so I added the `matChipRemove` directive having `host { class: 'mat-chip-remove' }` (and some more stuff). In Angular 9.0, this worked perfectly fine but after upgrading to Angular 9.1 (and 10.x), it broke solely due to the update (which was a pain to debug, by the way ü§∑).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI would've liked to start this discussion in the mentioned issue but it's locked so I thought this is the right place for it.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.35`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7035)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.34...7.0.35)\n\n-   Add migration guide link to PostCSS 8 error text.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

information ([#&#8203;38539](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38539)) ([297c060](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/297c060))\n-   **router:** use `ngDevMode` to tree-shake error messages in router ([#&#8203;38674](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38674)) ([db21c4f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/db21c4f))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **platform-server:** If you use `useAbsoluteUrl` to setup `platform-server`, you now need to\n    also specify `baseUrl`.\n    We are intentionally making this a breaking change in a minor release,\n    because if `useAbsoluteUrl` is set to `true` then the behavior of the\n    application could be unpredictable, resulting in issues that are hard to\n    discover but could be affecting production environments.\n-   **compiler:** TypeScript 3.9 is no longer supported, please upgrade to TypeScript 4.0.\n-   **router:** \\* The `initialNavigation` property for the options in\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` no longer supports `legacy_disabled`,\n    `legacy_enabled`, `true`, or `false` as valid values.\n    `legacy_enabled` (the old default) is instead `enabledNonBlocking`\n-   `enabled` is deprecated as a valid value for the\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` `initialNavigation` option. `enabledBlocking`\n    has been introduced to replace it\n-   **router:** preserveQueryParams has been removed, use\n    queryParamsHandling=\"preserve\" instead\n-   **router:**  If you were accessing the `RouterLink` values of `queryParams`,\n    `fragment` or `queryParamsHandling` you might need to relax the typing to also\n    accept `undefined` and `null`. ([#&#8203;39151](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39151))\n-   **core:** \\* `ViewEncapsulation.Native` has been removed. Use `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom` instead. Existing\n    usages will be updated automatically by `ng update`.\n-   **compiler-cli:** Expressions within ICUs are now type-checked again, fixing a regression\n    in Ivy. This may cause compilation failures if errors are found in\n    expressions that appear within an ICU. Please correct these expressions\n    to resolve the type-check errors.\n-   **forms:** Directives in the `@angular/forms` package used to have `any[]` as a type of `validators` and\n    `asyncValidators` arguments in constructors. Now these arguments are properly typed, so if your\n    code relies on directive constructor types it may require some updates to improve type safety.\n-   **forms:** Type of AbstractFormControl.parent now includes null. `null` is now included in the types of .parent. If you don't already have a check for this case,\n    the TypeScript compiler might complain. A v11 migration exists which adds the non-null assertion\n    operator where necessary. In an unlikely case your code was testing the parent against undefined with strict equality,\n    you'll need to change this to `=== null` instead, since the parent is now explicitly initialized\n    with `null` instead of being left `undefined`.\n-   **packaging:** In v10, IE 9, 10, and IE mobile support was deprecated. In v11, Angular framework removes IE 9,\n    10, and IE mobile support completely.\n    Supporting outdated browsers like these increases bundle size, code complexity, and test load,\n    and also requires time and effort that could be spent on improvements to the framework.\n    For example, fixing issues can be more difficult, as a straightforward fix for modern browsers\n    could break old ones that have quirks due to not receiving updates from vendors.\n-   **platform-webworker:** [@&#8203;angular/platform-webworker](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-webworker) and [@&#8203;angular/platform-webworker-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-webworker-dynamic)\n    have been removed as they were deprecated in v8\n-   **common:** The `slice` pipe now returns `null` for the `undefined` input value,\n    which is consistent with the behavior of most pipes. If you rely on\n    `undefined` being the result in that case, you now need to check for it\n    explicitly.\n-   **common:** The typing of the `keyvalue` pipe has been fixed to report that for\n    input objects that have `number` keys, the result will contain the\n    string representation of the keys. This was already the case and the\n    code has simply been updated to reflect this. Please update the\n    consumers of the pipe output if they were relying on the incorrect\n    types. Note that this does not affect use cases where the input values\n    are `Map`s, so if you need to preserve `number`s, this is an effective\n    way.\n-   **common:** The signatures of the number pipes now explicitly state which types are\n    accepted. This should only cause issues in corner cases, as any other\n    values would result in runtime exceptions.\n-   **common:** The signature of the `date` pipe now explicitly states which types are\n    accepted. This should only cause issues in corner cases, as any other\n    values would result in runtime exceptions.\n-   **common:** The async pipe no longer claims to return `undefined` for an input that\n    was typed as `undefined`. Note that the code actually returned `null` on\n    `undefined` inputs. In the unlikely case you were relying on this,\n    please fix the typing of the consumers of the pipe output.\n-   **common:** The case conversion pipes no longer let falsy values through. They now\n    map both `null` and `undefined` to `null` and raise an exception on\n    invalid input (`0`, `false`, `NaN`) just like most \"common pipes\". If\n    your code required falsy values to pass through, you need to handle them\n    explicitly.\n-   **router:** While the new parameter types allow a variable of type\n    `NavigationExtras` to be passed in, they will not allow object literals,\n    as they may only specify known properties. They will also not accept\n    types that do not have properties in common with the ones in the `Pick`.\n    To fix this error, only specify properties from the `NavigationExtras` which are\n    actually used in the respective function calls or use a type assertion\n    on the object or variable: `as NavigationExtras`.\n-   **router:** This commit changes the default value of\n    `relativeLinkResolution` from `'legacy'` to `'default'`. If your\n    application previously used the default by not specifying a value in the\n    `ExtraOptions` and uses relative links when navigating from children of\n    empty path routes, you will need to update your `RouterModule` to\n    specifically specify `'legacy'` for `relativeLinkResolution`.\n    See <https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions#relativeLinkResolution>\n    for more details.\n-   **core:** If you call `TestBed.overrideProvider` after TestBed initialization, provider overrides are not applied. This\n    behavior is consistent with other override methods (such as `TestBed.overrideDirective`, etc) but they\n    throw an error to indicate that, when the check was missing in the `TestBed.overrideProvider` function.\n    Now calling `TestBed.overrideProvider` after TestBed initialization also triggers an\n    error, thus there is a chance that some tests (where `TestBed.overrideProvider` is\n    called after TestBed initialization) will start to fail and require updates to move `TestBed.overrideProvider` calls\n    before TestBed initialization is completed.\n-   **router:** This change corrects the argument order when calling\n    RouteReuseStrategy#shouldReuseRoute. Previously, when evaluating child\n    routes, they would be called with the future and current arguments would\n    be swapped. If your RouteReuseStrategy relies specifically on only the future\n    or current snapshot state, you may need to update the shouldReuseRoute\n    implementation's use of \"future\" and \"current\" ActivateRouteSnapshots.\n-   **common:** The locale data API has been marked as returning readonly arrays, rather\n    than mutable arrays, since these arrays are shared across calls to the\n    API. If you were mutating them (e.g. calling `sort()`, `push()`, `splice()`, etc)\n    then your code will not longer compile. If you need to mutate the array, you\n    should now take a copy (e.g. by calling `slice()`) and mutate the copy.\n-   **common:** When passing a date-time formatted string to the `DatePipe` in a format that contains\n    fractions of a millisecond, the milliseconds will now always be rounded down rather than\n    to the nearest millisecond. Most applications will not be affected by this change. If this is not the desired behaviour\n    then consider pre-processing the string to round the millisecond part before passing\n    it to the `DatePipe`.\n-   **core:** CollectionChangeRecord has been removed, use IterableChangeRecord instead\n-   **forms:** Previously if FormControl, FormGroup and FormArray class instances had async validators\n    defined at initialization time, the status change event was not emitted once async validator\n    completed. After this change the status event is emitted into the `statusChanges` observable.\n    If your code relies on the old behavior, you can filter/ignore this additional status change\n    event.\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   **compiler:** remove support for TypeScript 3.9 ([#&#8203;39313](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39313)) ([736e064](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/736e064))\n-   **router:** Adjust type of parameter in navigateByUrl and createUrlTree to be more accurate ([#&#8203;38227](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38227)) ([e4f4d18](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/e4f4d18)), closes [#&#8203;18798](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/18798)\n\n#### 10.2.3 (2020-11-09)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler:** ensure that i18n message-parts have the correct source-span ([#&#8203;39589](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39589)) ([e67a331](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/e67a331))\n-   **compiler:** skipping leading whitespace should not break placeholder source-spans ([#&#8203;39589](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39589)) ([2b684b7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2b684b7)), closes [#&#8203;39195](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39195)\n-   **compiler-cli:** avoid duplicate diagnostics about unknown pipes ([#&#8203;39517](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39517)) ([861e4fa](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/861e4fa))\n-   **compiler-cli:** do not drop non-Angular decorators when downleveling ([#&#8203;39577](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39577)) ([1c6cf8a](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/1c6cf8a)), closes [#&#8203;39574](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39574)\n\n#### 10.2.2 (2020-11-04)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler-cli:** report missing pipes when `fullTemplateTypeCheck` is disabled ([#&#8203;39320](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39320)) ([71d0063](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/71d0063)), closes [#&#8203;38195](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38195)\n-   **core:** markDirty() should only mark flags when really scheduling tick.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.35`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7035)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.34...7.0.35)\n\n-   Add migration guide link to PostCSS 8 error text.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Navigate to the StackBlitz link provided above \r\n2. Tab to the Menu component\r\n3. Verify whether keyboard interactions for Menu works as per ARIA specifications.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nKeyboard interactions for Menu needs to work as per ARIA specifications. Here is the keyboard support for Accessible Menus as per the ARIA specifications.\r\n\r\nThe menus are keyboard accessible:\r\n\r\nActivate the triggering element using the keyboard.\r\n**Press the UP and DOWN Arrow keys to move focus between the menu options.**\r\nPress the LEFT and RIGHT Arrow keys to open or close submenus.\r\nPress ENTER to activate a menu option.\r\nPress ESCAPE to close the currently open menu.\r\n**Press TAB or set focus back on the triggering element to close the menu and all submenus.**\r\nMouse users can click the desired menu option as usual.\r\n\r\nOut of this, there are a couple of keyboard behaviors that doesn't work as expected. When the focus moves to the button that triggers the menu, even though the enter key activates and opens the menu, activating the Up/Down arrow keys must open the menu and move focus to the last and the first menuitem respectively. Also when the user activates the \"Tab\" keystroke from inside the menu, focus needs to return back to the triggering element that opened the menu.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nCurrently activating the \"Tab\" keystroke moves focus to the next interactive element in the page. Focus needs to move back to the menu button that triggered it.\r\n\r\nWhen focus moves to the menu and the user uses Up/Down arrow keys, there is no action that is triggered to open the menu.\r\n\r\n#### Reference Links:\r\n1. http://whatsock.com/tsg/\r\n2. https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/application-menus/\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n- Angular: 10.2.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): all\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): all \r\n\r\n<img width=\"749\" alt=\"Menu - Keyboard Issue\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71451445/98718172-128b1400-235c-11eb-8f13-b274141b3905.png\">","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21004","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Menu): [Accessibility] - Keyboard Support and interactions for the menu is not fully supported\" (#21004)"},{"Id":"740119241","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-10T17:52:00","Actor":"mrmokwa","Number":"21003","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material-experimental): Add typography path in readme","State":"open","Body":"Readme is missing the import to typography that is necessary for `@include angular-material-mdc-typography();`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21003","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(material-experimental): Add typography path in readme\" (#21003)"},{"Id":"740101837","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-10T17:50:24","Actor":"annieyw","Number":"21002","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump version to 11.0.0-rc.3 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21002","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump version to 11.0.0-rc.3 w/ changelog\" (#21002)"},{"Id":"739817596","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-10T16:51:59","Actor":"DickerCan","Number":"21001","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelect): MatSelect overlay has transparent background when loading options","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. create an angular project with mat select\r\n2. use long option list (500+ entries)\r\n3. open select on scroll using the scrollbar\r\n(on stackblitz the bug does not occur)\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen select is too slow to show all options, it shows white background until options are loaded.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n![B00732B2-23CF-43E8-AF44-60C224410008](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22917740/98666692-a86b7280-234d-11eb-8582-3f0ceb39b2d8.GIF)\r\n\r\nThe background goes transparent when loading options\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21001","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatSelect): MatSelect overlay has transparent background when loading options\" (#21001)"},{"Id":"739516302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-10T15:46:53","Actor":"obumnwabude","Number":"20998","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatInput, MatFormField): Deletes contents of sibling input when removed","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://stackblitz.com/fork/components-issue\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-5gkex1\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Add a button to the mat-form-field element for removing that particular formField from the formArray \r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\nThat when you click the remove button of a particular formField, it just removes it.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nIt removes that formfield and goes further to replace the contents of the formField preceding it with its current contents, and if it was empty, it equally replaces the contents of the preceding formField's input/textarea with an empty string (in other words, clears its contents)\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\nThat when the remove button of a particular formField is clicked, it should only remove that formField, if it goes further to bring focus into the input/textarea of the formField preceding it, it should not replace or clear the contents of this preceding formField\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.2.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Linux\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20998","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatInput, MatFormField): Deletes contents of sibling input when removed\" (#20998)"},{"Id":"739582667","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-10T15:43:11","Actor":"mahesh-shinde-13","Number":"20999","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-autocomplete): Ensures ARIA input field has an accessible name (#mat-autocomplete).","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://stackblitz.com/fork/components-issue\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2. \r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nARIA input field should be present.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74227921/98630772-e2367c00-2341-11eb-8ddf-cac4f329adb3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20999","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(mat-autocomplete): Ensures ARIA input field has an accessible name (#mat-autocomplete).\" (#20999)"},{"Id":"739704163","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-10T15:42:32","Actor":"tomekwszelaki","Number":"21000","RawContent":null,"Title":"id is not set on matEndDate input of the date range picker, why?","State":"closed","Body":"Comparing the `matStartDate` and `matEndDate` elements I noticed the `matEndDate` doesn't have the id set:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1482166/98649424-e1005180-2337-11eb-9e40-46b88c578cee.png)\r\n\r\nIs that by design or just an oversight?\r\n\r\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21000","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"id is not set on matEndDate input of the date range picker, why?\" (#21000)"},{"Id":"739503360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-10T12:21:04","Actor":"jordankkk","Number":"20996","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(drag-drop): dragging only work well on first one (only on mobile device)","State":"closed","Body":"#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\nafter first dragdrop list (movies1),  when dragging (movies2, movies3 etc..) cannot drop like normal\r\n\r\n[demo](https://streamable.com/e6mxh1)\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\nthe second dragdrop list (movies2) should work same as first dragdrop list (movies1)\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 10.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.2.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 86.0.4240.193\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <div cdkDropList class=\"example-list\" (cdkDropListDropped)=\"drop1($event)\">\r\n      <div class=\"example-box\" *ngFor=\"let movie of movies1\" cdkDrag>{{movie}}</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div cdkDropList class=\"example-list\" (cdkDropListDropped)=\"drop2($event)\">\r\n      <div class=\"example-box\" *ngFor=\"let movie of movies2\" cdkDrag>{{movie}}</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nmovies1 = [\r\n    'Episode I -

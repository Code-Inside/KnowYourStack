The best information I could find was:\r\n\r\n> @[ViewChildren](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewChildren) and @[ContentChildren](https://angular.io/api/core/ContentChildren) queries are already \"dynamic\" by default and don't support static resolution. \r\n\r\nTraditionally the `static` option is useful to developers because it allows for the value of `@ViewChild` [to be consumed in ngOnInit](https://angular.io/guide/static-query-migration#what-does-this-flag-mean). There is also an additional performance benefit too since it only ever gets calculated once, even if for most components this would be negligible.\r\n\r\nThere is another (deprecated) option '`emitDistinctChangesOnly`' for `@ViewChildren`](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewChildren) intended to only emit a new if the `QueryList` has actually changed. I haven't looked into the details of this, but I'm assuming it does some kind of identity comparison for items in the `QueryList`. \r\n\r\nWhen playing with the new `viewChildren()` signal in Angular 17.2 I found that the signal yields duplicate values even if the list has not changed. You can get an infinite loop if this value is used in certain ways in the template because Angular keeps recalculating it:\r\n\r\n> Error: NG0103: Infinite change detection while trying to refresh views. \r\n\r\nIn the attached example my app component behaves as a custom grid control. There are a number of `<ng-template column-template></ng-template>` columns defined, that are captured to a signal via `viewChildren(ColumnTemplateDirective)`. In my real project the component uses `mat-table` but in this example I just output the list of columns.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when stamping out the columns new views are created, which causes `viewChildren` to be recalculated. Even though the list of `ColumnTemplateDirective` is unchanged it 'emits' a new value causing the infinite loop.\r\n\r\n### Notes about my repro\r\nOpen stackblitz console to see the error\r\n\r\nMy reproduction of this issue can easily be 'fixed' and I am well aware of ways in which it could be.\r\n\r\n1) I could create a `computed` with a custom equals that takes the `viewChildren` list and ignores duplicate values.\r\n2) The `@for` in my repro that iterates through the `columns` computed signal uses object identity. If changed to `track col.id` then the problem goes away because the template inside doesn't keep getting recreated. \r\n\r\nI don't know exactly what triggers `viewChildren` to recalculate itself, but I had to add an extra 'scope' with `@if (true)` in order to trigger it to do so. \r\n\r\nFrankly it was harder to create this repro than I expected. It was much easier with `mat-table` to trigger the infinite loop, but I wanted to stay within core for the repro.\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nUltimately what I would hope to see is two things:\r\n\r\n1) Identity checking of elements returned from `viewChildren()` such that unchanged children do not update the signal value.\r\n2) A way to use something like `static` for `viewChildren()` in order to only calculate the list one time. I don't think it would make sense for `contentChildren()`. This would primarily be for performance reasons when needing to capture `viewChildren` that are known to be static. This was easier before with `QueryList` that was an observable.\r\n\r\nI can easily work around the duplicate viewChildren value, but I am more concerned about performance especially since my component displays a grid with thousands of cells and Angular is probably continuously looking through the whole table for new templates. \n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-model-inputs-mv3bsn\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: NG0103: Infinite change detection while trying to refresh views.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular: 17.2.0-rc.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54376","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Signals: viewChildren() gets new values even when query list is unchanged, and performance is hampered by lack of a 'static' option\" (#54376)"},{"Id":"2129958910","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T16:48:32","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"54392","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): return the same children query results if there are no changes","State":"closed","Body":"Assure that the same readonly array corresponding to the children query results is returned for cases where a query is marked as dirty but there were no actual changes to the content of the results array (this can happen if a view is added and removed thus marking queries as dirty but not influencing final results).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54392","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): return the same children query results if there are no changes\" (#54392)"},{"Id":"2130532463","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T16:44:20","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"54396","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(zone.js): add missing APIs to Node.js `fs` patch","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates the list of Node.js `fs` APIs to be patched because\r\nthey haven't been updated for a long time.

Two GraphQL requests, with the same URL, are being fired on the server-side. When hydration kicks in on the client-side, the same response body is restored for the both requests, leading to an error since data structures expected for each response do not match. Disabling Javascript (effectively blocking rehydration) renders the page correctly, with both a movie name and a character name.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to add a dummy request param to one of the URLs, but this is not practical for real life projects where the number of requests can grow rapidly.\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/ahmadshahwan/angular-ssr-with-post-request-cache-transfer\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n`main-L2QLRZ2I.js:7 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')` in the clients console due to data structure mismatch between what is expected in the response body, and what is returned from the transferred cache.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.1.3\r\nNode: 21.2.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router, ssr\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1701.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular             17.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis issue was originally reported [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77521480/angular-ssr-app-cache-only-one-http-request) (not by me), but it didn't seem to catch much attention.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54377","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SSR with POST requests cache transfer enable is buggy when multiple POST-requests are sent to the same URL, with different bodies\" (#54377)"},{"Id":"2128660439","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-10T20:06:23","Actor":"dentiman","Number":"54374","RawContent":null,"Title":"Proposal: Create new <ng-host> html element as root element in template for more native hostBinding","State":"closed","Body":"General idea is to keep host binding properties as attributes for new root <ng-host> element in\r\ncomponent template instead of using @HostBinding and @HostListener decorators or host metadata property in @Component decorator.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current host binding\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-button',\r\n  templateUrl: './app-button.component.html',\r\n  host: {\r\n    '[class]': 'class',\r\n    '(click)': 'handleClick()',\r\n    '[attr.disabled]': 'disabled'\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal host binding\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-button',\r\n  template: `\r\n        <ng-host class=\"...\" (click)=\"handleClick()\" [disabled]=\"disabled\"  >\r\n            <div>Content</div>\r\n        </ng-host>\r\n`\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n- Attribute autocomplete better in html than in .ts file\r\n- better readability, especially when we have long static css class  list\r\n- no need to use @HostBinding and @HostListener decorators or host property in @Component decorator\r\n\r\nrelated to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/19119","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54374","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: Create new <ng-host> html element as root element in template for more native hostBinding\" (#54374)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2131259559","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T00:53:18","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27085","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): downgrade copy-webpack-plugin to workaround Node.js support issue","State":"open","Body":"The `copy-webpack-plugin@12` package has a dependency on the `globby@14` package. The recently released `globby@14.0.1` uses the `merge-streams@2.1.0` package which requires a minimum Node.js version higher than the officially supported 18.13 for the Angular CLI. Due to both `globby` and `merge-streams` being transitive dependencies in end-user projects, the Angular CLI cannot directly control the package versions. However, `copy-webpack-plugin@11` uses `globby@13` which is not affected by the Node.js version problem. To workaround the Node.js compatibility problem, `copy-webpack-plugin` has been downgraded to version 11.0.0 which is the latest version in the 11 major for the package. The `copy-webpack-plugin` is only used with the Webpack-based builders when in watch mode. From a review of the commit history between 11.0.0 and 12.0.2 (latest at the time of this commit), it appears the only notable changes are several performance improvements and the major version update of `globby`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27085","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): downgrade copy-webpack-plugin to workaround Node.js support issue\" (#27085)"},{"Id":"2130912115","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T21:21:50","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27084","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): correct several comment typos","State":"closed","Body":"There were several typos in the comments for the Angular schematics utilities.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/27084","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@schematics/angular): correct several comment typos\" (#27084)"},{"Id":"2130905818","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T20:11:17","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27083","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/schematics-cli): rename schematic template files with a template extension","State":"open","Body":"Files that contain template instructions should include a `.template` extension to prevent them from being treated as TypeScript/JSON/etc. files.

Specifically, when users attempt to scroll through the options presented in the autocomplete dropdown, the scroll action unexpectedly affects the underlying webpage instead of the dropdown list. This behavior disrupts the user's ability to select an option from the autocomplete list and significantly impacts the usability of the component. The issue has been consistently observed across a variety of devices and web browsers, indicating a broader compatibility or event handling problem within the component.\r\n\r\nVideo Demonstration of the Issue:\r\nhttps://javamaniac.github.io/angular-autocomplete-example/screen-20240212-143204.mp4\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/javamaniac/angular-autocomplete-example\r\n\r\nThe issue with mat-autocomplete scrolling is intermittent and does not have a consistent reproduction sequence. However, it generally involves interactions with the autocomplete component on a mobile device. Below are steps that have sometimes led to the issue, though it may require repeating certain actions or experimenting with the sequence to observe the problem.\r\n\r\nPotential Reproduction Sequences:\r\n\r\nBasic Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nExtended Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Select any option from the list.\r\n3. Clear the selected option (erase the choice).\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options again.\r\n\r\nExternal Interaction:\r\n1. Open the autocomplete dropdown.\r\n2. Click outside the dropdown to close it.\r\n3. Re-open the dropdown.\r\n4. Attempt to scroll through the options.\r\n\r\nNote: The issue may not manifest on the first attempt and could require varying the sequence of actions, such as selecting and clearing choices multiple times or opening and closing the dropdown before scrolling attempts are made. The problem appears to be more likely to occur after interacting with the dropdown in some way (selecting options, erasing choices, or clicking outside the dropdown) before attempting to scroll through the options again.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDragging (scrolling) within the mat-autocomplete dropdown should scroll through the autocomplete options.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAttempting to scroll through the autocomplete options results in the page itself scrolling.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16, 17 (issue likely affects older versions as well)\r\n- CDK/Material: 16, 17\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Edge, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android, iOS\r\n\r\nDevices tested:\r\n- Google Pixel 6 (Chrome, Edge)\r\n- iPhone SE (Chrome, Safari)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28581","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(material/autocomplete): Intermittent Scrolling Issue with mat-autocomplete on Mobile Devices\" (#28581)"},{"Id":"2130777176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T19:32:53","Actor":"zarend","Number":"28580","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/list): fix m3 demo trailing icon color","State":"closed","Body":"Fix trailing icon color in M3 List demo.

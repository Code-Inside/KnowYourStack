This change ensures that the errors are\r\nsurfaced.

There are two alternatives to\r\ncatch the errors:\r\n* Instead of waiting for automatic change detection to happen, trigger\r\n  it synchronously and expect the error. For example, a jasmine test\r\n  could write `expect(() => TestBed.inject(ApplicationRef).tick()).toThrow()`\r\n* `TestBed` will reject any outstanding `ComponentFixture.whenStable` promises.

This change is intended to make the framework lighter by relying on built-in browser capabilities. However, I've encountered an issue where `Intl.DateTimeFormat` does not provide equivalent short day names as Angular's `getLocaleDayNames`.\r\n\r\n### Using Angular:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { getLocaleDayNames, FormStyle, TranslationWidth } from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\nconst angularDayNames = getLocaleDayNames('en-US', FormStyle.Standalone, TranslationWidth.Short);\r\nconsole.log(angularDayNames); // [\"Su\", \"Mo\", \"Tu\", \"We\", \"Th\", \"Fr\", \"Sa\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using Intl:\r\n```ts\r\nconst intlFormatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { weekday: 'short' });\r\nconst intlDayNames = [];\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < 7; i+=1) {\r\n  const date = new Date(Date.UTC(2021, 0, i + 3)); // 3th January 2021 is a Sunday\r\n  intlDayNames.push(intlFormatter.format(date));\r\n}\r\nconsole.log(intlDayNames); // [\"Sun\", \"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my native language Polish situation is worse, in Intl for Sunday get e.g. \"niedz.\" (small letter, dot) instead of Angular, 3 letters \"nie\".\r\n\r\n## Where Did This Come From?\r\n\r\nIn the ECMAScript Internationalization API ([ecma402](https://tc39.es/ecma402/#datetimeformat-objects)) specification, there is a note:\r\n> It is recommended that implementations use the locale and calendar dependent strings provided by the Common Locale Data Repository (available at https://cldr.unicode.org/), and use CLDR \"abbreviated\" strings for DateTimeFormat \"short\" strings, and CLDR \"wide\" strings for DateTimeFormat \"long\" strings.\r\n\r\nThis explains why `Intl.DateTimeFormat`  uses the \"abbreviated\" format for \"short\" strings. The ICU library, which `Intl` relies on, follows these guidelines. You can check these values in the ICU data files, such as [this one for English](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/main/icu4c/source/data/locales/en.txt#L904).\r\nUnfortunately, there is no way to get the \"Short\" values from `Intl` as its \"short\" always returns \"abbreviated\".\r\n\r\n### What I Expect\r\n\r\nI doubt that ECMA or ICU will change their behavior regarding these formats. Therefore, I would like Angular to provide a solution that is compatible with the old behavior. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular Version: 18.0.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAdding a `weekdaysICU` option to `Intl.DateTimeFormat` would provide a much-needed compatibility layer for developers transitioning from Angular's `getLocaleDayNames` to the Intl API, ensuring that day names are formatted as expected without requiring additional libraries or workarounds.

In the generated file \"m3-theme.scss\" in the bottom add \"system-variables-prefix: test\" to both color and typography:\r\n```\r\n$light-theme: mat.define-theme((\r\n  color: (\r\n    theme-type: light,\r\n    primary: $_primary,\r\n    tertiary: $_tertiary,\r\n    use-system-variables: true,\r\n    system-variables-prefix: test\r\n  ),\r\n  typography: (\r\n    use-system-variables: true,\r\n    system-variables-prefix: test\r\n  ),\r\n));\r\n```\r\n4.

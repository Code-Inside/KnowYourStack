The primary goal was to mitigate a\r\nTypeScript limitation/issue that surfaces in Angular projects due to the heavy\r\nreliance on type metadata being captured for DI. Additionally this is a\r\npre-requisite of making `tsickle` optional in the Angular bazel toolchain.\r\n\r\nSee: 401ef71ae5b01be95d124184a0b6936fc453a5d4 for more context on this.\r\n\r\nAnother (less important) goal was to make sure that the CLI can re-use\r\nthis transformer for its JIT mode compilation. The CLI (as outlined in\r\nthe commit mentioned above), already has a transformer for downleveling\r\nconstructor parameters. We want to avoid this duplication and exported\r\nthe transform through the tooling-private compiler entry-point.\r\n\r\nEarly experiments in using this transformer over the current one, highlighted\r\nthat in JIT, class decorators cannot be downleveled. Angular relies on those\r\nto be invoked immediately for JIT (so that factories etc. are generated upon loading)\r\n\r\nThe transformer we exposed, always downleveles such class decorators\r\nthough, so that would break CLI's JIT mode. We can address the CLI's\r\nneeds by adding another flag to skip class decorators. This will allow\r\nus to continue with the goal of de-duplication.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37545","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(compiler-cli): skip class decorators in tooling constructor parameters transform\" (#37545)"},{"Id":"637283425","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-11T21:04:08","Actor":"david-bulte","Number":"37544","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blur Event Form Field prevents Submit button's Click event Handler ","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n@angular/forms\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMaybe I am doing something wrong, because this seems a very common use case. I have a form with some required fields. \"On blur\" triggers validation. Underneath each field, there is a div showing an error message when there is an error. The submit button should always be clickable. \r\n\r\nWhen a required field now has focus, and I click on the submit button (through moving the mouse, so *not* using the [tab] key), the 'error' message is shown, but the submit button itself does not call its submit() method.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the field's blur event is triggered first, which makes the form rerender. Should the error message *not* push the submit button down the page, the submit button's click event would be captured after the rerender of the page, and all would be fine. \r\n\r\nNote that if I would trigger the submit button through a 'mousedown' event, it works. But this is not very developer friendly. \r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-aywlkp\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n9\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37544","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blur Event Form Field prevents Submit button's Click event Handler \" (#37544)"},{"Id":"637215563","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-11T20:35:26","Actor":"rafaeldafranca","Number":"37540","RawContent":null,"Title":"Using *ngFor to fill options has a problem in iphone devices","State":"closed","Body":"I'm filling my select element with ngFor and works fine on pc browsers and android.\r\nWhen I test in iphone device, it seens that I doesn't  select anything.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22636978/84421849-88931f80-abf2-11ea-956a-d268f4f9f041.png)\r\n\r\nIn pc/android browsers \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22636978/84421997-c1cb8f80-abf2-11ea-87bf-67cfd6c555b8.png)\r\n\r\nIn Iphone \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22636978/84422255-20910900-abf3-11ea-81e9-79a187e634c2.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37540","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Using *ngFor to fill options has a problem in iphone devices\" (#37540)"},{"Id":"637262143","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-11T19:23:26","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"37543","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): error when invoking callbacks registered via ViewRef.onDestroy","State":"open","Body":"Invoking a callback registered through `ViewRef.onDestroy` throws an error, because we weren't registering it correctly in the internal data structure.

This was not an issue with v9.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOriginally reported in rules_nodejs: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/1932. I'll summarize the the main points here.\r\n\r\n@alan-agius4 did some preliminary analysis:\r\n\r\n\"This is the result that In version 10, incremental type-checking was introduced in Ivy, instead of a global type-checking file we now have a type-checking file for each file.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems here that I can see here.\r\n\r\nIn tsc_wrapped, the return of setupCompilation is ignored. https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript/blob/c4b325859b8d2c0579b094c67f449f1c3143271e/internal/tsc_wrapped/tsc_wrapped.ts#L389 This returns 2 pieces of information, files are shouldn't be emitted and files which shouldn't be checked for diagnostics. This will cause 2 extra files to be emitted for each original source file. myfile.ngtypecheck.d.ts and myfile.ngtypecheck.js.\r\n\r\nIn the TS source file, a triple-slash reference to the type-checking file is added, however this is not removed when emitting the DTS, this seems to be more of a bug in the plugin itself.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if maybe the first issue should be handled directly by NG Compiler, maybe sometime similar to ngtsc.wrapHost, because I am seeing that anyone who uses the plugin API will need to filter out those files from being emitted.\r\n\r\nI did create a reproduction without Bazel https://github.com/alan-agius4/ngtsc-plugin-demo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed the fix itself needs to happen at a NG plugin level, Unless you want to add temporary patch in rules_typescript.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's not clear to me who will address point 1 in rules_typescript.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had a chat with Alex R, he mentioned that the plugin is still experimental/in development and is not production ready and not surprised at all that there are such issues since the plugin API itself is not complete (it‚Äôs about half way there) nor rigorously tested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSo far this is reproduced in a rules_nodejs PR: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/1932\r\n\r\nIts a bit tricky to run in there so I'll post a minimal repo with Bazel here if needed. @alan-agius4 created a reproduction without bazel: https://github.com/alan-agius4/ngtsc-plugin-demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal

After run server I only see  \r\n> 'PRRRRROOOXXXXYYYY INIT'\r\n> ..\r\n> [HPM] Subscribed to http-proxy events:  [ 'proxyRes', 'error', 'close' ]\r\n(if I use `bypass` I don't see 'proxyRes')\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nJust not works - header is not included to serwer response (and on server console I DON'T see 'PRRRRROOOXXXXYYYY RUN' so I guess onProxyRes/bypass function is never  triggered).

I have to kill the \"ng serve\" and relaunch it to be able to see the library changes  .\r\nWhat's weird is that when I made change in library, the app watcher still detects that something has changed somewhere and rebuild the app.\r\nAlso changes made in the library controller are shown immediately, only changes in html and css will not show, and needs a kill + relaunch ng serve.\r\n\r\nI've searched in the node_module/library_folder (which is a symlink) and I do see the html/css changes in the sources.\r\n\r\nI do have the  \"preserveSymlinks\": true property in app's angular.json\r\nIvy is disabled for now.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 9.1.7\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.6\r\nNode: 13.7.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: No\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.901.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.1.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.1.6\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                       9.1.6\r\n@angular/flex-layout               9.0.0-beta.31\r\n@angular/material                  9.2.3\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   9.2.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.1.6\r\n@schematics/angular                9.1.6\r\n@schematics/update                 0.901.6\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.3\r\nrxjs                               6.5.5\r\ntypescript                         3.8.3\r\nwebpack                            4.42.0\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

This is the case for chromium on macOS, where\r\nthe browser test inputs (including chromium) are extracted from the remote cache, but\r\nnot fully so that the test action inputs will be incomplete on disk. Then later, the remote cache `SpawnResult` lookup for existing test results fails with an IO exception\r\n(as an input file is missing on disk when the merkle tree is built up).\r\n\r\nOne might wonder why this doesn't surface with RBE then. This is most likely\r\n(not confirmed) because the remote containers are linux based, and do not fail writing\r\nthese paths with a space when Bazel opens a file descriptor through a JNI wrapper.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: This fixes an issue where chromium tests cannot be run in macOS.\r\nHence marked as P2 to unblock impeded local development\r\n\r\nRelated sources for later

I cound't find a way to determine when date range selection is completed via calendar selection. This is important for me to know this since I have two sources of date range changes:\r\n- custom header when user clicks on date range preset(dates need to be set according to selected preset which causes unwanted (dateChange) event to be fired on date input)\r\n- regular date range selection using calendar(preset needs to be cleared)\r\n\r\nWhen I use (dateChange) event on matEndDate input like this:\r\n```\r\n    <mat-date-range-input [rangePicker]=\"picker\">\r\n          <input [(ngModel)]=\"startDate\" matStartDate matInput>\r\n          <input [(ngModel)]=\"endDate\" (dateChange)=\"handle($event)\" matEndDate matInput>\r\n    </mat-date-range-input>\r\n```\r\nI noticed the following issues:\r\n\r\n- my IDE(IntelliJ 2020.1) complains about (dateChange) event: `Event dateChange is not emitted by any applicable directives nor by input element `\r\n- dateChange event gets fired twice during date range selection via calendar: first time with null value and second time with the selected value.\r\n\r\nsince dateChange gets fired whenever date input changes no matter where this change comes from I wonder if it is possible to have something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       <mat-date-range-picker #picker (dateRangeSelected)=\"handleDateRangeSelected($event)\">\r\n       </mat-date-range-picker>\r\n```\r\n, where (dateRangeSelected) gets fired when user completes range selection using calendar only?\r\n\r\nCurrenly I subscribe to calendar.selectedChange event and bypass this event through my custom header to workaround this issue.\r\n\r\n2. I do believe that class MatDateRangePicker<D> must support DateRange selection, but currently it allows only single selection which comes from it's parent class:     \r\n```\r\n/** Selects the given date */\r\nselect(date: D): void;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Angular: 9.1.9\r\n- CDK/Material: 10.0.0-rc.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome v83.0.4103.97\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 64bit\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19589","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"help(MatDatePicker): Implementing range date picker with custom header: problems and suggestions\" (#19589)"},{"Id":"637120766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-07T08:47:20","Actor":"bri1990","Number":"19610","RawContent":null,"Title":"Increased initial main.js bundle size in v9 - mainly due to @angular/material packages","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nyes,\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOur initial bundle increased after the upgrade to angular v9.

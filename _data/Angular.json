However, if a standalone directive that is applied to the same element is imported and used, the NG8001 error is not thrown, even though the component itself is not imported.\n\nI expect that the proper behavior should be that the compile-time error occurs regardless of whether a standalone directive is imported. The directive’s presence should not mask the fact that the component is not imported.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ry4zp2n7?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular: 19.0.6\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60837","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Standalone Directive Import Prevents 'is not a known element' Error Even When Standalone Component Is Not Imported\" (#60837)"},{"Id":"2987440814","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-11T03:16:55","Actor":"enriqueperaltamoreno","Number":"60836","RawContent":null,"Title":"La aplicación no compila al ejecutar \"ng serve –open\"","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a bug report or a feature request?\n\n- [x] Bug Report\n- [ ] Feature Request\n\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue [Bug Report only]\n\n1- Estoy trabajando con la versión 19.2.6 de angular\n2- Navego hasta el directorio en que se encuentra el proyecto\n3- Ejecuto el comando \"**ng serve –open**\" para compilar la aplicación\n\n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered [Bug Report only]\n\nSe debería compilar la aplicación\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible [Bug Report only]\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/299b8f6d-6a25-4261-825d-c1b9853406b7)\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw [Bug Report only]\n\n```true\nComponent HMR has been enabled.\n```\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/20.0.0-next.5...20.0.0-next.6)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   Animations are guaranteed to be flushed when Angular\n    runs automatic change detection or manual calls to `ApplicationRef.tick`.\n    Prior to this change, animations would not be flushed in some situations\n    if change detection did not run on any views attached to the\n    application. This change can affect tests which may rely on the old\n    behavior, often by making assertions on DOM elements that should have\n    been removed but weren't because DOM removal is delayed until animations\n    are flushed.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7a971766dc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7a971766dc59691dc68da9439e180a6c4d7b17d8) | feat | add extended diagnostic for uninvoked track function on `@for` blocks ([#&#8203;60495](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60495)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [8744c9a165](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8744c9a165518b77d2037d1255827836326dadf4) | fix | ensure HMR works with different output module type ([#&#8203;60797](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60797)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [4e88e18a8e](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/4e88e18a8ef0f19aed85316e80627ad6d2ec80a7) | feat | mark `toObservable` as stable ([#&#8203;60449](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60449)) |\n| [8d050b5bfc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8d050b5bfc49878f01777f71a37e34d5c1733b1b) | feat | stabilize linkedSignal API ([#&#8203;60741](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60741)) |\n| [866cea9a05](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/866cea9a057ac67fa3f679f1f3da18700926c15a) | feat | Stabilize PendingTasks Injectable ([#&#8203;60716](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60716)) |\n| [39a4e00464](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/39a4e00464465b1e5a7f894d0992254d43f5028f) | fix | fix ng generate [@&#8203;angular/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/core):output-migration.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/compare/v1.25.0...v1.26.0)\n\nBazelisk v1.26.0 comes with several improvements:\n\n### New Features (Go)\n\n-   Implemented option to disable format URL support ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/662](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/662)).\n\n### Bug Fixes & Improvements (Go)\n\n-   Fixed a bug that prevented Bazelisk from being used as a Go dependency via gazelle's `go_deps` extension ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/649](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/649)).\n-   Improved signal handling ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/657](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/657), [https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/658](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/658)).\n-   Improved documentation on how to install Bazelisk on Windows ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/668](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/668)).\n-   Restored debugging symbols in Windows binaries ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/669](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/669)).\n-   Improved `--migrate` mode ([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/678](https://redirect.github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/pull/678)).\n\nWe’d like to thank our amazing contributors

However, there are a few points that could enhance clarity and accessibility:\n\n1. Missing Links in Package Table\nThe package overview table lists several Angular component packages like @angular/cdk, @angular/material, @angular/google-maps, and @angular/youtube-player, but the \"Docs\" column mentions \"Docs\" without providing clickable links to the respective documentation pages. Adding direct URLs would improve usability for developers trying to access documentation quickly.\n\n2. Quick Links Section Improvement\nThe Quick Links section mentions helpful resources like:\n\nDocumentation\n\nDemos and Guides\n\nFAQs\n\nContributing\n\nStackBlitz Template\n\nIt would be more developer-friendly if these were formatted as actual links instead of plain text mentions.\n\n3. Clarification on Browser & Screen Reader Support\nThe current section on supported browsers and screen readers is comprehensive. However, it might help to add a last verified version or date for transparency on how recently these compatibility checks were validated.\n\nSuggested Actions:\nUpdate the documentation table with working links to each package’s docs.\n\nConvert the Quick Links into a bulleted list with actual hyperlinks.\n\nAdd timestamps/version notes on browser and screen reader support.\n\nThis would help improve the onboarding experience for new users and make the documentation more navigable.\n\nThanks for the amazing work on Angular Components!\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nreadme","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30846","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): TITLE Suggestion to Improve Documentation Navigation and Component Package Overview\" (#30846)"},{"Id":"2984263258","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-10T17:11:58","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30839","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move density tokens to their token files","State":"closed","Body":"Removes the `src/material/core/tokens/_density.scss` file that hosted all component density tokens.

One requirement I got was to have the mobile design trigger whenever the Small breakpoint is triggered (not just at XSmall). However, when using the fixedTopGap like in the example given in the docs ([via Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fapp%2Fsidenav-responsive-example.ts)), I found out that the Toolbar switches its height from 64px to 56px when on XSmall.\n\nI'd like to add to the docs of the Toolbar at least some mention of the height-changing behavior. From what I can see, only the Toolbar (of all Angular Material components) has a behavior like this and is thus very different from what I was used to. The only mention of a separate mobile height is in the Styling part of the docs and it only mentions there is a value with that name and how to override it.\n\nAdditionally, I'd add something like the following to the docs of fixedTopGap in Sidenav: \n\"When used with Material Toolbar, the value set here should take into consideration the standard-height and mobile-height difference and when it's applied.\"\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/toolbar/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30829","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): Toolbar doesn't mention responsiveness or how it works with Sidenav\" (#30829)"},{"Id":"2981100243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T22:48:25","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"30828","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/icon): mat-icon misaligned when text-spacing is applied","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30828","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/icon): mat-icon misaligned when text-spacing is applied\" (#30828)"},{"Id":"2977996944","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T20:14:36","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30822","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: merge component token files","State":"closed","Body":"Reduces the number of token files so that each component has just one `m2` and one `m3` token file\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n- Removes support for \"ambiguous tokens\" in the overrides API.

While this works well for typical dialog use cases, there are scenarios where a full-screen dialog would provide a better user experience.\n\nDevelopers currently work around this limitation by:\n- Creating custom full-screen components outside the Dialog system\n- Using CSS hacks to force dialogs to expand beyond their intended size\n- Implementing non-standard patterns that break Material Design guidelines\n\nThese workarounds lead to inconsistent implementations, maintenance overhead, and potential accessibility issues.\n\n#### Proposed Solution\nEnhance the MatDialog service and related components to support a new `fullScreen` configuration option that, when enabled, renders the dialog at 100% width and height of the viewport, with appropriate transitions and behaviors aligned with Material Design principles.\n\n#### References\n- [Material Design Dialog component](https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/overview)\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Complex forms\n- Detail views with rich content or multiple sections\n- Mobile-friendly interfaces\n- Media viewers (images, videos, documents)\n- Workflow wizards with complex steps\n- Rich text editors\n- Content creation interfaces","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30819","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(dialog): Full-screen dialog\" (#30819)"},{"Id":"2976694664","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T12:25:48","Actor":"mistrykaran91","Number":"30818","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/chips): chips form control updating value immediately","State":"open","Body":"Currently, when we have chips with form control, the value is updated only when its focused out.

This makes it extremely easy to introduce concrete dependencies to the test environment and thus break unit test isolation.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd an option to `TestBed.configureTestingModule` that removes root, component, and module providers from consideration. This will force developers to provide mocks (or at least consciously choose concrete implementations) for all dependencies of a component.\r\n\r\nDependencies internal to the framework, such as those used by `effect` will need to be excluded from this restriction as framework functionality does not need to be mocked.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAnother approach would be to add a validation method that no concrete user services have been injected, similar to `HttpTestingController.verfiy`. I feel that putting it upfront rather than a testing assertion is more readable and harder to make a mistake with, but if the implementation of such a method is easier then it is a valid solution to the problem.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57123","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add an option to disallow concrete root providers to be used in TestBed\" (#57123)"},{"Id":"2428588519","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-24T22:46:38","Actor":"9kubczas4","Number":"57122","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing padding for CLI command block in the header of CLI Reference.","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nMissing padding for CLI command block in the header of CLI Reference.\r\n\r\nExample URL:\r\nhttps://angular.dev/cli/build\r\n\r\n<img width=\"598\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b80fe618-6544-4f9a-ae30-64689b15660d\">\r\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/cli/build\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n_No response_\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57122","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing padding for CLI command block in the header of CLI Reference.\" (#57122)"},{"Id":"2428431632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-24T20:38:58","Actor":"atscott","Number":"57121","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): only run matchMedia on server","State":"open","Body":"Use afterNextRender to avoid running matchMedia on the server\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57121","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(docs-infra): only run matchMedia on server\" (#57121)"},{"Id":"2428226580","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-24T18:34:08","Actor":"atscott","Number":"57120","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v18.2.0-next.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57120","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v18.2.0-next.2\" with changelog.\" (#57120)"},{"Id":"2428202232","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-24T18:17:07","Actor":"mvdluit","Number":"57119","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs (docs-infra): add the ability to filter API references on developer preview/experimental","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's not possible to get an overview of all API references marked as developer preview or experimental. \r\n\r\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.dev/api\r\n\r\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could filter the API references based on `status` and not just show/hide `deprecated` items.

This animation module must apply styles that reflect the initial state of the animated element rather than its final state (in our scenario, it should be transparent).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the user will initially see no element.

It is simpler to implement the desired behavior using native CSS animations:\r\n\r\nour css file with desired animation keyframes:\r\n```css\r\n\r\n.fade-in {\r\n  animation: fadeIn 1s ease-in-out;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@keyframes fadeIn {\r\n  0% {\r\n    opacity: 0;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  to {\r\n    opacity: 1;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nour component html file:\r\n```html\r\n\r\n<div class=\"fade-in\" appPauseAnimationOnServer>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nour directive which pauses animation on a server and starts playing it once hydration process is completed:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[appPauseAnimationsOnServer]',\r\n  standalone: true\r\n})\r\nexport class PauseAnimationsOnServerDirective implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor(private el: ElementRef<HTMLElement>,\r\n              @Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object) {\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    if (isPlatformServer(this.platformId)) {\r\n      this.el.nativeElement.style.animationPlayState = 'paused';\r\n    } else {\r\n      this.el.nativeElement.style.animationPlayState = 'running';\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57111","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SSR + animations: animated element must be pre-rendered in its initial state rather than final\" (#57111)"},{"Id":"2427565248","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-24T13:15:11","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"57110","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): add the ability to remove imports from the import manager","State":"open","Body":"Extends the `ImportManager` to allow for imports to be removed.

The code does not take into account the possibility of decleration merging.\r\n\r\nThe project I am working on is using Stencil as a component library. The Stencil Angular output target uses declaration merging in its output which breaks template type checking.

But, I'm facing some runtime issues that I'm not really able to flag as \"internal problems\" or \"angular issues\".  \r\n\r\nSo: either I'm doing something really stupid (then sorry for the waste of time) or there is a bug at angular level. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm mostly inclined to think it's an angular issue related to the usage of \"ng-modules\" / \"zone.js\" and the way esbuild is striping the bundle from unnecessary code as soon as `optimization: true` (default). \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, I've created a simple angular project ([myws](https://github.com/mauriziocescon/myws/tree/master)) that you can fork and play with. It's a tiny and simplified version of what we're doing in our CI/CD. \r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the process:  \r\n- build an ng-element (with ng-modules / zone.js) as an application, \r\n- concatenate the resulting files in one main.js, \r\n- load such files at runtime. \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the repo, the results are the following: \r\n- mf1 (✅): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\"`, `\"buildOptimizer\": true`,\r\n- mf2 (✅): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"`, `\"optimization\": false`,\r\n- mf3 (🚫): built with `\"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\"`, `\"optimization\": true`.\r\n\r\nwhere mf1 / mf2 / mf3 have basically the same code. \r\n\r\nThe runtime error for mf3 is not really helpful: \r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 14 22 59\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/006b6a39-ddad-41d3-ad1d-ab5ae8751e66\">\r\n\r\nLocally, I get different errors for different internal mfs, but I assume the root cause is the same. Some examples: \r\n<img width=\"686\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 13 55 27\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b049a8e2-2689-472d-a80a-2d95c2446a81\">\r\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 13 55 54\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a7771a-8ffb-4541-a3c2-78757b7e1c42\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope there's enough information to the make the ticket actionable on your side! Otherwise, feel free to request whatever makes more sense for you. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot! \r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mauriziocescon/myws/tree/master\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\n18.1.1\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28101","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng-elements(runtime exception): build-angular:application + optimization: true\" (#28101)"},{"Id":"2425724720","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-23T17:24:09","Actor":"sagartalaviya91","Number":"28102","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 18.1.1  is not adding CSP nonce attribute to script tags generated during build(main.ts,polyfills.js etc...)","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI want to implement strict CSP policy for my project, so replaced unsafe-eval and unsafe-inline with nonce-dynamicnonce.\r\nBut Angular version 18.1.1 is not adding nonce to script tags of main.js, polyfills.js etc. \r\nBecause of that it is considering this scripts tags as unsafe and browser is blocking its execution.\r\nIn below stackblitz I used 18.1.1 and added nonce using CSP_NONCE and ngCspNonce.

Clone the [angular cli repository](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). \r\n2. Run `yarn build --local`\r\n3. Open the dist folder and extract _angular_cli.tgz (Using this as an example you can look for any other tgz file in dist)\r\n4. Open the `package.json` file\r\n5. Look for `@angular-devkit/architect` (Using this as an example)\r\n6. You will observe that the path to the file is something like: `<path>\\packages\\angular_devkit\\npm_package_archive.tgz`\r\n7. The same thing can be observerd in many places in this package.json file, and in other package.json files of other generated `<package>.tgz`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nExpected path(using `@angular-devkit/architect` as an example) should be `<path>/packages\\angular_devkit\\architect\\npm_package_archive.tgz` \r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the new behavior that. -->\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n- [x] Maybe(As it is chaning the package.json files for local builds)\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be in `link_package_json_to_tarballs.bzl` file where an unnecessary `dirname ` in line 56 is used ( this is resulting in `parent of parent dir` instead of just having `parent dir`). It is executing a statement like `(  dirname (<path>\\packages\\angular_devkit\\architect)    )/npm_package_archive.tgz` which is resulting in TAR to have an incorrect value like

The thing is I'm using web workers in my Angular app, and I have found some issues while deploying it.\r\n\r\nIn my service, I'm importing the web worker as the Angular doc says.\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\nthis.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url), \r\n   {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nduring development (`ng serve`) it works as expected. \r\n\r\nBut when I build, I see in my dist folder a new file called `worker-<HASH>`\r\nI'm building with @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild using this command:\r\n- `ng build --configuration=production --deploy-url \"https://${CLOUDFRONT_URL}/${VERSION}\"`\r\n\r\nCLOUDFRONT_URL is the URL of my AWS CDN.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is, that I'm not able to locate the file. Because \"import.meta.url\" is not the current URL I'm using for the web page.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n- Lets say that my page is hosted at www.mypage.com\r\n- My files are hosted on a cloudfront cdn, thus, files lives on s3, and I'm able to download it using the CLOUDFRONT_URL mentioned above. (that's why I'm using the --deploy-url param)\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I noted is that, when I do something like this:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\n// my typescript code\r\n\r\nif(environment.name === 'development'){\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url),\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n     )\r\n} else {\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', 'https://mypage.com')\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nits gets transpiled to something like this:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\nif(environment.name === 'development'){\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('worker-F4AB9Z', import.meta.url),\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n     )\r\n} else {\r\n    this.worker = new Worker(new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', 'https://mypage.com')\r\n        {name: 'worker', type: 'module'}\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that Esbuild replaced the `../utils/workers/myworker.worker` with the compiled filename `worker-F4AB9Z`.\r\nBut it is not doing the same with any string other than \"import.meta.url\" for the URL of the new worker.\r\n\r\nIf I try to do something like\r\n``` typescript\r\nconst url = new URL('../utils/workers/myworker.worker', import.meta.url)\r\n```\r\nI wont work. Esbuild will only replace the file path with the compiled filename if I put the `new URL( ... )` inside the Worker constructor. Is that expected?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.3.8\r\nNode: 20.9.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 10.7.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                    16.2.14\r\n@angular/cli                    17.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.8\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.6\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAnother question: Is there any way that I could have the output filename ( the `worker-F4AB9Z` ) in a variable? \r\nBecause currently I'm manually deploying the web worker to s3 and hardcoding the URL in the code.\r\nBut as you may know, the hash of the file changes on every deploy, or at least when the worker code changes.

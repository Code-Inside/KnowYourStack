This ensures that Angular never itself\r\nintroduces an import which creates a cycle.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if the cycle already exists in the user's program, though, is a\r\nbit different. In these cases, the \"correct\" emit for Angular is to generate\r\nthe component scope (whether direct or remote) inside of a closure, to\r\nprevent evaluating the scope's references until module evaluation is\r\ncomplete and all cyclic imports have been resolved. We don't want to do this\r\nfor *all* scopes because the code size cost of emitting a function wrapper\r\nis non-zero.\r\n\r\nIn this fix, we take the presence of a `forwardRef` in a component's\r\n`imports` or in an NgModule `declarations` or `imports` as a sign that\r\ncomponent scopes emitted into those files need to be protected against\r\ncyclic references. In a future commit, we may introduce a warning or error\r\nif cyclic imports are not protected behind `forwardRef` in these cases, but\r\nthis will take some time to implement.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/46139","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(compiler-cli): preserve `forwardRef` for component scopes\" (#46139)"},{"Id":"1250161586","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-26T22:49:14","Actor":"atscott","Number":"46161","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler): Add extended diagnostic to warn when text attributes …","State":"open","Body":"…are intended to be bindings\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/attribute-binding#attribute-class-and-style-bindings\r\n\r\nAngular supports `attr.`, `style.`, and `class.` binding prefixes to\r\nbind attributes, styles, and classes.

Currently, you would either use a function or a pipe to map the data to a URL. For example, images representing items in a list view for fruits available at a supermarket. I know that, for the inputs, this function will always return the same URL for the fruit in question. An apple will always show an apple, a banana will be a banana, and same with a cherry. Currently, there doesn't seem to be a way to tell the change detector that it will always be the same based on inputs. Or, say, it's depending on internal values on a class. Let the change detection know it's directly correlated to certain inputs.\r\n\r\nAs a code example, I have the following class:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class Fruit {\r\n  fruit: string\r\n  idFruit: number\r\n\r\n  getFruitUrl() {\r\n    // get me a pic of my fruit based on idFruit\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo use this in a component to render the output of `transformResultToBeHumanReadable`, you would either need to use a pipe that triggers the function, trigger this in a change event and cache the results on the component, or, use the function in the template, at the expense of being rendered multiple times. For multiple little things like this, you end up having to create multiple pipes or variables to cache the data. A declaration either via a function decorator or extended in the component decorator could potentially provide the update cycle with the knowledge of where the function updates, in order to not have to always update.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a set of directives that allow functions to be recognised similar to pipes in terms of update cycle. There could even be bindings to tie update state to individual variables on the class.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class Fruit {\r\n  fruit: string\r\n  idFruit: number\r\n\r\n  @PureFunction({changesOn: [this.idFruit]})\r\n  getFruitUrl() {\r\n    // Only relies on idFruit, so only called when idFruit updates\r\n  }\r\n\r\n @PureFunction()\r\n  getFruitUrl(input: any) {\r\n    // Only relies on input, so only changes if the values being input are different.\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @PureFunction({changesOn: [this.idFruit]})\r\n  getFruitUrl(large?: boolean) {\r\n    // Only relies on both class variables and input variables, so changes when they do.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor add declarations for the functions in the component declaration.\r\n```TypeScript\r\n@Component({\r\n  pureFunctions: [\r\n    {name: \"myFunc\", changesOn: [\"result\"]}\r\n  ]\r\n}) class ObjComponent {\r\n  result;\r\n  myFunc() {\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWhile pipes were designed for this, excessive small pipes that are only needed in one or two places might not be as useful if we can just apply the pipe's change detection strategies to the function. An extension ChangeDetectionStrategy could be used to improve detecting changes if hints are given about how some functions handle change. Again, with the fruit idea, if it relies on only its inputs, and has an output that directly correlates to the input, and won't change its value outside of change detection, like an impure pipe, then it could be able to be considered like a pure Pipe.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46135","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Decorator for class functions to act like pure pipes in

If you don't provide a PAT token, Scorecards will use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` available in the workflow. Due to limitations of the permissions model and GitHub APIs, be aware of the following limitations:\n\n1.  Without a PAT, the Branch-Protection is not supported, so it will be disabled. You will not receive alerts for this check.\n2.  Scorecards only supports PAT on private repositories. If you want to install Scorecards on a private repository, you still need to use a PAT.\n\nFor more information, visit the [README.md](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/tree/v1.1.0#readme)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;rohankh532](https://togithub.com/rohankh532) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112)\n-   [@&#8203;justaugustus](https://togithub.com/justaugustus) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126)\n-   [@&#8203;jamietanna](https://togithub.com/jamietanna) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145)\n-   [@&#8203;jonasbb](https://togithub.com/jonasbb) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129)\n-   [@&#8203;azeemshaikh38](https://togithub.com/azeemshaikh38) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247](https://togithub.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/compare/v1.0.4...v1.1.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

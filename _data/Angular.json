The test passes even before the fix because the `ngc` binary and end-to-end tests [don't request diagnostics unless the configuration is considered valid](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/ed21f5c75378e1ce717ee3d76d28c8c994209de1/packages/compiler-cli/src/perform_compile.ts#L292-L293).

In that situation, it might be the case that the chunk of code they are trying to load is no longer present.\r\n\r\nWorking against this is that, while some code was deployed on the day the error below was reported, no changes at all were made to the angular front end that day--it would have recompiled as part of the deploy, but I'm not sure any of the filenames would have changed.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause of the chunk failing to load, it seems that there could be some more graceful way to handle such failures.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction

There are no build errors in the console, and weirdly after a few incremental rebuilds the problem fixes itself. After some digging I found the root cause was this PR: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22239 If I disable the `NamedChunksPlugin` in the webpack config, then the problem goes away and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nReproducing this outside of our app is hard. If you're willing to sign an NDA I can just give you access to the repo to debug it yourselves, or if you can give me some instructions on how to debug it my end to find the root cause I'm also happy to do that.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk default-libs_comment_common_src_lib_comments_comment_module_ts-libs_task_comment-bar_src_lib_-ca5e7c failed.\r\n(error: http://localhost:4200/default-libs_comment_common_src_lib_comments_comment_module_ts-libs_task_comment-bar_src_lib_-ca5e7c.js)\r\nChunkLoadError: Loading chunk default-libs_comment_common_src_lib_comments_comment_module_ts-libs_task_comment-bar_src_lib_-ca5e7c failed.\r\n(error: http://localhost:4200/default-libs_comment_common_src_lib_comments_comment_module_ts-libs_task_comment-bar_src_lib_-ca5e7c.js)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 13.1.3\r\nNode: 16.13.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 6.14.15\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 13.1.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\r\n... forms, language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1301.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.1.2\r\n@angular/cdk                    13.1.1\r\n@angular/cli                    13.1.3\r\n@angular/google-maps            12.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             13.1.3\r\nng-packagr                      13.1.2\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.5.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Now we cannot, or the option changed and it is nowhere told how to do so.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nScenario is very simple. Application has 15+ languages and I need to serve a specific language, in my example: German. I can't anymore because it says that this is not a valid option.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nCreate an application with two locales and try to launch the one which is not set as default. It seems it's not possible anymore.\r\n\r\nIt used to be possible using this command: `ng serve --configuration=de`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"de\": {\r\n  \"i18nFile\": \"src/i18n/messages.de.xlf\", <-- ERROR since v13\r\n  \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\", <-- ERROR since v13\r\n  \"i18nLocale\": \"de\" <-- ERROR since v13\r\n}\r\n...\r\n\"de\": {\r\n  \"browserTarget\": \"frontend:build:de\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre>Data path \"\" must NOT have additional properties(i18nFile)<code>\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nBuild fails and application is not served. Since I see squiggly lines over all three options it is clear that all of them are not valid anymore.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 13.1.3\r\nNode: 16.13.2\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.1.2\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.1301.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/core         13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/angular          13.1.3 (cli-only)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

concept of \"global\" scope in Angular templates; Unless the function is defined on the component, it's inaccessible. \r\n\r\nIf `@NgModule` had a way to ambiently declare a function accessible to the

That could cause any package scripts which used the `esbuild` command to no longer work. This release fixes the regression so `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` should now be present again after installation. This regression only affected people installing esbuild using `npm` with either the `--omit=optional` or `--no-optional` flag, which is a somewhat unusual situation.\n\n    **More details:**\n\n    The reason for this regression is due to some obscure npm implementation details. Since the Go compiler doesn't support trivial cross-compiling on certain Android platforms, esbuild's installer installs a WebAssembly shim on those platforms instead. In the previous release I attempted to simplify esbuild's WebAssembly shims to depend on the `esbuild-wasm` package instead of including another whole copy of the WebAssembly binary (to make publishing faster and to save on file system space after installation). However, both the `esbuild` package and the `esbuild-wasm` package provide a binary called `esbuild` and it turns out that adding `esbuild-wasm` as a nested dependency of the `esbuild` package (specifically `esbuild` optionally depends on `@esbuild/android-arm` which depends on `esbuild-wasm`) caused npm to be confused about what `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` is supposed to be.\n\n    It's pretty strange and unexpected that disabling the installation of optional dependencies altogether would suddenly cause an optional dependency's dependency to conflict with the top-level package. What happens under the hood is that if `--omit=optional` is present, npm attempts to uninstall the `esbuild-wasm` nested dependency at the end of `npm install` (even though the `esbuild-wasm` package was never installed due to `--omit=optional`). This uninstallation causes `node_modules/.bin/esbuild` to be deleted.\n\n    After doing a full investigation, I discovered that npm's handling of the `.bin` directory is deliberately very brittle. When multiple packages in the dependency tree put something in `.bin` with the same name, the end result is non-deterministic/random. What you get in `.bin` might be from one package, from the other package, or might be missing entirely. The workaround suggested by npm is to just avoid having two packages that put something in `.bin` with the same name. So this was fixed by making the `@esbuild/android-arm` and `esbuild-android-64` packages each include another whole copy of the WebAssembly binary, which works because these packages don't put anything in `.bin`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint</summary>\n\n### [`v8.24.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.24.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.23.1...v8.24.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`1729f9e`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/1729f9ea4d7b2945b2b701d72027fd4aace954cf) feat: account for `sourceType: \"commonjs\"` in the strict rule ([#&#8203;16308](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16308)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`b0d72c9`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/b0d72c96b2a9cde7a5798c2b08ec4e70683c6aca) feat: add rule logical-assignment-operators ([#&#8203;16102](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16102)) (fnx)\n-   [`f02bcd9`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f02bcd91bf89b6c167d5346a36677fdb854f0c05) feat: `array-callback-return` support `findLast` and `findLastIndex` ([#&#8203;16314](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16314)) (Sosuke Suzuki)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`2c152ff`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/2c152ff0fb709b99e62c19ecd2c95689efacbe4c) docs: note false positive `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` in prefer-reflect ([#&#8203;16317](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16317)) (AnnAngela)\n-   [`bf7bd88`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/bf7bd885a92046a6b6bcbcaaa1e78e9f2c4b482f) docs: fix warn severity description for new config files ([#&#8203;16324](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16324)) (Nitin Kumar)\n-   [`8cc0bbe`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/8cc0bbe440dc5e6af6ef02f00d0514a40ca07c24) docs: use more clean link syntax ([#&#8203;16309](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16309)) (Percy Ma)\n-   [`6ba269e`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/6ba269ed673f965d081287b769c12beeb5f98887) docs: fix typo ([#&#8203;16288](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16288)) (jjangga0214)\n\n#### Chores\n\n-   [`131e646`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/131e646e227b9aca3937fe287343bf2c3df408af) chore: Upgrade [@&#8203;humanwhocodes/config-array](https://togithub.com/humanwhocodes/config-array) for perf ([#&#8203;16339](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16339)) (Nicholas C.

Either explicitly write `$a - $b` or `$a (-$b)`. See\n    https://sass-lang.com/d/strict-unary for more details.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add an optional `argumentName` parameter to `SassScriptException()` to make it\n    easier to throw exceptions associated with particular argument names.\n\n-   Most APIs that previously returned `num` now return `double`. All APIs\n    continue to *accept* `num`, although in Dart 2.0.0 these APIs will be changed\n    to accept only `double`.\n\n##### JS API\n\n-   Fix a bug in which certain warning spans would not have their properties\n    accessible by the JS API.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Therefore, we opt-out from using upcoming ECMA runtime behavior to better support the ECO system and libraries that depend on the non spec compliant output.

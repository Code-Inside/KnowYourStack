Our software have a currently productive version which is running Angular 15 (I'll refer to this branch as \"support\" from now). Our next version, planned to be released around april, is upgraded to Angular 16, and this branch build (called \"dev\" branch) is running fine as of now.\r\n\r\nOur support branch did not have any commits since a week so I can exclude a code change being the source of the break. Last week our nightly builds were completely fine. Since this morning, they fail.\r\n\r\nAs long as a developer does not remove their \"node_modules\" from the project, they can build the software fine. As soon as they delete the folder and run `npm install` again (I ran this process on my personal laptop today), they are stuck and cannot perform any of these : \r\n - npm run start\r\n - npm run test\r\n - npm run build\r\n\r\nIt seems a transitive dependency of something was updated and broke our builds. But what I cannot say, the error message is completely obscure.\r\n\r\nHere is my complete `package.json` file : \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"XXXX\",\r\n  \"version\": \"YYY.30.0\",\r\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\r\n    \"start\": \"ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build --configuration production --base-href /frontend/\",\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test --browsers Chrome\",\r\n    \"test-ci\": \"ng test --watch=false --browsers ChromeHeadless\",\r\n    \"test-cc\": \"ng test --watch=false --browsers ChromeHeadless --code-coverage --source-map\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"15.2.9\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/material\": \"15.2.9\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@auth0/angular-jwt\": \"5.1.2\",\r\n    \"@ngx-translate/core\": \"14.0.0\",\r\n    \"@ngx-translate/http-loader\": \"7.0.0\",\r\n    \"ch-plate-lib\": \"YYY.10.1\", // an internal Angular library\r\n    \"class-transformer\": \"0.5.1\",\r\n    \"file-saver\": \"2.0.5\",\r\n    \"ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\": \"15.2.2\",\r\n    \"ngx-mask\": \"15.1.0\",\r\n    \"reflect-metadata\": \"0.1.13\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"7.5.7\",\r\n    \"tslib\": \"2.4.1\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.12.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"15.2.10\",\r\n    \"@types/file-saver\": \"2.0.5\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"4.3.1\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"4.5.0\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"6.4.1\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"3.1.1\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage\": \"2.2.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"5.1.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"ncp\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"4.8.4\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAny help or idea would be highly appreciated.

onStable() emit in the next microtask","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nPlease consider modifying the default NoopZone implementation.\r\n\r\nRight now, if some code uses Zone.onStable() or Zone.onMicrotaskEmpty(), it will not work in a zoneless Angular app.\r\n\r\nBut if onStable() and onMicrotaskEmpty() implementations will emit in setTimeout(), everything works great.\r\nHere you can find the demo:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-sbyvuz?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nIn that demo, you can see that with the default noop zone implementation, when you move the pointer over buttons, tooltips are not displayed, and toasts are not displayed when you click a button.\r\n\r\nBut if you use custom implementation (uncomment line 31 and comment 30), everything works fine.\r\n\r\nNG Bootstrap is not the only library that uses Zone.onStable(), I believe there is a lot of code that does, and there is nothing wrong with it (it's not a bug of NG Bootstrap or other libraries and apps).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nHere is the code that demonstrates the idea:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { type EnvironmentProviders, EventEmitter, NgZone, ɵprovideZonelessChangeDetection } from \"@angular/core\";\r\nimport { ReplaySubject } from \"rxjs\";\r\n\r\nclass ReplayEmitter<T> extends ReplaySubject<T> {\r\n  emit(v: T) {\r\n    this.next(v);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  constructor(_isAsync?: boolean) {\r\n    super(1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class NoopNgZoneX implements NgZone {\r\n  readonly hasPendingMicrotasks = false;\r\n  readonly hasPendingMacrotasks = false;\r\n  readonly isStable = true;\r\n  readonly onUnstable = new EventEmitter<any>();\r\n\r\n  get onMicrotaskEmpty() {\r\n    const e = new ReplayEmitter<any>();\r\n    setTimeout(() => e.next(null));\r\n    return e as unknown as EventEmitter<any>;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get onStable() {\r\n    const e = new ReplayEmitter<any>();\r\n    setTimeout(() => e.next(null));\r\n    return e as unknown as EventEmitter<any>;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  readonly onError = new EventEmitter<any>();\r\n\r\n  run<T>(fn: (...args: any[]) => T, applyThis?: any, applyArgs?: any): T {\r\n    return fn.apply(applyThis, applyArgs);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  runGuarded<T>(\r\n    fn: (...args: any[]) => any,\r\n    applyThis?: any,\r\n    applyArgs?: any\r\n  ): T {\r\n    return fn.apply(applyThis, applyArgs);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  runOutsideAngular<T>(fn: (...args: any[]) => T): T {\r\n    return fn();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  runTask<T>(\r\n    fn: (...args: any[]) => T,\r\n    applyThis?: any,\r\n    applyArgs?: any,\r\n    _name?: string\r\n  ): T {\r\n    return fn.apply(applyThis, applyArgs);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI took the code of `NoopNgZone` from the source code of Angular, and modified 2 fields (`onMicrotaskEmpty`, `onStable`), everything else left as is.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI tried to emit synchronously (works only for a few cases), and tried to emit in `Promise.resolve()` (doesn't work well for every case). `setTimeout()` works great for every case.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54126","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue

Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.19.12...v0.20.0)\n\n**This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.** To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `^0.19.0` or `~0.19.0`. See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\nThis time there is only one breaking change, and it only matters for people using Deno. Deno tests that use esbuild will now fail unless you make the change described below.\n\n-   Work around API deprecations in Deno 1.40.x ([#&#8203;3609](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3609), [#&#8203;3611](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3611))\n\n    [Deno 1.40.0](https://deno.com/blog/v1.40) was just released and introduced run-time warnings about certain APIs that esbuild uses. With this release, esbuild will work around these run-time warnings by using newer APIs if they are present and falling back to the original APIs otherwise. This should avoid the warnings without breaking compatibility with older versions of Deno.\n\n    Unfortunately, doing this introduces a breaking change. The newer child process APIs lack a way to synchronously terminate esbuild's child process, so calling `esbuild.stop()` from within a Deno test is no longer sufficient to prevent Deno from failing a test that uses esbuild's API (Deno fails tests that create a child process without killing it before the test ends). To work around this, esbuild's `stop()` function has been changed to return a promise, and you now have to change `esbuild.stop()` to `await esbuild.stop()` in all of your Deno tests.\n\n-   Reorder implicit file extensions within `node_modules` ([#&#8203;3341](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3341), [#&#8203;3608](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3608))\n\n    In [version 0.18.0](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/v0.18.0), esbuild changed the behavior of implicit file extensions within `node_modules` directories (i.e. in published packages) to prefer `.js` over `.ts` even when the `--resolve-extensions=` order prefers `.ts` over `.js` (which it does by default). However, doing that also accidentally made esbuild prefer `.css` over `.ts`, which caused problems for people that published packages containing both TypeScript and CSS in files with the same name.\n\n    With this release, esbuild will reorder TypeScript file extensions immediately after the last JavaScript file extensions in the implicit file extension order instead of putting them at the end of the order. Specifically the default implicit file extension order is `.tsx,.ts,.jsx,.js,.css,.json` which used to become `.jsx,.js,.css,.json,.tsx,.ts` in `node_modules` directories. With this release it will now become `.jsx,.js,.tsx,.ts,.css,.json` instead.\n\n    Why even rewrite the implicit file extension order at all? One reason is because the `.js` file is more likely to behave correctly than the `.ts` file. The behavior of the `.ts` file  may depend on `tsconfig.json` and the `tsconfig.json` file may not even be published, or may use `extends` to refer to a base `tsconfig.json` file that wasn't published. People can get into this situation when they forget to add all `.ts` files to their `.npmignore` file before publishing to npm. Picking `.js` over `.ts` helps make it more likely that resulting bundle will behave correctly.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>typicode/husky (husky)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.0.7`](https://togithub.com/typicode/husky/releases/tag/v9.0.7)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/typicode/husky/compare/v9.0.6...v9.0.7)\n\n-   fix: typo and source `~/.huskyrc` correctly (compatibility with v8)\n-   docs: fix example by [@&#8203;typicode](https://togithub.com/typicode) in [https://github.com/typicode/husky/pull/1363](https://togithub.com/typicode/husky/pull/1363)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js (inquirer)</summary>\n\n### [`v9.2.13`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.12...inquirer@9.2.13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@9.2.12...inquirer@9.2.13)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.5.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v6.5.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.4.0...v6.5.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   build(deps-dev): bump jsdom from 23.2.0 to 24.0.0 by [@&#8203;dependabot](https://togithub.com/dependabot) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2632](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2632)\n-   feat: Implement EventSource by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2608](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2608)\n-   fix: readable body by [@&#8203;ronag](https://togithub.com/ronag) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2642](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2642)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.4.0...v6.5.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

We still allow the user to select what tertiary color to pair with their primary, since the spec doesn't make the same sort of assumptions about the tertiary color.\r\n\r\nNote: because our demo targets styles at the .mat-primary, .mat-accent, .mat-error classes, it winds up overriding the default color combo that users would see out of the box for the mat-select (a primary form-field with a secondary selected option). This is one example where the M2 color=\"primary/accent/warn\" API doesn't quite align with how colors work in M3. We do not expect users to apply colors in this way, and we probably shouldn't do it in our demo either.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nThe rxjs-interop `toObservable` function only accepts `Signal` as an input. The way it is implemented allow any reactive function (function that reads signals) to be accepted, as it uses `effect`. \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nAllow for any reactive function to be passed, and not just a `Signal`. This allows for more flexibility and could be useful in many situations. \r\nFor example - utility functions might return a static value (not a signal) but read signals. That make these functions \"reactive\", so you can use `effect` (or `toObservable`) to listen to their changes.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is a workaround for this from the consumer side, which is to use `computed` before calling `toObservable`. However - I think it is less ideal because it creates unnecessary code which hurts readability, and it creates an unnecessary node in the reactive tree.

I also want to use WorkBox and not angular-serviceworker. This conflicts, for in order to compile my WorkBox template and inject built files into it it requires a second build step to be performed after angular has done emitting files to the output directory. I managed to get something like this working using a custom webpack configuration, but with angular 17 we are moving away from webpack and over to esbuild, and this customization is no longer available. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIn the angular.json config, a `serviceWorker` is either missing or declared as a pointer to an angular-serviceworker json config. \r\nI haven't thought this fully through yet, but something like the following config would be nice:\r\n```\r\n\"targets\": {\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"serviceWorker\": {\r\n        \"path\": \"./sw.ts\",\r\n        \"builder\": \"./path/to/buildScript.js\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe alternative is to give up HMR and `ng serve` completely, build angular first, then build and injectManifest into service worker and then run the entire project through a local http-server.

See https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25434#issuecomment-1610298235 for more context.\r\n\r\nIf hiding the Jest configuration is a challenge for you, please consider if an alternative approach _without_ hooking into the Jest config is reasonable. Otherwise please post your use case to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25434 so we can evaluate the best path forward for this feature.\r\n\r\nJest was incorrectly picking up custom configurations, even though they exist outside Jest's root directory. This commit fixes that behavior so Jest does not see user configurations and does not apply them. Ideally we would throw an error if a Jest configuration is found to be more clear that it isn't doing what developers expect. However they may use a Jest config to run other projects in the same workspace outside of Angular CLI and we don't want to prevent that. A warning seems like the best trade off of notifying users that a custom config isn't supported while also not preventing unrelated Jest usage in the same workspace.\r\n\r\nI've noticed a few issues where users were using a custom config either causing a problem or attempting to solve one. I want to be up front during the experimentation process what our current stance is for users playing around with Jest so we can collect feedback on how it impacts users earlier.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26852","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix: ignore custom Jest configuration file and warn if one is found\" (#26852)"},{"Id":"2076977515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-11T15:51:04","Actor":"spock123","Number":"26851","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow extract-i18n to only add i18n tags that do not already exist in target translation file","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs it is now, running extract-i18n is pretty much useless, because once it's run, any consecutive runs will overwrite the translation file entries.\r\n\r\nThis means, that once run, any new translation tokens added to the project will have to be manually added to all translation files. \r\n\r\nOur use case: we are adding translations to a large site, with 5-8 languages. \r\nThe translation of the project will be a long process, and we cannot add tags to the entire project in one swift move. We have to take it step by step.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to the way extract-i18n works, we cannot use it, as it will just write all i18n tokens found in the code, to the target file.\r\n\r\nFWIW, we are using translation files with the JSON format.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd a setting to extract-i18n (for example --no-override ) so that it will not override already existing entries for that ID.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n A) https://github.com/daniel-sc/ng-extract-i18n-merge\r\n\r\nPoorly maintained, and only supports XLIFF format.\r\n\r\nB) write own script that picks out the translations and adds them to the current translation files (would only work with json). \r\n\r\nC) use other 3rd party runtime translation libraries but we don't want that - we want compile time , as it's much better imho.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26851","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow extract-i18n to only add i18n tags that do not already exist in target translation file\" (#26851)"},{"Id":"2076735056","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-11T14:15:17","Actor":"MattiJarvinen","Number":"26850","RawContent":null,"Title":"Multiple projects in Angular workspace don't get tested by running ng test without a project name","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\ntest\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nIt's been a while but this is a documented feature... :(\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs per documentation https://angular.io/cli/test\r\n\r\nng test [project]\r\nng t [project]\r\n\r\nTakes the name of the project, as specified in the projects section of the angular.json workspace configuration file.

was\n\n15.1\n\n### Description\n\nI have a table with 12 columns defined that I am defining CSS using .scss files.\r\nTwo of the columns have CSS that is not showing up in the compiled app.\r\n\r\n.mat-column-description and .mat-column-status-field css definitions are not showing up in rendered page\r\nwhile the 10 others do show up when defining .mat-column-{columnName}\r\n\r\nI do see the .mat-column-description and mat-column-status-field classes in the dev console, but there is no corresponding style entries.\r\n\r\nFor instance a column that works has:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.mat-column-arrowKey[_ngcontent-ng-cli-universal-c1662717251] {\r\n    white-space: pre;\r\n    min-width: 100px;\r\n    max-width: 100px;\r\n    background-color: khaki;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut there is no such entries for .mat-column-description or mat-column-status-field...\r\n\r\nIt is annoying, because the description and status-field columns are collapsing if the browser is made narrow, rather than staying at a minimum width.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```\r\n  public displayedColumns: string[] = [\r\n    'actions', 'arrowKey', 'fromLocation', 'toLocation',

I posted on stackoverflow and it was suggested this is a bug that I should post here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class HeaderComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  authService = inject(AuthService)\r\n\r\n  isLoggedIn$ = new BehaviorSubject<Boolean>(false);\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    console.log('IS INIT');\r\n    this.authService.authStatus().pipe(\r\n      tap( console.log ),\r\n      tap( res => {\r\n          this.isLoggedIn$.next(!!res?.body)\r\n      } )\r\n    ).subscribe(\r\n      () => {},\r\n      ( err ) => {\r\n        console.log( err );\r\n        this.isLoggedIn$.next( false );\r\n      }\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  authStatus(): Observable<HttpResponse<object>> {\r\n    return this.http.get(`${apiUrls.authServiceApi}/status`,\r\n      { observe: 'response', withCredentials: true });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen in the template:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n   <ng-container *ngIf=\"!(isLoggedIn$ | async)\">\r\n      <span\r\n        [routerLink]=\"['/login']\"\r\n        routerLinkActive=\"router-link-active\"\r\n        class=\"text-xl cursor-pointer text-gray-200 font-bold m-3 hover:underline hover:text-indigo-200\"\r\n        >Login</span\r\n      >\r\n      <span\r\n        [routerLink]=\"['/register']\"\r\n        routerLinkActive=\"router-link-active\"\r\n        class=\"text-xl cursor-pointer text-gray-200 font-bold m-3 hover:underline hover:text-indigo-200\"\r\n        >Register</span\r\n      >\r\n    </ng-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the header template is not immediately updated on logging in (logging in correctly saves an httponly cookie, then used to poke the api through the header component). it's only updated after a page refresh to hide the login/register links.\r\n\r\nstackoverflow link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78096543/monitoring-api-response-from-angular/78099204\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 17.2.2\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.21\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.2.2\r\n@angular/cli                    17.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular             17.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54686","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unable to react to an API response.\" (#54686)"},{"Id":"2167528978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-04T18:57:20","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"54694","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: use the right path for first-app images","State":"open","Body":"Before : https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app\r\nAfter : https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-54694-adev-prev-dtghxpbl.web.app/tutorials/first-app\r\n\r\nNotice the image in `Conceptual preview of your first Angular app` was missing.

I have recently migrated to OnPush, and found that setting properties directly on the input (`component.myInput = newValue; fixture.detectChanges()`) does not trigger change detection. Instead, I found two alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. `fixture.componentRef.setInput('myInput', newValue)`\r\n2. `component.myInput = newValue; fixture.changeDetectorRef.markForCheck(); fixture.detectChanges()`.\r\n\r\n№ 2 adds boilerplate, and will not work with signals. Therefore № 1 is preferable. However, it does not offer any typesafety.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe following type signature for setInput:\r\n\r\n``` ts\r\nabstract class ComponentRef<C> {\r\n  abstract setInput<K extends MutableKeys<C>>(name: K, value: C[K]): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype MutableKeys<T> = {\r\n  [P in keyof T]-?: \r\n    // Check if trying to assign a value to the property P after it's been initialized\r\n    // does not result in a type error (indicating it's mutable). If it's mutable, include the key P.\r\n    // We use a conditional type here, where we try to assign a different type to the property P\r\n    // and check if it's assignable to the original type T. If it is, it means the property is mutable.\r\n    IfEquals<{ [Q in P]: T[P] }, { -readonly [Q in P]: T[P] }, P>\r\n}[keyof T];\r\n\r\n// Utility type to check if two types are exactly the same\r\ntype IfEquals<X, Y, A = X, B = never> = \r\n  (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends \r\n  (<T>() => T extends Y ? 1 : 2) ? A : B;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample usage:\r\n```ts\r\nclass X {\r\n  readonly a = 1;\r\n  b = 2;\r\n  c?: number;\r\n  protected d = 4;\r\n  private e = 5;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare let componentRef: ComponentRef<X>;\r\n\r\n// @ts-expect-error - a is readonly\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"a\", 1);\r\n\r\n// b is mutable\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"b\", 2);\r\n\r\n// c is mutable and optional\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"c\", 3);\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"c\", undefined);\r\n\r\n// @ts-expect-error - d is protected\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"d\", 4);\r\n\r\n// @ts-expect-error - e is protected\r\ncomponentRef.setInput(\"e\", 5);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Typescript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?ssl=10&ssc=1&pln=12&pc=1#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-Jh0hPJRbQwZ8EAaBAAEYEBsAAmGCFEQ1QEHAyDTBgrI4IQlQMDfVCMKwhBcNo78bH-WcOBQV0EBQtgM2bVsL3mHJ0NnLgQCA7CRKQJpgPEXBLigST4yUeBXi+ICABZFN9ZwlDkICAFZZyiOd2AZDjj20RBBQIYh9SoagbBwGzSHIeyXwYNj2E+AABCAwDqBR4ngALYR9BA6ghZMED44h23YvBCBcygaAJQQRDESQTAAImALKHHQ3xPM+MSoopFJ4ucuyUrS0QJAgbKQDyhjCuiLzOlgcNsVTBIbTtLYRXMZAKsSqrqFSoRasyrLYCagBmFr2GskbXOqiaMvq6amvEW0aBKV4FvnTpfP8wLeggEK4XCtSoqUs7XmG2yVrGmr1uy5QmvUg62oQY6AvkILzphS6IoSG7NmUpQ3kWhLHuS561rq7KSCa-TCqAA)\r\n\r\nOpen points:\r\n\r\n1. support for signals\r\n2. support for aliasing (though it would be acceptable for me to pass the property name rather than the alias)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n`component.myInput = newValue; fixture.changeDetectorRef.markForCheck(); fixture.detectChanges()`\r\n\r\n- no support for signals\r\n- extra boilerplate","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54693","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Provide typesafety for ComponentRef.setInput\" (#54693)"},{"Id":"2167281038","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-04T16:42:51","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"54691","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CLI help contents.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54691","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]\" (#54691)"},{"Id":"2167084447","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-04T15:12:08","Actor":"anthonn","Number":"54690","RawContent":null,"Title":"Animation in not active material mat-tab makes animated element get stuck in the DOM","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nanimations\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nIf triggering an animation for a component that is currently in an inactive `mat-tab`, that animation sticks to the DOM and is not removed as it should.\r\n\r\nSee the attached stackblitz.\r\n\r\n1.

This works fine if the user navigates by keyboard, and if the user try to go outside the dialog because the backdrop capture mouse clicks. But if the user goes to the browser chrome, like the URL bar, and then navigates with the keyboard to the page content, the focus is transferred to elements behind the dialog, making the dialog ineffective.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug in the dialog implementation because I display another kind of dialogs, using a custom CDK's Overlay and ConfigurableFocusTrapFactory and it can capture this kind of navigation, so this bug doesn't look like part of the focus trap implementation.\r\n\r\nThis is what I do that works fine on my custom dialog based on CDK's Overlay:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nconst focusTrap = this.focusTrapFactory.create(containerElem);\r\nfocusTrap.focusInitialElementWhenReady();\r\noverlayRef.detachments().subscribe(() => focusTrap.destroy());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Maybe start implementing the dialog component on top of the dialog element could help avoid having to use focus traps, when browser compatibility requirements allows for it.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Visit https://material.angular.io/cdk/dialog/overview or https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/overview\r\n2. Open the first dialog example you find on the page.\r\n3. Click on the browser URL bar.\r\n4. Navigate to the page content using the Tab key.\r\n5. The focus is finally transferred to the web site top bar below the dialog's backdrop.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe focus should be transferred to the dialog elements without traversing the elements behind the dialog.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe focus is transferred the elements behind the dialog and not to the dialog elements.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 17.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox and Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Tested on Windows and Linux (Fedora)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28686","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-dialog): Focus trap is defeated if the user navigates to the browser chrome\" (#28686)"},{"Id":"2159615980","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-05T19:00:44","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"28660","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material-experimental/theming): provide hook for formatting toke…","State":"closed","Body":"…ns internally","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28660","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material-experimental/theming): provide hook for formatting toke…\" (#28660)"},{"Id":"2168323208","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-05T16:13:38","Actor":"Sonupro1997","Number":"28685","RawContent":null,"Title":"Datepicker design breaks Angular 13 ","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am using Angular Material 13.3.9 with a template-driven form that includes both a datetime picker (**@angular-material-components/datetime-picker\r\n)** and a simple material date picker.

However I do not believe the discussion has been concluded, or at least there is more documentation to be updated. I believe it to still be intentional, though unexpected behavior that optional inputs with a default value that are _not_ in the router config have their values set to undefined. That said, some excellent workarounds were provided [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52946#issuecomment-2091496673) and [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52946#issuecomment-2198484477).\n\nI admit that some of the more technical explanations and rational for the current behavior kindly provided by @atscott went over my head to a degree, but I still believe this to be an ongoing issue. At one point he stated that\n\n> Setting up an input with an initial value, i.e.@Input() readonly = true;, is an initial value only to be used when the owner of the component has not (yet) bound a value. It is not a default value, but an initial value.\n\nHowever the documentation does not make any mention of this. Indeed, [the documentation for inputs](https://angular.dev/guide/components/inputs#reading-inputs) explicitly refers to this as a _default value_. There is no mention in the documentation of the value being overwritten when the component is used in a routing context.\n\nAt minimum, I believe the documentation for input signals should be updated to reflect this (I first stumbled upon this issue Googling why my default value was undefined, without having any suspicion of router issues). Alternatively, I think there was a [good suggestion](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/52946#issuecomment-2455012957) to allow developers to include a strategy for an input, though I don't know what this would look like.\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\n[This page](https://angular.dev/guide/components/inputs#reading-inputs) should indicate that the default value is not necessarily a default value, but an _initial_ value, as well as explaining its interaction with `withComponentInputBinding`/usage in a router context, if not changing implementation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63835","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Resurrect discussion: bindToComponentInputs=true breaks default/initial value of field with @Input()\" (#63835)"},{"Id":"3423236287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T18:04:54","Actor":"andreasvg","Number":"63844","RawContent":null,"Title":"Styling of some links in Angular.dev is broken","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nMany of the links in the Angular documentation have broken styling, making them almost impossible to read (in both light and dark modes).\n\n### Light mode example:\n\n<img width=\"575\" height=\"592\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd9eb32-32fb-4fc7-96c9-d59582fac36e\" />\n\n### Same example in dark mode:\n\n<img width=\"617\" height=\"479\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3414bc79-7064-40f1-b5db-f4509601a97f\" />\n\nThis seems to be affecting a lot of the pages at the moment, and I have seen it in:\n\n- Chrome (Windows)\n- Edge (Windows)\n- Chrome (Mac)\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/tools/cli\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nJust browsing\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\n- I navigated to the Overview page (https://angular.dev/overview)\n- I clicked on the link to the Angular CLI documentation\n- I noticed that many links were not readable due to the styling bug\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\nI want to be able to read the link text in the documentation.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n<img width=\"617\" height=\"479\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49e7bf6b-4761-4ce2-baae-2fb90988e217\" />\n\n<img width=\"575\" height=\"592\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/362bf4b3-f108-4a98-9dd6-968a83ca801f\" />\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63844","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Styling of some links in Angular.dev is broken\" (#63844)"},{"Id":"3423221447","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T17:57:22","Actor":"lld4n","Number":"63843","RawContent":null,"Title":"Type narrowing is lost when accessing nested form controls in Angular generic reactive forms","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nforms\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nI found some strange behavior of the types in the form \n\n```typescript\ninterface RootForm {\n  children: FormGroup<ChildrenForm>;\n}\n\ninterface ChildrenForm {\n  field: FormControl<string>;\n}\n\n@Injectable()\nclass RootService<F extends RootForm> {\n  private fb = inject(FormBuilder);\n\n  public form = this.fb.nonNullable.array<FormGroup<F>>([]);\n}\n```\n\n```shell\nTYPESCRIPT ERROR: \nTS2344: Type F does not satisfy the constraint\n{ [K in keyof F]: AbstractControl<any, any>; }\nType QuestionForm is not assignable to type\n{ [K in keyof F]: AbstractControl<any, any>; }\n```\n\nok, i found a solution to fix this\n\n```typescript\ninterface RootForm extends Record<string, AbstractControl> {\n  children: FormGroup<ChildrenForm>;\n}\n```\n\nBUT this creates another problem:\n\n```typescript\n@Injectable()\nclass RootService<F extends RootForm> {\n  private fb = inject(FormBuilder);\n\n  public form = this.fb.nonNullable.array<FormGroup<F>>([]);\n\n  public childrenForm = computed(() => this.form.at(0).controls.children);\n}\n```\n\nType of childrenForm is `AbstractControl<any, any> | FormGroup<ChildrenForm>`, although I just want to see it there `FormGroup<ChildrenForm>`\n\nOf course, the type can be cast, but it is also necessary to take into account that the form can be `undefined`.

This leads to situations where errors are not logged in the console, and various services like DataDog, Sentry, etc., cannot track such errors.

Subsequent attempts to navigate to the same route continue to fail with a `TypeError: failed to fetch dynamically imported module`, even long after the network connection has been restored.\n\nThis creates a frustrating and broken user experience, as a portion of the application becomes permanently inaccessible. The only way for the user to recover is to perform a full page reload. Common programmatic workarounds, such as retrying navigation or resetting the router configuration from within a `NavigationError` handler, are ineffective and can lead to infinite loops.\n\nWe believe this is a critical resilience issue for modern single-page applications and propose that the framework should provide a built-in mechanism to handle this common scenario more gracefully.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1.  Create a standard Angular 19 application with standalone components.\n2.  Define at least two distinct lazy-loaded routes in `app.routes.ts`. For example:\n    ```typescript\n    export const routes: Routes = [\n      {\n        path: '',\n        loadComponent: () => import('./home/home.component').then(m => m.HomeComponent)\n      },\n      {\n        path: 'products',\n        loadComponent: () => import('./products/products.component').then(m => m.ProductsComponent)\n      },\n      {\n        path: 'customers',\n        loadComponent: () => import('./customers/customers.component').then(m => m.CustomersComponent)\n      }\n    ];\n    ```\n3.  Run the application using `ng serve`.\n4.  Open the application in the browser and use the Developer Tools to switch the network to **\"Offline\"**.\n5.  Click the link to navigate to the `/products` route.\n6.  Observe the expected `NavigationError` in the console and the failed network request for the component's JavaScript chunk in the Network tab.\n7.  In Developer Tools, switch the network back to **\"Online\"** (e.g., \"No throttling\").\n8.  Click the link to navigate to `/products` again.\n\n**Current Behavior:**\n\nThe navigation attempt fails again instantly with the same `TypeError`. The browser does not initiate a new network request for the module. The `/products` route is now in a permanently failed state.\n\nInterestingly, if you now try to navigate to the `/customers` route (which has not been visited before), it loads successfully, proving that the failure is cached on a per-route basis.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nAfter the network connection is restored, the next attempt to navigate to `/products` should succeed. The Angular Router should recognize that the previous attempt failed and re-initiate the dynamic `import()` function, which would trigger a new, successful network request to fetch the module.\n\n### **Investigation of Workarounds and Their Failure (Asking Gemini)**\n\nExtensive testing shows that there are currently no effective application-level workarounds to recover from this state without a full page reload.\n\n1.  **Programmatic Retry (`router.navigateByUrl`):**\n    Attempting to catch the `NavigationError` and programmatically retry the navigation results in an **infinite loop**.\n\n    ```typescript\n    // In app.component.ts\n    this.router.events.pipe(\n      filter((e): e is NavigationError => e instanceof NavigationError)\n    ).subscribe(error => {\n      // This causes an infinite loop\n      this.router.navigateByUrl(error.url); \n    });\n    ```\n\n    This happens because the router continuously re-uses the cached, rejected `Promise` associated with the lazy route, causing the navigation to fail repeatedly without ever re-issuing a network request.\n\n2.  **Resetting Router Configuration (`router.resetConfig`):**\n    Even a more drastic attempt to clear the router's state by using `router.resetConfig()` within the error handler **does not resolve the issue**.\n\n    ```typescript\n    // In app.component.ts\n      this.router.events.pipe(\n      filter((e): e is NavigationError => e instanceof NavigationError)\n    ).subscribe(error => {\n      // This does NOT clear the failed promise, the route still fails on next attempt\n      this.router.resetConfig([...appRoutes]); \n    });\n    ```\n\n    This surprising result suggests that the rejected `Promise` from the `import()` call is being cached at a level deeper than the router's active configuration, and this cache is not cleared by `resetConfig`.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### **Proposal and Justification**\n\nGiven that temporary network interruptions are a common reality for web users (especially on mobile devices), the current behavior presents a significant flaw in application resilience. Forcing a full-page reload (`location.reload()`) is a disruptive and poor user experience.\n\nWe propose that the Angular framework should provide a first-class, built-in solution for this problem. This could be:\n\n  * A configurable **retry strategy** on the `Route` definition itself.\n  * A new option for `provideRouter` (e.g., `withLazyLoadingRecovery()`) that changes the caching behavior for failed imports.\n  * An explicit API to **invalidate a failed lazy-loaded module**, allowing a fresh attempt on the next navigation.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n### **Alternatives Considered and Their Limitations**\n\nIn an attempt to mitigate the poor user experience, we have implemented a manual recovery mechanism by subscribing to the `NavigationError` event. The goal is to provide the user with immediate feedback and a path to resolution, even if it's not ideal.\n\nThe current working implementation is as follows:\n\n```typescript\n// In app.component.ts\n    this.router.events\n      .pipe(filter((e): e is NavigationError => e instanceof NavigationError))\n      .subscribe((event) => {\n        if (\n          event.error instanceof Error &&\n          event.error.message.includes(\n            'Failed to fetch dynamically imported module',\n          )\n        ) {\n          if (confirm('A new version is available. Reload now?')) {\n            // Handle the chunk load failure, reload the current page\n            window.location.assign(event.url);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63830","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request: Add a configurable retry mechanism for failed lazy-loaded module imports.\" (#63830)"},{"Id":"3421702399","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T11:11:20","Actor":"wartab","Number":"63827","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n ICU expressions don't work in attributes","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nlocalize, core\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nCouldn't really find another issue, but using ICU expressions in HTML-attributes doesn't work or even breaks the parser when using variables in ICU expressions.\n\nCan't get StackBlitz to work with `@angular/localize`, so I can't provide a minimal reproduction.\n\n\n```html\n\n<!-- This will just show the text as present in the title attribute -->\n<p i18n-title=\"@@test\" title=\"Some Val: {someVal, select, 1 {ONE} 2 {TWO} other {OTHER}}\">Hello</p>\n\n<!-- This will fail to parse, see error below -->\n<p i18n-title=\"@@test\" title=\"Updated {someVal, plural, =0 {just now} =1 {one minute ago} other {{{ someVal }} minutes ago}}\">Hello</p>\n\n<!-- This however, works fine -->\n<p i18n-title=\"@@test\" title=\"Updated {{someVal}} minute(s) ago\">Hello</p>\n```\n\nGiven you can use variables in attributes and that they already correctly create placeholders when extracting i18n, I think attributes should also be able to use ICU expressions.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nX [ERROR] NG5002: Parser Error: Missing expected } at the end of the expression [{ someVal ]\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.3.1\nNode: 22.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\nOS: win32 x64\n\n\nAngular: 20.3.0\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.1\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.1\n@angular/build               20.3.1\n@angular/cdk                 20.2.3\n@angular/cli                 20.3.1\n@angular/material            20.2.3\n@schematics/angular          20.3.1\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63827","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"i18n ICU expressions don't work in attributes\" (#63827)"},{"Id":"3421662253","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T10:55:39","Actor":"eneajaho","Number":"63826","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: expose an observable that emits when hydration has finished for the whole app","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nWe want to change some behavior based on hydration has finished event. \n\nRelated https://github.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/issues/1885\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n--\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nQuery the DOM every 1s to see if all the [ngh] attributes are gone from the DOM.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63826","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat: expose an observable that emits when hydration has finished for the whole app\" (#63826)"},{"Id":"3421201275","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T09:20:33","Actor":"robertIsaac","Number":"63825","RawContent":null,"Title":"rxResource is broken in angular 20","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nrxResource is missing the loader option in its interface which makes it to fail\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-h1cnovnj?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n✘ [ERROR] TS2769: No overload matches this call.\n  Overload 1 of 2, '(opts: RxResourceOptions<unknown, unknown> & { defaultValue: unknown; }): ResourceRef<unknown>', gave the following error.\n    Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'loader' does not exist in type 'RxResourceOptions<unknown, unknown> & { defaultValue: unknown; }'.\n  Overload 2 of 2, '(opts: RxResourceOptions<unknown, unknown>): ResourceRef<unknown>', gave the following error.\n    Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'loader' does not exist in type 'RxResourceOptions<unknown, unknown>'.

We’re building a webhook from our CMS to trigger a pipeline, but ng build does not support selectively prerendering specific routes.\n\nThis forces us to:\n\n* Rebuild all pages unnecessarily\n* Waste build time and resources\n* Overwrite unchanged prerendered content\n\n\nThe closest workaround is using the low-level `@angular/ssg `API (e.g. via a custom `scripts/prerender-specific.ts`), but this is not viable in Angular v17–20 as the `@angular/ssg` package is not public yet.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/79670012/how-to-pre-render-specific-route-on-cli\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPlease provide a way to build/prerender only a specific subset of routes — for example:\n\n```\nng prerender --routes=/article/2025-new-post,/article/2024-old-post\n```\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Better integration with headless CMS/webhooks\n- Efficient incremental builds\n- Much faster deployment cycles\n- Avoids regenerating unchanged routes\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nexpose `@angular/ssg` API","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31221","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ability to Prerender Specific Routes Only via CLI or Build Options\" (#31221)"},{"Id":"3419667132","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T06:47:55","Actor":"w-biggs","Number":"31213","RawContent":null,"Title":"async / await not being compiled for zone.js compatibility when `\"outputMode\":\"server\"`","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen building an app with `\"outputMode\":\"server\"`, two things are happening and I'm not sure which one is the issue:\n\n1. `zone.js` is not loaded in -- all requests hit a `NG0908` error. This is solved by adding `import 'zone.js';` at the top of `server.ts`; I'm not sure if this is expected or not.\n2. After fixing the `NG0908` error as above, `zone.js` is not being compiled to replace `async`/`await` with `Promise`s. \n\nThis is causing an issue when `withFetch()` is enabled where the Angular zone is exited during the request and never re-entered, causing errors to not be caught by the global error handler (and causing the app to crash if the request fails.)\n\nIt seems like `#2` may be caused by `#1` but the production codebase where I originally encountered this issue had `import 'zone.js'` added to the `server.ts` file way back in 2022 (possibly to resolve a similar issue, I wasn't there at the time), so I'm not sure if `#1` is unexpected or not. I'm considering `#2` to be the main issue but I can update the title if the root issue is `#1`. Thanks!\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have a fairly-minimal repro in this repository: https://github.com/w-biggs/angular-downlevel-async-withfetch-minimal-repro\n\nThe issue can be seen simply by building the app and viewing the compiled code. However, the withFetch crash errors that the issue causes can be reproduced by running the app and the static server and visiting `localhost:3000`.\n\nThe issue occurs since at least Angular v19.2.4, but the minimal repro has been updated to v20 to make sure this isn't a v19 issue.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/w-biggs/777facc0291bffdd51e85ce7d5a50ac7\n\nThis is what's printed when the app crashes, though I don't think it'll be very helpful for solving this issue (but who knows)\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n_                      _                 ____ _     ___\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.3.1\nNode: 22.16.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.0\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2003.1\n@angular-devkit/core         20.3.1 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.3.1\n@angular/build               20.3.1\n@angular/cli                 20.3.1\n@angular/ssr                 20.3.1\n@schematics/angular          20.3.1\nrxjs                         7.8.1\ntypescript                   5.9.2\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/31213","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"async / await not being compiled for zone.js compatibility when `\"outputMode\":\"server\"`\" (#31213)"},{"Id":"3420408493","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T05:06:18","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31218","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency aspect_rules_js to v2.6.0 (20.3.x)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [aspect_rules_js](https://docs.aspect.build/rules/aspect_rules_js) | bazel_dep | minor | `2.5.0` -> `2.6.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Users can now specify a reporter as a tuple of `[name, options]`.\r\n\r\n- The `schema.json` is updated to allow either a string or a `[string, object]` tuple in the `reporters` array. An `enum` is provided for common reporters while still allowing custom string paths.\r\n- The option normalization logic in `options.ts` is refactored into a shared helper function to handle both `reporters` and `codeCoverageReporters`, reducing code duplication.\r\n- The Karma runner, which does not support reporter options, is updated to safely ignore them and warn the user.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31211","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular/build): allow options for unit test reporters\" (#31211)"},{"Id":"3418973537","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T19:06:54","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31210","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): improve error handling in unit-test builder","State":"closed","Body":"Previously, exceptions thrown within a test runner would cause the entire builder process to terminate. This resulted in a poor user experience, especially in watch mode, as the process would crash instead of reporting the error and waiting for changes.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces more granular `try-catch` blocks around the test runner's lifecycle. When a runner throws an exception, the error is now caught, logged with a descriptive message, and the builder emits a failed result without crashing.\r\n\r\nTo prevent logs from being spammed by a persistently failing runner, a circuit breaker has been added. If the test runner fails with an exception for 3 consecutive runs, the builder will pause testing and exit to prevent an endless error loop. This circuit breaker is specifically designed to only trip on runner exceptions, not on standard test failures, to avoid disrupting a normal TDD workflow.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this commit re-enables and adjusts several related unit tests for the builder options to ensure they are passing and reflect the current behavior.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31210","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): improve error handling in unit-test builder\" (#31210)"},{"Id":"3418225628","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T19:06:42","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31208","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(@angular/build): enable unit-test builder coverage tests","State":"closed","Body":"The tests for the the `codeCoverage`, `codeCoverageExclude`, and `codeCoverageReporters` options have now been enabled.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31208","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(@angular/build): enable unit-test builder coverage tests\" (#31208)"},{"Id":"3418381085","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T15:05:04","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31209","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (main)","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://redirect.github.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `9b5fcad` -> `913311a` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c15774f` -> `35adff3` |\n| [@angular/common](https://redirect.github.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `aedfd62` -> `14941dc` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `53a0c18` -> `5a07003` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `d4e69e2` -> `ba560e0` |\n| [@angular/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `545467b` -> `f9231ec` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://redirect.github.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `c9ed25c` -> `110b645` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://redirect.github.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `85ba7ea` -> `0fcbf54` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://redirect.github.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `8b098ef` -> `7edcb4a` |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `416052f` -> `642887a` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `5fb8ed9` -> `e46fb25` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `03721fa` -> `f1aac3f` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `5b5cf96` -> `5b52952` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f59d247` -> `2018a85` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `7328479` -> `90642c8` |\n| [@angular/router](https://redirect.github.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `302f066` -> `154b2ff` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://redirect.github.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `884be2a` -> `da7aab3` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `35c6b5e` -> `0004737` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `35c6b5e` -> `0004737` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The use of spread syntax and optional chaining in the source code caused build problems in older versions of Node.js (spread syntax in <8.3.0 and optional chaining in 14.0.0), so the build targets for `baseline-browser-mapping` have been changed to ES2017 to ensure compatibility.\n- This release also changes the location of `main` in `package.json` to the CommonJS export, which should only be used in older versions of node.  Any version of node using that supports ESM build should use the default location(s) in the `exports` property.\n\nA big thank you to [@&#8203;BrightTan](https://redirect.github.com/BrightTan) for

(These are from the [Pointer Lock](https://w3c.github.io/pointerlock/) specification, the rest of which is not implemented.)\n- Added `customElements.getName()`. (mash-graz)\n- Updated the [virtual console](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/jsdom/blob/ab384d4e381eb6bb99ade4146698d35167b54837/README.md#virtual-consoles):\n  - `\"jsdomError\"` events are now documented, with specific `type` properties and other properties that depend on the type.\n  - `sendTo()` was renamed to `forwardTo()`.\n  - The `jsdomErrors` option to `forwardTo()` can be used to control which errors are sent to the Node.js console. This replaces the previous `omitJSDOMErrors` boolean option.\n  - `\"jsdomError\"`s for failed `XMLHttpRequest` fetches are no longer emitted.\n  - The values that are printed when forwarding `\"jsdomError\"`s to the Node.js console are streamlined.\n- Switched our CSS selector engine from [`nwsapi`](https://www.npmjs.com/nwsapi) to [`@asamuzakjp/dom-selector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;asamuzakjp/dom-selector), closing over 20 selector-related bugs.\n- Upgraded [`tough-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie), which now considers URLs like `http://localhost/` to be secure contexts (per [the spec](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy)), and thus will return `Secure`-flagged cookies for such URLs. (colincasey)\n- Upgraded [`cssstyle`](https://redirect.github.com/jsdom/cssstyle), which brings along many improvements and fixes to the `CSSStyleDeclaration` object and its properties.\n- Updated the user agent stylesheet to be derived from the HTML Standard, instead of from an old revision of Chromium.\n- Changed `element.click()` to fire a `PointerEvent` instead of a `MouseEvent`.\n- Changed certain events to be passive by default.\n- Changed the `<input>` element's `pattern=\"\"` attribute to use the `v` regular expression flag, instead of `u`.\n- Fixed many specification conformance issues with the `Window` object, including named properties and changing various data properties to accessor properties.\n- Fixed `document.createEvent()` to accept a more correct set of event names.\n- Fixed the `ElementInternals` accessibility getters and setters. (They were introduced in v23.1.0, but due to inadequate test coverage never actually worked.)\n- Fixed using `Object.defineProperty()` on certain objects, such as `HTMLSelectElement` instances.\n- Fixed `jsdom.reconfigure({ url })` not updating `document.baseURI` or properties derived from it. (This regressed in v26.1.0.)\n- Fixed CSS system colors, as well as the `initial`, `inherit`, and `unset` keywords, to resolve correctly. (asamuzaK)\n- Fixed CSS `display` style resolution. (asamuzaK)\n\n##### Changes since 27.0.0-beta.3\n\n- Upgraded `cssstyle`, which brings along various CSS parsing fixes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This fixes a bug where pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and couldn't find the \"time\" field as a result [#&#8203;9963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9963).\n- Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff [#&#8203;9914](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9914).\n\n### [`v10.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10160)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.1...v10.16.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This fixes a bug where pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and couldn't find the \"time\" field as a result [#&#8203;9963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9963).\n- Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff [#&#8203;9914](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9914).\n\n### [`v10.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10160)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.1...v10.16.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Write more than 5 lines inside the textarea\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe textarea should scroll to the cursor, if the cursor would be outside of the viewport otherwise.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe textarea does not scroll automatically in Chrome browsers.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.4, 20.3.0\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.4, 20.2.3\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31874","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdkTextareaAutosize): AutoResize doesn't scroll to cursor on Chrome\" (#31874)"},{"Id":"3420668421","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T06:34:59","Actor":"PowerKiKi","Number":"31873","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(dialog): Typing of new `MatDialogConfig.closePredicate`","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n#30919 introduced the new MatDialog config `closePredicate`. I am struggling to make typing work to have a 100% typed code.\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/9wtzaa17?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. open link, it does not compile, but I expect to compile\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAt first I expected that types would be flowing, so that I wouldn't need to repeat them. So my expected usage would be like:\n\n```ts\nthis.dialog.open<MyDialog, MyDialogData, MyDialogResult>(\n  MyDialog,\n  {\n    closePredicate: (\n      result,\n      config,\n      componentInstance\n    ) => {\n      return something();\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\nBut that failed to compile. So I tried to add typing like so:\n\n```ts\nthis.dialog.open<MyDialog, MyDialogData, MyDialogResult>(\n  MyDialog,\n  {\n    closePredicate: (\n      result: MyDialogResult | undefined,\n      config: MatDialogConfig<MyDialogData>,\n      componentInstance: MyDialog | null\n    ) => {\n      return componentInstance?.animal() !== 'my original data';\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThat also fail to compile. And I am out of ideas.\n\nAngular Material source never use this callback with any parameters (neither in implementation, nor in tests).\n\nWhat is the expected usage pattern here ? Is there a way to avoid repetition ?\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nStackblitz does not compile\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.1\n- CDK/Material: 20.1\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- TypeScript: 5.8.3","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31873","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(dialog): Typing of new `MatDialogConfig.closePredicate`\" (#31873)"},{"Id":"3419668249","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T22:06:55","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"31872","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/combobox): introduce new signals-based combobox","State":"open","Body":"* Create the Combobox UI Pattern class\r\n* Create the CdkCombobox, CdkComboboxInput, CdkComboboxPopupContent, and CdkComboboxPopup directives\r\n* Create 3 component examples.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31872","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/combobox): introduce new signals-based combobox\" (#31872)"},{"Id":"3413281482","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T21:55:04","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"31859","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `b09968f` -> `03721fa` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `30d78d3` -> `35c6b5e` |\n| devinfra | git_override | digest | `30d78d3` -> `35c6b5e` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This fixes a bug where pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and couldn't find the \"time\" field as a result [#&#8203;9963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9963).\n- Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff [#&#8203;9914](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9914).\n\n### [`v10.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10160)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.1...v10.16.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.\n\n  The new setting is called `minimumReleaseAge`. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.\n\n  If you set `minimumReleaseAge` but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - webpack\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;9921](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921).\n\n- Added support for `finders` [#&#8203;9946](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9946).\n\n  In the past, `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` could only search for dependencies by **name** (and optionally version). For example:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why minimist\n  ```\n\n  prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of `minimist`:\n\n  ```\n  verdaccio 5.20.1\n  ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7\n  │ └── minimist 1.2.8\n  └─┬ mv 2.1.1\n    └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6\n      └── minimist 1.2.8\n  ```\n\n  What if we want to search by **other properties** of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have `react@17` in their peer dependencies?\n\n  This is now possible with \"finder functions\". Finder functions can be declared in `.pnpmfile.cjs` and invoked with the `--find-by=<function name>` flag when running `pnpm list` or `pnpm why`.\n\n  Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our `.pnpmfile.cjs`:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\";\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Now we can use this finder function by running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm why --find-by=react17\n  ```\n\n  pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n  ```\n\n  It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    finders: {\n      react17: (ctx) => {\n        const manifest = ctx.readManifest();\n        if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === \"^17.0.0\") {\n          return `license: ${manifest.license}`;\n        }\n        return false;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Every matched package will also print out the license from its `package.json`:\n\n  ```\n  @&#8203;apollo/client 4.0.4\n  ├── @&#8203;graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0\n  │   license: MIT\n  └── graphql-tag 2.12.6\n      license: MIT\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9529](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9529).\n- Throw an error if `nodeVersion` is not set to an exact semver version [#&#8203;9934](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9934).\n- `pnpm publish` should be able to publish a `.tar.gz` file [#&#8203;9927](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9927).\n- Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make `pnpm run` return a non-zero exit code [#&#8203;9626](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9626).\n\n### [`v10.15.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10151)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.15.0...v10.15.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `.pnp.cjs` crash when importing subpath [#&#8203;9904](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9904).\n- When resolving peer dependencies, pnpm looks whether the peer dependency is present in the root workspace project's dependencies. This change makes it so that the peer dependency is correctly resolved even from aliased npm-hosted dependencies or other types of dependencies [#&#8203;9913](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9913).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This makes the textarea very difficult to use.\n\nThe problem occurs on Google Chrome (but not in Firefox).\n\nIt appeared starting from Angular Material v19.\n\nIn v18, the behavior was correct: https://v18.material.angular.dev/cdk/text-field/overview\n\nFrom v19 up to the current version, the bug is reproducible in Chrome: https://material.angular.dev/cdk/text-field/overview\n\nThank you for your help and clarification.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ozyjlswf?file=src%2Fexample%2Ftext-field-autosize-textarea-example.html\nSteps to reproduce:\nUsing google Chrome:\n1. start typing in the textarea (add lines pressing enter)\n2. when more that 5 lines are added, cursor deapear and we are typing in the hidden part of the textarea (we don't see what we are typing anymore)\n\nDo the same on Firefox:\n- the textarea scrolls automatically to active line\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe textarea does not scroll automatically to the active line on google chrome\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe textarea should scroll automatically to the active line on all nagigators\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20\n- CDK/Material: 20\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System: Windows, macOS, Ubuntu\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CdkTextareaAutosize): Textarea does not scroll to active line\" (#31871)"},{"Id":"3418122357","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T14:04:01","Actor":"rsi21","Number":"31870","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(datepicker): For some locales, the format used on display is not matching the short date format","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHello, \n\nWe use the Material date picker to fill several dates and then display them with 'shortDate' pipe.\nWe also work/switch with from several locales, and we notice some inconsistencies for some of them:\n\n- de-DE\n\n<img width=\"348\" height=\"207\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bccd7f65-e399-489b-b76a-c95f998d76f5\" />\n\n- nl-NL\n\n<img width=\"367\" height=\"202\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69962e5-701e-495a-8564-83ab62439a29\" />\n\nIf we look at fr-FR for example, the display is correct and consistent:\n\n<img width=\"367\" height=\"207\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1462c799-e111-403b-8519-88ad1f84a061\" />\n\nI know CDRL is used behind the scene for locale management here, but as datePicker and shortDate are both provided by Angular, i suspect more an inconstentcy between both components.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Use a sample angular 20 application, and declare provideNativeDateAdapter()\n2. Use natively the DatePicker component to select the date\n3.

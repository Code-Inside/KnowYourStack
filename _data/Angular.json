The qualifier is missing for 1 item, but added for >1 item. This component CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:is(.foo) :host {}\r\n:is(.foo, .bar) :host {}\r\n\r\n:host :is(.foo)  {}\r\n:host :is(.foo, .bar)  {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiles to:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:is(.foo)   [_nghost-kfp-c134] {}\r\n[_ngcontent-kfp-c134]:is(.foo, .bar)   [_nghost-kfp-c134] {}\r\n\r\n[_nghost-kfp-c134]   [_ngcontent-kfp-c134]:is(.foo)  {}\r\n[_nghost-kfp-c134]   [_ngcontent-kfp-c134]:is(.foo, .bar)[_ngcontent-kfp-c134]  {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-yc96o6?file=src/app/app.component.css demonstrates a live reproduction of this issue.\r\n\r\nFor my specific use case, I had a selector that looked like`:is(a, b, c) :host`. I was able to work around the problem by rewriting it to either of `:host-context(a, b, c) :host` or `a :host, b :host, c :host` (both compile to the same output). But in general, using `:is` and `:where` seems either unsupported or broken. If it's unsupported, I think it would be helpful if the compiler threw an error because the current behavior is hard to predict and does not seem useful.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-yc96o6?file=src/app/app.component.css\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nI'm not using `ng`, so I can't provide `ng version` output. But the reproduction in StackBlitz is using @angular/* packages at version 13.3.3.\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/45686","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Emulated view encapsulation incorrectly transforms CSS that uses `:is()` or `:where()`\" (#45686)"},{"Id":"1208253474","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-19T22:09:38","Actor":"JenPeleva","Number":"45676","RawContent":null,"Title":"There is an html tag in the Angular install sample","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nIn this article https://angular.io/guide/setup-local, the install globally sample has an html tag inside it:\r\n\r\n\"npm install -g @angular/cli<aio-angular-dist-tag class=\"pln\"></aio-angular-dist-tag\"\r\n\r\n### What is the affected URL?\r\n\r\n https://angular.io/guide/setup-local\r\n\r\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nGo to **Install the Angular CLI**\r\n\r\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\r\n\r\nThe correct console message shouldn't contain html\r\n\r\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\r\n\r\nhttps://www.screencast.com/t/p2lQs2vt\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

[`v14.0.0-next.14`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next14-2022-04-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.13...14.0.0-next.14)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### http\n\n-   Queries including + will now actually query for + instead of space.\n    Most workarounds involving custom codecs will be unaffected.\n    Possible server-side workarounds will need to be undone.\n\n##### router\n\n-   The type of `component` on `ActivatedRoute` and `ActivatedRouteSnapshot`\n    includes `string`. In reality, this is not the case. The component\n    cannot be anything other than a component class.\n\n-   Lazy loaded configs are now also validated once loaded like the\n    initial set of routes are. Lazy loaded modules which have invalid Route\n    configs will now error. Note that this is only done in dev mode so\n    there is no production impact of this change.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### router\n\n-   The `resolver` argument of the `RouterOutletContract.activateWith` function and the `resolver` field of the `OutletContext` class are deprecated. Passing component factory resolvers are no longer needed.

I think this is rather confusing since `source-map-loader` is a webpack loader which should only be used at build time.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure though if some code of `source-map-loader` actually ends up in the bundle or the source maps are just wrongly pointing to it.

This will involve fewer passes: the current function iterates over the keys, searches the map for each key to construct a string, then searches the string. It will also remove the risk presented by the unicode delimiter.\r\nIt will also present an improvement over @daniel-brenot's PR https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21362 which, similarly to the original function, iterates over the keys and then searches the map for their corresponding value. This check is superfluous when an array of values is available.\r\nPerformance-wise, a further gain in speed is present over both previous techniques. I have updated Daniel's benchmark script to include the new function, as well as some logic to print results for veracity, check failure performance, and populate a map with n generated UUIDs to help examine performance at scale.\r\nhttps://jsbench.me/9bl258ffo3/2\r\nAt 1,000 entries, the original function is ~80% slower, Daniel's is ~42% slower at successes.\r\nFailures are roughly 65%, 39% slower, respectively.\r\nAt 10,000 entries, successes are roughly 84%, 32% slower.\r\nFailures at 10k are roughly 75%, 24% slower.\r\nFor completeness, at 10 entries, successes: 63, 11, failures: 55, 9.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/24803","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix: update table predicate filter\" (#24803)"},{"Id":"1210283190","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T22:29:55","Actor":"br-kwon","Number":"24811","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatAutocompleteTrigger): callback applied to closed EventEmitter runs outside of the Angular Zone on outside click","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe callback applied to the `closed` EventEmitter seems to run outside of the Angular Zone when `closed` is emitted via \"outside click\"\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-83t6vu?file=src/app/autocomplete.component.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. click inside input - should open panel and disable button\r\n2. click outside panel to close it - expect button to be enabled, but remains disabled\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nclicking outside the panel to close the panel should have disabled the button without using `ngZone.run()`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nthe button remains disabled\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 13.3.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.3.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/24811","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatAutocompleteTrigger): callback applied to closed EventEmitter runs outside of the Angular Zone on outside click\" (#24811)"},{"Id":"1210258017","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T21:58:32","Actor":"zarend","Number":"24810","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(select): cannot close non-native select menu with Talkback and iOS voiceover without selecting an option","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nFor the non-native select, there is no way to close the options menu on mobile screen readers without selection an option.

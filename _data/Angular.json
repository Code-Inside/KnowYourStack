'On' : 'Off' }}</button>\n```\n\nAnd the easiest way is to use the [select clause ICU expression](https://angular.dev/guide/i18n/prepare#mark-alternates-and-nested-expressions) like this:\n\n```\n<button i18n>{ active, select, true { On } false { Off } }</button>\n```\n\nbut the documentation says:\n> The select clause marks choices for alternate text based on your defined <ins>**string values**</ins>.\n\nIn my case, `active` property is a boolean and I'm using true/false like it's a boolean selection_category but it is actually interpreted as text. \n\nIs this usage officially supported or is this a strange/hacky case that just happens to work because of boolean to string conversion?\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nEither:\n1. Explicitly say in the documentation that using the select ICU expression with a boolean property is supported and provide an example.\n   - In that case, could the select clause be compile checked to make sure true and false categories, and only true and false, are specified?\n3. Create a specific boolean ICU expression, for example: `{ active, bool, true { On } false { Off } } `\n4. Add support for `$localize` and back quotes (`` ` ``) in template to be able to do: ``<button>{{ active ? $localize`On` : $localize`Off` }}</button>``\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe can define a method in the component and use it like that:\n```\nexport class ExampleComponent {\n   active: boolean;\n   getActiveText(): string {\n      return active ? $localize`On` : $localize`Off`\n   }\n}\n```\n```\n<button>{{ getActiveText() }}</button>\n```\n\nBut it will tend to complicate your component script with a lot of meaningless methods, and I feel that this use case could be simplified.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58943","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support i18n boolean expression in template\" (#58943)"},{"Id":"2699806084","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T20:53:06","Actor":"aboudard","Number":"58942","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add outputs migration page","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Not sure if there could anything be done about it or if it's just a limitation of TypeScript. See example below:\n\nWhen using the following signature, all types are figured out correctly:\n```ts\nconst resourceRef = resource({\n  request: () => {\n    const id = numberSignal();\n    if (id == null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return { id };\n  },\n  loader: ({ request: { id } }) => {\n    return Promise.resolve(String(id))\n  }\n})\n```\nThe type of `id` in the loader's request argument is correctly inferred as `number`. The type of `resourceRef` is `ResourceRef<string>`.\nNotice how I didn't have to specify any types explicitly. Everything just works.\n\nHowever, if options are declared separately, things fall apart:\n\n```ts\nconst resourceOptions = {\n  request: () => {\n    const id = numberSignal();\n    if (id == null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return { id };\n  },\n  loader: ({ request: { id } }) => {\n    return Promise.resolve(String(id))\n  }\n} satisfies ResourceOptions<any, any>;\n\nconst resourceRef = resource(resourceOptions);\n```\n\nWith this, the type of resourceRef is correct: `ResourceRef<string>`. However, the type of `id` in loader's request argument is `any`.\n\nAlso, this might have something to do with the comment about an issue with `NoInfer`: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58871#issuecomment-2498195267\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMaking generic types optional by  providing default `any` value makes it slightly easier to work with, but overall does not provide the dev experience I'm after.\n\n```ts\nexport interface ResourceOptions<T = any, R = any> {\n  request?: () => R;\n  loader: ResourceLoader<T, R>;\n  equal?: ValueEqualityFn<T>;\n  injector?: Injector;\n}\n```\n\nNeed guidance from someone more experienced with TypeScript.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nCreate a function that takes options and returns them. This seems silly since it seemingly just adds boilerplate, but it works:\n\n```ts\nfunction createResourceOptions<T, R>(options: ResourceOptions<T, R>): ResourceOptions<T, R> {\n  return options;\n}\n\nconst resourceOptions = createResourceOptions({\n  request: () => {\n    const id = numberSignal();\n    if (id == null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return { id };\n  },\n  loader: ({ request: { id } }) => {\n    return Promise.resolve(String(id))\n  }\n});\n\nconst resourceRef = resource(resourceOptions);\n```\nAll types are figured out correctly.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dev experience when passing around ResourceOptions is suboptimal\" (#58941)"},{"Id":"2699128862","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T18:48:42","Actor":"anthony-b-dev","Number":"58936","RawContent":null,"Title":"NgComponentOutlet documentation is broken","State":"closed","Body":"At the end of the usage section, the complex example is cut off. \n\n[angular.dev](https://angular.dev/api/common/NgComponentOutlet?tab=usage-notes)\n\nThis line seems to be broken. \n\n`{@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='CompleteExample'}`\n\n[ng_component_outlet.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/30891d8dec1060c4471563346deb60be4946c807/packages/common/src/directives/ng_component_outlet.ts#L89)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58936","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NgComponentOutlet documentation is broken\" (#58936)"},{"Id":"2699458792","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T18:42:35","Actor":"martinboue","Number":"58940","RawContent":null,"Title":"Check if a required input is provided using `withComponentInputBinding`","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncompiler\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using `withComponentInputBinding` in ApplicationConfig, I can pass:\n \n- query parameters\n- path and matrix parameters\n- static route data\n- data from resolvers \n\nto component via inputs.

Instead, it should stay on https://v18.angular.dev/.\n2. **Stable Version Clarity**: The dropdown should include an option labeled stable, which links to the latest stable documentation version, currently https://angular.dev/.\n3.  **Comprehensive Version Listing**: The dropdown should explicitly list all versions, including those beyond v18 (e.g., v19, v20) as they are released, for easy navigation without ambiguity.\n\nThese changes will ensure a more intuitive and seamless user experience when navigating between Angular versions.\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03c3929e-7ed4-4a5a-be33-d6ac988f343a)\n\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58918","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs:  Version dropdown on v18.angular.dev redirects to incorrect URL and lacks clarity in version listing\" (#58918)"},{"Id":"2696266613","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-26T22:27:58","Actor":"samuelfernandez","Number":"58917","RawContent":null,"Title":"Promise API for resource","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nIdeally, resource would expose a promise as part of its public API that:\n\n* Would be pending while the resource is loading\n* Would resolve when the status is loaded\n* Would reject with the error\n\nIt would be a fit to use in async calls or route resolvers.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt could be a new method named `resolve()` or similar.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing effects to watch the state and generate a promise.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58917","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Promise API for resource\" (#58917)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2697750541","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T21:48:33","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28983","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): add timeout to route extraction","State":"closed","Body":"This commit introduces a 30-second timeout for route extraction.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28983","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): add timeout to route extraction\" (#28983)"},{"Id":"2695989169","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T21:28:34","Actor":"javiermarinros","Number":"28979","RawContent":null,"Title":"`ng build` stuck in a SSG + Zoneless app","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI'm trying to build an SSG and Zoneless site using the latest version of Angular, 19, as well as the new SSR rendering APIs.\n\nHowever, the process gets stuck indefinitely, without providing any clue as to what might be happening, not even when running it with the `--verbose` flag.\n\nThe development server is working as intended.

But since all my thousands tests passed before, now I get dozens of random errors across my apps but the common point seems to be the use of `jasmine.clock()` at some key points. I get multiple times this cryptic error : \n\n`Error: Jasmine Clock was unable to install over custom global timer functions.

Nothing more. An boom, I got the error I mentionned earlier.\nSorry I can't provide you much more informations as I just don't understand what's going on but I hope someone will find a way to solve this problem which seems to be the source of all my trouble in unit tests with esbuild.\n\nThank you for your efforts :)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nError: Jasmine Clock was unable to install over custom global timer functions.

Even the root path works, because the potentialLocale is '' (empty string) in this case, but no child routes can be found (at least not with ssr). Is this behavior expected? If so, are there still any workarounds to disable the locale prefix for a specific locale?\n\nIn a (maybe) naive approach, I tried adding the following line just before returning the entryPointExport in [app-engine.ts#L146](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blame/7b0aa3dec56298bb364516ac189aa32accc7dcc2/packages/angular/ssr/src/app-engine.ts#L146) and it worked, so it seems to be supported everywhere except in this particular location and therefore I really hope it's just a bug and I don't have to revert the migration.\n```javascript\nif (!entryPoints.has(potentialLocale) && entryPoints.has(\"\")) {\n    return this.getEntryPointExports(\"\");\n}\n```\n\nAny help is appreciated, because everything else is already migrated.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nRepo: https://github.com/eufri/angular-ssr-issue\n\nBasically I have created a new app\n`ng new angular-ssr-issue --ssr --minimal --package-manager=yarn --routing --server-routing --skip-tests --ssr`\n\nAdded localize package\n`ng add @angular/localize`\n\nAnd then added some test locales + messages and a child component +route\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular: 19.0.0\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.1\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.1\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.1\n@angular/cli                    19.0.1\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.1\n@schematics/angular             19.0.1\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28967","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Set locale baseHref to '/' is not working with AngularNodeAppEngine\" (#28967)"},{"Id":"2692373245","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T21:54:18","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28966","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.0.2 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.0.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28966","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.0.2 release\" (#28966)"},{"Id":"2692286139","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T21:49:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28964","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.0.2\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28964","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.0.2\" with changelog.\" (#28964)"},{"Id":"2690105055","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T20:17:31","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28954","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): prevent errors with parameterized routes when `getPrerenderParams` is undefined","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nEnsure that parameterized routes do not cause errors when the `getPrerenderParams` function is undefined, specifically in cases where the routing API is not utilized.\r\n\r\nCloses #28948\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28954","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): prevent errors with parameterized routes when `getPrerenderParams` is undefined\" (#28954)"},{"Id":"2691768844","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T20:04:28","Actor":"clydin","Number":"28961","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): maintain previous compiler plugin factory signature","State":"closed","Body":"To minimize downstream breakage for consumers of the private API, the `createCompilerPlugin` function signature has been adjusted to maintain compatibility with v18.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28961","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular/build): maintain previous compiler plugin factory signature\" (#28961)"},{"Id":"2690072011","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T20:02:35","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28953","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): minimize reliance on esbuild `inject` to prevent code reordering","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nResolved an issue where the use of `esbuild`'s `inject` feature caused incorrect reordering of class structures during bundling.

This occurs while the parent `mat-form-field` maintains a minimum height of 56px.\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-starter-wybpxw?file=src%2Findex.html,src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.  using the mouse, reduce the `textarea` height below 24pixels => a vertical scrollbar appears\n\nThis bug can also be reproduced on Material's documentation: https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview#form-field-overview\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should not be possible to reduce a `textarea` height below 24px, which represents a single line of text.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen a `textarea` height is reduced below 24px, a vertical scrollbar appears even though the parent `mat-form-field` keeps a minimal height of 56px.\n\nI also noticed that when the `textarea` height is reduced from 28px to 27px, the text within the `textarea` is moved up by 1px. The same behavior can be observed down to 24px. I couldn't understand why this occurs and I'm not sure it is related to the height problem described above.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18.2.8\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.8 (but could be reproduced on all versions of the Material documentation)\n- Browser(s): Edge 131.0.2903.51 / Chrome 130.0.6723.116\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows / Ubuntu\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30089","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatFormField): textarea can be reduce to a smaller height than it's content\" (#30089)"},{"Id":"2694674511","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-26T17:28:46","Actor":"JankaSvK","Number":"30088","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs): Fix missing comma in the example theme config","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30088","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(docs): Fix missing comma in the example theme config\" (#30088)"},{"Id":"2684539001","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-26T11:50:57","Actor":"royeradames","Number":"30071","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Material Migration Pain Point: Version Lock-in Prevents Incremental Updates","State":"closed","Body":"## Issue Description\nWhen upgrading from Angular Material v12 to v18, organizations face significant challenges due to:\n\n1. Inability to run different versions of Material UI simultaneously during migration\n2. Requirement to upgrade both Angular and Material UI versions together\n3. Major internal architecture changes in Material UI (particularly v14-15)\n4. No supported path for incremental component migration\n\n## Impact\n\n- Large applications with custom Material UI implementations are effectively locked into Angular 14 or below.\n- Organizations must choose between:\n\n  - Maintaining legacy versions indefinitely\n  - Complete system-wide upgrade with significant business impact\n\n\n- Increased technical debt as teams delay upgrades\n- Higher migration costs due to required \"big bang\" approach\n\n## Requested Solution\nPlease consider implementing:\n\n1. Support for running multiple Material versions simultaneously\n2. Backward compatibility layers for core APIs\n3. Tooling for incremental migration paths\n\n## Context\nOur organization maintains a large Angular application using Material UI v12 with extensive customizations. The current upgrade path requirements make it nearly impossible to maintain both system stability and technical currency.

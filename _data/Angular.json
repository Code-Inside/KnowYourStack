Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nWhen the visibility (e.g. *ngIf) of a component changes during the change detection cycle, the length of a `QueryList` may change. The new length is only correct in the `ngAfterViewChecked()` event, but then it is too late to make any view changes. If the length of any of the QueryLists changes during the change detection cycle, it seems to me that another cycle should be run automatically. I can manually check for this and use `setTimeout()` to run another cycle, but this smells hacky. I think another cycle should be automatic.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-uj7lnn\r\n\r\nIn the stackblitz, if you uncomment out the noted line in `ngAfterViewChecked()` or if you click the `run change detection` button, the count in the console is correct.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.2\r\nNode: 12.3.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30922","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ViewChildren QueryList should run change detection when count changes\" (#30922)"},{"Id":"453606608","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T16:54:48","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"30921","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(ivy): WIP","State":"open","Body":"Just in case I get hit by a meteor during the weekend.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30921","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(ivy): WIP\" (#30921)"},{"Id":"453594188","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T16:21:41","Actor":"ocombe","Number":"30920","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): correctly set `TView.firstChild` with runtime i18n","State":"open","Body":"`TView.firstChild` was defined as the first node with index 0, but when we use runtime i18n then the instruction `i18nStart` can be the one with index 0 and the first node will be index 1 or more.\r\nWith this fix we set `TView.firstChild` when we see the first node with index 0 or later if `TView.firstChild` is still null.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30920","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): correctly set `TView.firstChild` with runtime i18n\" (#30920)"},{"Id":"453469744","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T15:53:47","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"30914","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ngcc - remove unused import to make linting pass","State":"closed","Body":"The failure is caused by 65f20107f.

this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 7.2.15\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Tests fail to complete when assigning properties to `this`.\r\nThe Jasmine documentation under https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite explains the usage of `this` as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe this keyword\r\nAnother way to share variables between a beforeEach, it, and afterEach is through the this keyword. Each spec's beforeEach/it/afterEach has the this as the same empty object that is set back to empty for the next spec's beforeEach/it/afterEach.\r\n```\r\n```typescript\r\ndescribe(\"A spec\", function() {\r\n  beforeEach(function() {\r\n    this.foo = 0;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it(\"can use the `this` to share state\", function() {\r\n    expect(this.foo).toEqual(0);\r\n    this.bar = \"test pollution?\";\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it(\"prevents test pollution by having an empty `this` created for the next spec\", function() {\r\n    expect(this.foo).toEqual(0);\r\n    expect(this.bar).toBe(undefined);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I include `this` references in my test suite the tests fail with\r\n```\r\nFailed: Cannot set property 'foo' of undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Assign something to `this` in any test\r\n- Run `ng test`\r\n\r\nShould be fairly simple to reproduce, but in case example is necessary a reproduction of the issue is hosted at https://github.com/jakkn/angular8-cli-ng-test-this-bug-repro\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!--

The concept of `allowNull` also doesn't really apply when getting a list of elements\r\n- The `find` method is confusing as it doesn't actually find anything, it returns a function to find things\r\n- The user is required to specify the host selector for the harness they want to load, even though the harness should always know what selector its looking for\r\n\r\n## New API\r\nThe new API combines the variaous `load` methods as well as the `Locator` class from the old API into a single class called `HarnessEnvironment`. The `HarnessEnvironment` implements two separate interfaces, one for test authors: `HarnessLoader`, and one for component harness authors: `LocatorFactory`. Both protractor and testbed have their own concrete implementations of `HarnessEnvironment`, but they cannot be constructed directly. Users are required to construct them via a `create` method which returns a `HarnessLoader` interface. This way only the methods that make sense for the test author are exposed to the test author.\r\n\r\nThe `HarnessLoader` provides methods to find new `HarnessLoader`s for sub-portions of the DOM and methods to create `ComponentHarness`es by searching for the corresponding host selector under its root element. Each `ComponentHarness` class is required to specify its host selector, so the user doesn't have to.\r\n\r\nThe `LocatorFactory` is the interface to the `HarnessEnvironent` available when extending `ComponentHarness`. It gives harness authors methods to create locator functions for finding `TestElement`s and `ComponentHarness`es under its root element. It also provides a method to get a `LocatorFactory` rooted at the document root, this can be used instead of the `global` option from the old API.\r\n\r\nThe methods described above for finding `HarnessLoader`s `ComponentHarnesses` and locator functions come in 3 different flavors (required, optional, and all). These different variants should be used instead of the old `allowNull` syntax. There is currently no replacement for `{allowNull: undefined}` but if we feel its important we can add a default variant of the method as well.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n### Component harness author code\r\n```ts\r\n// Old\r\nclass MyHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  readonly header = this.find(MyHeaderHarness, 'my-header', {allowNull: false});\r\n  readonly overlay = this.find('.my-overlay', {allowNull: false, global: true});\r\n}\r\n\r\n// New\r\nclass MyHarness extends ComponentHarness {\r\n  readonly header = this.requiredLocator(MyHeaderHarness);\r\n  readonly overlay = this.documentRootLocatorFactory().optionalLocator('.my-overlay');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test author code\r\n```ts\r\n// Old\r\nit('does stuff', async () => {\r\n  const harness = load(MyHarness, fixture);\r\n  // Not possible to load harness for specific subsection\r\n});\r\n\r\n// New\r\nit('does stuff', async () => {\r\n  const harness = await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.harnessForFixtureRoot(MyHarness, fixture);\r\n  const subsectionLoader = await TestvedHarnessEnvironment.create(fixture).findRequired('.sub-section');\r\n  const subsectionHarness = await subsectionLoader.requiredHarness(MyHarness);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- Should we add a plain `locator` method that behaves the same as `requiredLocator` for unit tests but doesn't check `element.isPresent` in e2e tests?\r\n- Its slightly more verbose, but should we call the methods `locatorForRequired`? It reads a little nicer: `this.locatorForRequired(MyCompHarness)`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16234","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk-experimental/testing): Refactor the ComponentHarness API\" (#16234)"},{"Id":"453643632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T18:37:12","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"16233","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: remove `indent_size = 2` from editorconfig as it messes up the continuation indent","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16233","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"chore: remove `indent_size = 2` from editorconfig as it messes up the continuation indent\" (#16233)"},{"Id":"452282697","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T18:37:12","Actor":"chigix","Number":"16206","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(form-field): make outline appearance input field auto fit parent component","State":"closed","Body":"the `.mat-form-field-wrapper` element currently would not fit to the parent `mat-form-field` component width in outline appearance.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16206","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(form-field): make outline appearance input field auto fit parent component\" (#16206)"},{"Id":"453643022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T18:35:38","Actor":"james-schwartzkopf","Number":"16232","RawContent":null,"Title":"v7 mat-form-field docs link to non versioned custom control guide (v8)","State":"open","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you switch to the v7 documentation and go to the form field component page, the link to the \"Creating Custom mat-form-field Controls\" guide takes you to the current page instead of to the v7 page.\r\n\r\nWe noticed this when trying to find a working stackblitz version of the example (since the current one is broken), but it looks like there is already an issue open (#13195) for that part of the problem.\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:** \r\nhttps://v7.material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview#custom-form-field-controls\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control\r\nshould be:\r\nhttps://v7.material.angular.io/guide/creating-a-custom-form-field-control\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16232","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"v7 mat-form-field docs link to non versioned custom control guide (v8)\" (#16232)"},{"Id":"453634724","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T18:13:17","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16231","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove version placeholder workaround","State":"open","Body":"Removes the duplicate version placeholder variable which is\r\nno longer needed since we moved the Material version symbol\r\ninto the `@angular/material/core` secondary entry-point.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16231","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): remove version placeholder workaround\" (#16231)"},{"Id":"453618275","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T17:27:59","Actor":"bdonald25","Number":"16230","RawContent":null,"Title":"Changing tabs while parent div is animating into the page causes the content to disappear.","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nHere is a StackBlitz to reproduce the issue: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-yqxzaq\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

A typical user touch does not show up as a single mouse down/up sequence at the same coordinate, as movement of the finger causes a bit of coordinate shift, so that the down and up may not occur at the same place.  As a result, this makes it extremely difficult to select checkboxes and radio buttons on a touch interface.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8\r\n- CDK/Material: 8\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox 67.0\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16223","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Click and drag inside checkbox or radio button on Firefox fails to register as select - major touch issue\" (#16223)"},{"Id":"453153328","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-06T17:31:54","Actor":"calebegg","Number":"16222","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove redundant selector term","State":"open","Body":"The extra term unnecessarily raises specificity of this selector to e.g. `.mat-flat-button[disabled][disabled]`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16222","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Remove redundant selector term\" (#16222)"},{"Id":"452912114","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-06T16:54:09","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16218","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ng-update): parse cli workspace config as json5","State":"closed","Body":"Currently we try to parse CLI workspace configurations gracefully by\r\nusing the native `JSON.parse()` method.

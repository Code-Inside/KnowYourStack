And the interface without Partial `{ email: string, password: string }` cannot be retrieved.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to make FormGroup read-only where validators cannot be changed. This allows control of the interface type if the FormGroup is valid.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface LoginForm {\r\n    email: FormControl<string>;\r\n    password: FormControl<string>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst login = new FormGroup<LoginForm>({\r\n    email: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),\r\n    password: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),\r\n}, { nonChangeable: true });\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can get object with type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (this.login.valid) {\r\n  const loginValidValue: { email: string, password: string } =  login.validValue;\r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the formGroup is not valid, then `validValue` may return null or a partial value.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI looked at the current issues, but did not find anything similar.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47122","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"(forms) Add a new property validValue for FormGroup<T> that will return a valid object T if the FormGroup is valid.\" (#47122)"},{"Id":"1336628117","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-12T00:44:14","Actor":"kormide","Number":"47135","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(bazel): refactor aio example e2es to fix windows performance","State":"open","Body":"@devversion @gkalpak @josephperrott @gregmagolan \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

That's not how the rest of esbuild's internals work, however, and doing this messed up esbuild's node module path resolution regarding automatically-detected `index.js` files. Previously packages that relied on implicit `index.js` resolution rules didn't work with esbuild under Yarn PnP. Removing this slash has fixed esbuild's path resolution behavior regarding `index.js`, which should now the same both with and without Yarn PnP.\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP support for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;2456](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2456))\n\n    Previously using `extends` in `tsconfig.json` with a path in a Yarn PnP package didn't work. This is because the process of setting up package path resolution rules requires parsing `tsconfig.json` files (due to the `baseUrl` and `paths` features) and resolving `extends` to a package path requires package path resolution rules to already be set up, which is a circular dependency. This cycle is broken by using special rules for `extends` in `tsconfig.json` that bypasses esbuild's normal package path resolution process. This is why using `extends` with a Yarn PnP package didn't automatically work. With this release, these special rules have been modified to check for a Yarn PnP manifest so this case should work now.\n\n-   Fix Yarn PnP support in `esbuild-wasm` ([#&#8203;2458](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2458))\n\n    When running esbuild via WebAssembly, Yarn PnP support previously failed because Go's file system internals return `EINVAL` when trying to read a `.zip` file as a directory when run with WebAssembly. This was unexpected because Go's file system internals return `ENOTDIR` for this case on native. This release updates esbuild to treat `EINVAL` like `ENOTDIR` in this case, which fixes using `esbuild-wasm` to bundle a Yarn PnP project.\n\n    Note that to be able to use `esbuild-wasm` for Yarn PnP successfully, you currently have to run it using `node` instead of `yarn node`. This is because the file system shim that Yarn overwrites node's native file system API with currently generates invalid file descriptors with negative values when inside a `.zip` file. This prevents esbuild from working correctly because Go's file system internals don't expect syscalls that succeed without an error to return an invalid file descriptor. Yarn is working on fixing their use of invalid file descriptors.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>stylus/stylus</summary>\n\n### [`v0.59.0`](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/blob/HEAD/Changelog.md#&#8203;0590--2022-08-13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/compare/0.58.1...0.59.0)\n\n\\===================\n\n-   deps: switching from css to [@&#8203;adobe/css-tools](https://togithub.com/adobe/css-tools) [#&#8203;2709](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/pull/2709)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

At the same time, we've been getting lots of requests for Jest in the CLI and even mocha. The different tools have their trade-offs and even though `karma` allows real browser testing it's often outperformed by `jest`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nMeet developers where they are and enable them to use the unit testing framework they want. Remove `karma` by default and instead change `ng test` to output a list of available and supported options, such as `karma` and `jest`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to `ng e2e` and `ng deploy` we can recommend solutions which have high adoption and are maintained by the owner of the testing tool to provide guarantees for higher reliability. \r\n\r\nA challenge with this approach is that it gets harder to automatically generate a unit test for every generated component/directive/component/pipe. We'd like to enable testing vendors to plug into the corresponding generator so they can provide a template that we can use in `ng generate` to produce a dummy unit test.\r\n\r\nThat's the open question as of right now, which will unblock us to provide flexibility while continuing to enforce best practices.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23734","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable developers to select a unit testing framework\" (#23734)"},{"Id":"1336332987","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T20:01:45","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23731","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: re add `test-browsers` step","State":"closed","Body":"This was deleted by mistake","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23731","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: re add `test-browsers` step\" (#23731)"},{"Id":"1336070729","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T17:00:50","Actor":"e-oz","Number":"23729","RawContent":null,"Title":"RxJS 8 support","State":"closed","Body":"# 🚀 Feature request\r\nPlease modify the code to support RxJS version 8\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request?

it were found in the project (some in the `node_modules`).\r\n\r\nThe odd thing is: It is not working on my dev platform `OS: win32 x64`, but working on GitLab CI `OS: linux x64`\r\n\r\nI tried to update as best as possible, mostly using https://update.angular.io/ , release notes and migration guides (https://v11.angular.io/guide/updating-to-version-11 + https://v12.angular.io/guide/updating-to-version-12).\r\nMaybe I forgot something ?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands

[`v0.15.1`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0151)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1)\n\n-   Update esbuild's Yarn Plug'n'Play implementation to match the latest specification changes ([#&#8203;2452](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2452), [#&#8203;2453](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2453))\n\n    This release updates esbuild's implementation of Yarn Plug'n'Play to match some changes to Yarn's specification that just landed. The changes are as follows:\n\n    -   Check for platform-specific absolute paths instead of always for the `/` prefix\n\n        The specification previously said that Yarn Plug'n'Play path resolution rules should not apply for paths that start with `/`. The intent was to avoid accidentally processing absolute paths. However, absolute paths on Windows such as `C:\\project` start with drive letters instead of with `/`. So the specification was changed to instead explicitly avoid processing absolute paths.\n\n    -   Make `$$virtual` an alias for `__virtual__`\n\n        Supporting Yarn-style path resolution requires implementing a custom Yarn-specific path traversal scheme where certain path segments are considered no-ops. Specifically any path containing segments of the form `__virtual__/<whatever>/<n>` where `<n>` is an integer must be treated as if they were `n` times the `..` operator instead (the `<whatever>` path segment is ignored). So `/path/to/project/__virtual__/xyz/2/foo.js` maps to the underlying file `/path/to/project/../../foo.js`. This scheme makes it possible for Yarn to get node (and esbuild) to load the same file multiple times (which is sometimes required for correctness) without actually duplicating the file on the file system.\n\n        However, old versions of Yarn used to use `$$virtual` instead of `__virtual__`. This was changed because `$$virtual` was error-prone due to the use of the `$` character, which can cause bugs when it's not correctly escaped within regular expressions. Now that esbuild makes `$$virtual` an alias for `__virtual__`, esbuild should now work with manifests from these old Yarn versions.\n\n    -   Ignore PnP manifests in virtual directories\n\n        The specification describes the algorithm for how to find the Plug'n'Play manifest when starting from a certain point in the file system: search through all parent directories in reverse order until the manifest is found. However, this interacts poorly with virtual paths since it can end up finding a virtual copy of the manifest instead of the original. To avoid this, esbuild now ignores manifests in virtual directories so that the search for the manifest will continue and find the original manifest in another parent directory later on.\n\n    These fixes mean that esbuild's implementation of Plug'n'Play now matches Yarn's implementation more closely, and esbuild can now correctly build more projects that use Plug'n'Play.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.10.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4100-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev493v4100-2022-08-10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.3...v4.10.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   allow to configure more `client` options via resource URL ([#&#8203;4274](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4274)) ([216e3cb](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/216e3cbe62dc90b9345995cb4f33ca9dd7b6aaba))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   response correctly when receive an OPTIONS request ([#&#8203;4185](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4185)) ([2b3b7e0](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/2b3b7e000f688e086c68ba821ed2edc3cd56a219))\n\n##### [4.9.3](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.2...v4.9.3) (2022-06-29)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   avoid creation unnecessary stream for static sockjs file ([#&#8203;4482](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4482)) ([049b153](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/049b153b87ab908ae53b71356e0716bb3fc5bf07))\n-   history-api-fallback now supports HEAD requests and handles them the same as GET ([8936082](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/8936082809a9575f231afbcad6a32bb8e14d6dce))\n\n##### [4.9.2](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.1...v4.9.2) (2022-06-06)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   add `@types/serve-static` to dependencies ([#&#8203;4468](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4468)) ([af83deb](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/af83deb199dc1d8cae4365ec2c5acf07e29358df))\n\n##### [4.9.1](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.9.0...v4.9.1) (2022-05-31)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   security problem with sockjs ([#&#8203;4465](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/4465)) ([e765182](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/e765182e426cbca9c3c09294b02ac2d9737c1d74))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I use the \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\" with the Webpack CompressionPlugin, because i want my build files being compressed. To not have the compressed and uncompressed files in the dist directory, the 'deleteOriginalAssets' property is set to true. But the @angular-devkit/build-angular module wants to calculate the statistics and needs the deleted files. In version 9 it just returns 0 for the sizes. Now the build process breaks because in line 175 in the file @angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/plugins/analytics.js the property firstFile is undefined.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Set up a new project with angular cli (no routing, css)\r\n`ng new repro-app`\r\n3. Add in package.json in \"devDependencies\": \r\n```\r\n\"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\":\"^14.0.0\",\r\n\"compression-webpack-plugin\":\"^10.0.0\",\r\n```\r\n5. Add a new file in root directory called 'extra-webpack.config.js' \r\n6. Write this code into 'extra-webpack.config.js': \r\n```\r\nconst CompressionPlugin = require(\"compression-webpack-plugin\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    plugins: [\r\n        new CompressionPlugin({\r\n            deleteOriginalAssets: true,\r\n        })\r\n    ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n7. In angular.json change the builder in build to `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser`\r\n8. Add the option in build:             \r\n```\r\n\"customWebpackConfig\": {\r\n              \"path\": \"./extra-webpack.config.js\"\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n9. Run `npm i`\r\n10. Try to run `npm run build` -> you will see an error\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n`An unhandled exception occurred: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'endsWith')`\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nFor a quick fix i just changed the line 175 in node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/plugins/analytics.js from this:\r\n`if (firstFile.endsWith('.css')) {`\r\nto this: \r\n`if (firstFile && firstFile.endsWith('.css')) {`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23717","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'endsWith')\" (#23717)"},{"Id":"1334351427","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-10T13:55:19","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23719","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): avoid collect stats from chunks with no files","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis commit updates to bundle stats logic to skip checking chunks with no files.\r\n\r\nCloses #23717","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23719","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): avoid collect stats from chunks with no files\" (#23719)"},{"Id":"1334329772","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-10T09:20:48","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23718","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): add builders and schematic names as page titles in collected analytics","State":"open","Body":"With this commit the builder and schematic names are added as page title to page events.\r\n\r\nAlso, we address a bug where during a watch or error in some cases analytics where not flushed.

That has its pros and cons. It's great, but regardless of it, there are several issues to be solved. Especially when it comes to module development. Mainly it's about build size, traffic and performance. This issue is about collecting ideas and finding a good solution. Let be begin and explain in the following case: \r\n\r\nDeveloping an Angular app with lazy loaded modules (routing / loadChildrean) is great and using modules the way to go. But using the Angular Material components bloats the build size. Even if you don't use a shared material module. For example, if you have 10 components with it's own module, and every component uses the mat-card, mat-button or whatever. This means that the build size includes 10 times the same components. This should be avoided. But how? Avoiding modules in my app? Maybe there is a way in Angular. But Idk. Some devs create a shared module which contains all material components / modules. And importing it in every app module. In general, you'll use nearly all components of an framework in an app. This issue is about finding a way to load Material once for the whole app.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nReduce build size and traffic. Improve performance and usability. \r\n\r\n### More information\r\n\r\nYou can use the [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer)\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build --prod --stats-json && webpack-bundle-analyzer ./dist/demoapp/stats-es2015.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild a new app with routes and several modules. Lazy load routes with `loadChildren`.\r\n\r\nRelated trivia: In SCSS there are several ways to use other files. Either `@import` or `@use`. You should prefer `@use`. Because the file is only imported once. No matter how many times you use `@use` in your project. It's another point, don't be confused. This project already uses the right way. It's just a similar topic and the desired behavior of this framework in Angular at TS module level. I want to load Material only once. Having e.g. mat-card only one time in my build.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25432","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(framework): Allow loading framework once.\" (#25432)"},{"Id":"1335015725","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T09:41:01","Actor":"jacksonopp","Number":"25438","RawContent":null,"Title":"help(MatMenuHarness): MatMenuHarness.getItems() always returns 0 items","State":"closed","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\n\nUsing the `MatMenuHarness` seems to get the menu trigger, but does not seem to be able to interact with the actual menu.

We have noticed that the `handlePush` function of the service worker is parsing notifications in a non-standard way, which could lead to compatibility issues and maintain less maintainable code.\r\n\r\nThe current handlePush function has the following form:\r\n```\r\nasync handlePush(data) {\r\n    await this.broadcast({\r\n        type: \"PUSH\",\r\n        data\r\n    });\r\n    if (!data.notification || !data.notification.title) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n    const desc = data.notification;\r\n    let options = {};\r\n    NOTIFICATION_OPTION_NAMES.filter((name) => desc.hasOwnProperty(name)).forEach((name) => options[name] = desc[name]);\r\n    await this.scope.registration.showNotification(desc[\"title\"], options);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation uses a non-standard object structure for notifications and performs unnecessary checks.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe propose a more standardized way of handling push notifications in the `handlePush` function. Here is the proposed new implementation:\r\n```\r\nasync handlePush(data) {\r\n    await this.broadcast({\r\n        type: \"PUSH\",\r\n        data\r\n    });\r\n    if (!data || !data.title) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n    const desc = data;\r\n    let options = {};\r\n    NOTIFICATION_OPTION_NAMES.filter((name) => desc.hasOwnProperty(name)).forEach((name) => options[name] = desc[name]);\r\n    await this.scope.registration.showNotification(desc[\"title\"], options);\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThis new implementation eliminates the need to check for the existence of the \"notification\" key and simplifies the code.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51625","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problem with service worker in handling notifications\" (#51625)"},{"Id":"1877659411","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-01T15:50:10","Actor":"aleesaan","Number":"51624","RawContent":null,"Title":"Weird behavior of i18n-tagged strings with SSR","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nlocalize\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have an SSR app that uses `loadTranslations` to avoid building dist files for each locale. More specifically, I [bootstrap the language](https://github.com/aleesaan/angular-i18n-ssr/blob/main/src/app/services/language.service.ts) based on [the request's cookies or headers](https://github.com/aleesaan/angular-i18n-ssr/blob/main/src/app/services/transfer-state.server.service.ts).  \r\nThis works well with strings marked with `$localize`, they're always in the correct language ✨ However, for strings marked with `i18n` attributes, the server seems to generate the response once, and then use it for every response thereafter 😢   \r\n\r\nSo if I run the server, then request the app in French, I will get the first response in French, and then the app bootstraps in the browser, and everything is still in French, great! 🚀 \r\nBut! When I then switch to English, the first response will still be in French for strings marked with `i18n`! Then the app bootstraps, and everything is in English correctly. 🤔 \r\n\r\nYou can check this by pulling and running the [reproduction repo I created](https://github.com/aleesaan/angular-i18n-ssr), following the steps I described above and looking at the first response you get from the server. This happens every time you restart the server, it seems to cache the first response it serves (at least for strings marked with `i18n`).\r\n\r\nI've been trying to look in the source code but I don't understand this! Do you know how I can fix it?

Overview of the commits:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): computed for loop variables exposed on the wrong scope\r\nFixes that the computed for loop variables (e.g. $first and $last) were exposed on the parent scope instead of the for loop scope.\r\n\r\n### refactor(core): add instruction to reference component instance\r\nAdds an instruction that allows us to access the containing component instance directly instead of having to traverse the context tree. This will be necessary for the tracking function of `for` loop blocks.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): allow constants pool to track shared functions\r\nExpands the constant pool to be able to reuse function declarations that have identical bodies.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): add support for advanced tracking expressions\r\nThese changes build on top of https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51514 to add support for advanced expressions inside the `track` parameter of `for` loop blocks. There are two different outputs that the compiler can generate:\r\n\r\n1. If the tracking function only references the item or `$index`, the compiler generates a pure arrow function as a constant references in the `repeaterCreate` instruction.\r\n2. If the tracking function has references to properties outside of the `for` loop block, the compiler will rewrite those references to go through `this` and generate a function declaration. The runtime will `bind` the declaration to the current component instance so that the rewritten `this` references are resolved correctly.\r\n\r\nAdvanced tracking expression come with the following limitations to ensure the best possible performance:\r\n1. They can only reference the item, `$index` and properties directly on the component instance. This means that there'll be an error when accessing this like local template variables and references. While we could get this to work, we would have to traverse the context tree at runtime which will degrade the performance of the loop, because it's a linear time operation that is performed on each comparison. Furthermore, allowing local references would require us re-evaluate the list when any one of them has changed.\r\n2. Pipes aren't allowed inside the tracking function.\r\n3. Object literals and pipes used inside the tracking expression will be recreated on each invocation.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/51618","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Advanced for loop tracking expressions support and bug fixes\" (#51618)"},{"Id":"1877179302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-01T10:39:07","Actor":"Vic-rider","Number":"51616","RawContent":null,"Title":"add link validators { Validators } from '@angular/forms';","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nSometimes we need to control an input that will contain a link.

`true`. This causes CSS of components to be removed from the DOM when destroyed. You retain the previous behaviour by providing the `REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY` injection token.\n\n    ```ts\n    import {REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY} from '@&#8203;angular/platform-browser';\n    ...\n    providers: [{\n      provide: REMOVE_STYLES_ON_COMPONENT_DESTROY,\n      useValue: false,\n    }]\n    ```\n\n##### router\n\n-   The following Router properties have been removed from\n    the public API:\n\n    -   canceledNavigationResolution\n    -   paramsInheritanceStrategy\n    -   titleStrategy\n    -   urlUpdateStrategy\n    -   malformedUriErrorHandler\n\n    These should instead be configured through the `provideRouter` or\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` APIs.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [698c058e1c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/698c058e1c975c573722407f4843a4a774ceb92a) | fix | remove code duplication between entry-points ([#&#8203;51500](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51500)) |\n| [18be804c03](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/18be804c038e8d81a60c9a72521cfa640c8a1d5a) | fix | remove unnecessary escaping in regex expressions ([#&#8203;51554](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51554)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [86c5e34601](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/86c5e34601d7901a11688124aa902646524177eb) | fix | remove code duplication between entry-points ([#&#8203;51500](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51500)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [de2550d988](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/de2550d9886394e1ecde586d72bf2bab5b65cb39) | fix | correct incomplete escaping ([#&#8203;51557](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51557)) |\n| [3bca9db4a5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3bca9db4a56d61ac22b4ce87591d8862606177c8) | fix | remove unnecessary escaping in regex expressions ([#&#8203;51554](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51554)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [dbffdc09c2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/dbffdc09c25c93868aa13ae368c9fd21a4c359fb) | fix | avoid duplicated code between entry-points (primary, testing, rxjs-interop) ([#&#8203;51500](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51500)) |\n| [45d2ded0ea](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/45d2ded0ea9ef414948256099f8dc9c4598fdc2b) | fix | correct incomplete escaping ([#&#8203;51557](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51557)) |\n| [006577f39c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/006577f39c0e46e37491e44687142521fe7fab54) | fix | handle hydration of view containers that use component hosts as anchors ([#&#8203;51456](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51456)) |\n| [1423bfbf8f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/1423bfbf8ffa3b43d0dea41054c8f950e669a697) | fix | remove unnecessary escaping in regex expressions ([#&#8203;51554](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51554)) |\n| [3a19d6b743](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3a19d6b7437e1812ae70b3784fd6a8a185b330b1) | fix | run afterRender callbacks outside of the Angular zone ([#&#8203;51385](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51385)) |\n| [685d01e106](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/685d01e1065dad6dc52eaac9eb9527100994f5ce) | perf | chain template instructions ([#&#8203;51546](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51546)) |\n\n##### language-service\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [88b1575271](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/88b157527172d70ed3e5aa11aa8b7963a8612e49) | fix | correct incomplete escaping ([#&#8203;51557](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51557)) |\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [c340d6e044](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c340d6e0440bd982dff6f9f4f4229931c62d2c08) | feat | enable removal of styles on component destroy by default ([#&#8203;51571](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51571)) |\n| [c5daa6ce77](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c5daa6ce776724d44c02cc97f1a349a85cb2a819) | feat | expose `EventManagerPlugin` in the public API.

Single toggle button instances are meeting accessibility requirements because they have a change in text or icon in addition to color.\r\n\r\nSee WCAG context below:\r\n\r\nWCAG [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast): “This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast.” \r\nThis success criterion is met, but is only applicable to the default (un-selected) state.\r\n\r\nWCAG [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast): Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.\r\nThis is not being met. \r\n\r\nWCAG [Use of color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color): If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue, but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors leads to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.\r\nThis implies that a design solution that meets 3:1 contrast is sufficient in meeting the “Use of Color” success criterion.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis issue can be reproduced in the component demo and does not require StackBlitz: https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle/overview\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe contrast ratio of the selected state must meet at least 3:1 to fulfill WCAG success criterion for non-text contrast and use of color.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCurrently the selected state of mat-button-toggle-group uses a fill color of #E0E0E0. On an #FFFFFF background, the contrast ratio is only 1.32:1. \n\n### Environment\n\nAngular/Material 16.2.1\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27748","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button-toggle-group): Accessibility issue of WCAG non-text contrast and WCAG use of color\" (#27748)"},{"Id":"1875065745","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T15:10:20","Actor":"aanchal88","Number":"27746","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: omit repetitions","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/27746","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: omit repetitions\" (#27746)"},{"Id":"1875320398","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T11:15:53","Actor":"omerman","Number":"27747","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(BreakpointObserver): BreakpointObserver is either not performant enough or implementation is problematic","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using BreakpointObserver to set behaviors(props/style) to components it will often flicker on first reload especially once the window loads for the first time / when using ssr.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that using media queries for example will look perfect vs using BreakpointObserver to achieve the same things.\r\n\r\nIs there a plan to deal with that?\r\n\r\nThank you so much\r\n\r\n(If it looks like Im coming too strong, it's because it is frustrating, but really I do appreciate the hard work given on this framework)\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. generate this example on an angular project `ng generate @angular/material:navigation <component-name>`\r\n2. open browser with 400px size(width)\r\n3. refresh the example\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf you hide/show the relevant components using media query, it will just work. no flicker.\r\n\r\nI would expect it to just work smoothly, and if it's a caveat I would expect some sort of implemented behavior/way to help us overcome this. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nYou will see the component of the sidenav flicker for a second.\r\nAlso the simple nav button  will flicker\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: latest\r\n- CDK/Material: latest\r\n- Browser(s): chrome latest\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): mac\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27747","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(BreakpointObserver): BreakpointObserver is either not performant enough or implementation is problematic\" (#27747)"},{"Id":"1875062568","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T08:42:14","Actor":"Milad-Mohamadi","Number":"27745","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(mat-menu): Change menu item direction in RTL","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a bug in the Angular Material component where menu items did not update dynamically upon a direction change.

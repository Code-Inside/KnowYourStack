In this case the final registered logic wound up running before the applied logic.\r\n\r\nThis happened because `FieldPathNode` for a child path was caching its `LogicNodeBuilder` at creation time.

This option is runner-agnostic and enhances flexibility for both Vitest and Karma.\r\n\r\nThe option accepts a boolean or a string path:\r\n- `true`: Automatically searches for a default config file (`karma.conf.js` or `vitest.config.ts`). If not found, the runner will use its internal default configuration.\r\n- `false` (default): Disables the use of any external config file.\r\n- `path/to/config`: Uses the specified configuration file.\r\n\r\nFor Vitest, the loaded configuration is deep-merged with the system's programmatic config. This allows users to add or override advanced options (like `test.coverage`) while preserving the essential in-memory integration.

Open the StackBlitz link above\n2. Set the browser zoom to `110%` **(important)**\n3. Observe the `<textarea>` component with `cdkTextareaAutosize`\n4. Notice the CSS rule applied\n```css\ntextarea { line-height: 1.15 }\n```\n5.  Fill in three lines of text, e.g. using\n```\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n```\n6. Add one more character (`a`),\n    -> A scroll bar appears even though the text area expands correctly\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `textarea` should **never display a scrollbar** when autosizing is enabled, regardless of `line-height` precision.\n\nIt should fully expand to fit content, even when `line-height` includes decimal or sub-pixel values.\n\n<img width=\"225\" height=\"103\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab6a2276-c076-40d0-a1a9-b19570e8edaf\" />\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nA vertical scrollbar appears after the text fills exactly three lines and one additional character is entered.\n\nThe scrollbar is triggered despite autosizing correctly adjusting the height.\n\n<img width=\"225\" height=\"103\" alt=\"Image\"

For example:\n\n  ```yaml\n  onlyBuiltDependencies:\n    - nx@21.6.4 || 21.6.5\n    - esbuild@0.25.1\n  ```\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;10104](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10104).\n\n- Added support for exact versions in `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` [#&#8203;9985](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9985).\n\n  You can now list one or more specific versions that pnpm should allow to install, even if those versions don’t satisfy the maturity requirement set by `minimumReleaseAge`. For example:\n\n  ```yaml\n  minimumReleaseAge: 1440\n  minimumReleaseAgeExclude:\n    - nx@21.6.5\n    - webpack@4.47.0 || 5.102.1\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

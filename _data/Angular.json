Run `npm install` in the `11.2.10` directory. This will install Angular 11.2.10 and its dependencies.\r\n2. From that directory, run `ng build --prod`.\r\n3. Open the `styles` file that has been generated inside of the `www` directory. The following CSS should be in that file:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.ion-padding-start{padding-left:unset;-webkit-padding-start:16px;padding-inline-start:16px}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Run `npm install` in the `11.2.11` directory. This will install Angular 11.2.11 and its dependencies.\r\n5. From that directory, run `ng build --prod`.\r\n6. Open the `styles` file that has been generated inside of the `www` directory. The following CSS should be in that file:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.ion-padding-start{-webkit-padding-start:16px;padding-inline-start:16px;padding-left:unset}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Angular 11.2.11, I would expect that the ordering of my CSS is preserved as in Angular 11.2.10 and earlier.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Angular 11.2.11, my CSS is reordered when the app is compiled.\r\n\r\n### Other Info\r\n\r\nBecause of this reordering the \"ion-padding-start\" class no longer adds padding on the starting side of an element as expected. This is because `padding-left` is being modified after `padding-start` in Angular 11.2.11 even though the source CSS has `padding-left` being modified before `padding-start`.\r\n\r\nThis is impacting Ionic Framework applications (https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/23266)\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.2.11\r\nNode: 15.9.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.2.11\r\n... cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1102.11\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1102.11\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.2.11\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.2.11\r\n@schematics/angular             11.2.11\r\n@schematics/update              0.1102.11\r\nrxjs                            6.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.0.7\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20693","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"css being reordered in devkit 0.1102.11, causing styles to not work correctly\" (#20693)"},{"Id":"875143060","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-04T14:33:58","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"20686","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): only run `emitDecoratorMetadata` removal migration in safe workspaces","State":"closed","Body":"Removal of `emitDecoratorMetadata` might cause runtime errors on projects which don't use the Angular Compiler to compile TypeScript code and therefore dependent on Decorators metadata during runtime.

This is\r\nmore simple than all the effort we'd need to make the toolchain\r\ngeneration tool work (while it would also increase the amount\r\nof checked-in sources significantly; with more unused toolchains\r\nfor CPP or Java)\r\n\r\nSee: angular/angular#41767.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20684","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: use platform from shared dev-infra package for remote execution\" (#20684)"},{"Id":"872142039","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-03T16:15:46","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"20664","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular to 4c3e62e","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`93560dd` -> `4c3e62e`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fanimations//) |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`70a76b0` -> `9399dd5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcdk//) |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`df3062a` -> `d41d773`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcommon//) |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`8c5f552` -> `7ed3c7d`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcompiler//) |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`5e59f53` -> `e2124a2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcompiler-cli//) |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`1e8218d` -> `84f89ba`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcore//) |\n| [@angular/dev-infra-private](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-builds) | devDependencies | digest | [`2fe65cf` -> `00bbf3f`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fdev-infra-private//) |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`522c6a3` -> `bf54593`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fforms//) |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`23a11a2` -> `29ced7d`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2flanguage-service//) |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`607931f` -> `f2347ee`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2flocalize//) |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material2-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`6fb3579` -> `a0da8f6`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial//) |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`c68ac9d` -> `1811b0d`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial-moment-adapter//) |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`c79d76c` -> `0547d07`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fplatform-browser//) |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`b011e03` -> `914d219`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fplatform-browser-dynamic//) |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`aca74bc` -> `4499bde`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fplatform-server//) |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`f742898` -> `831d61f`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2frouter//) |\n\n:abcd: If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Here is the [code](https://github.com/ishowman/schematics) provide with `hello` command.\r\nWhen I want to generate codes in other project, schematics command `schematics <relativePath>:hello` requires me  to tell schematics the relative path(such as `schematics ../src:hello`). My expectation is that if I install the lib  as a dependency，I can generate find where to find the `hello` .\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli`  be able to run command once the project have installed lib with collection, without specifying relative path.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> For example,the structure of a project like:\r\n```\r\nProjectA\r\n|-- node_modules\r\n|    |-- schematics-lib-with-hello-collection\r\n|-- src\r\n|-- package.json\r\n```\r\nOnce I've installed `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` and  running `schematics hello` at the rootPath of ProjectA, it'll find the hello from the rootPath of ProjectA first.\r\nFor the rootPath of ProjectA do not have hello collection, it'll find it at `node_modules` next. For `schematics-lib-with-hello-collection` have provided `hello` collection, it'll generate code.\r\n\r\nBe grateful for reading.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20679","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[schematics-cli] support run command without relative path\" (#20679)"},{"Id":"874454289","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-03T10:38:24","Actor":"smasala","Number":"20680","RawContent":null,"Title":"Problem with \"Webpack 5\" & \"Module Federation\" & \"license-webpack-plugin\"","State":"closed","Body":"Because the other Issue is locked\r\n\r\nFix for https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20028 by @abadakhshan\r\n\r\nError\r\n```\r\nENOENT: no such file or directory, open '\\package.json'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n```\r\n\"resolutions\": {\r\n    \"webpack\": \"^5.0.0\",\r\n    \"license-webpack-plugin\": \"2.3.13\"\r\n  }\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/20680","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Problem with \"Webpack 5\" & \"Module Federation\" & \"license-webpack-plugin\"\" (#20680)"},{"Id":"873720264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-03T08:45:40","Actor":"maurei","Number":"20675","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve poor debugging experience in Visual Studio Code","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n#### Is this a regression?\r\nI don't think so\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n\r\nI have been unable to get a debugging experience going on the way I envision it.

I'm unsure of the exact reason, but I assume that Material is checking the ``selectionChange`` event's results (which are none) and doesn't know to update? Since I cannot rely on the results to be accurate from this ``selectionChange``, I am overriding this by setting the ``selected`` variable within the component with the correct selected results. As long as there is one checked box that is visible to the user, the Custom Trigger Text updates as expected.\r\n\r\nWhat are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nI would like to FORCE the Custom Trigger Text to show the correct selected results (even if it's not visible to the user due to filtering from search)\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nI have tried to research how to force this Custom Trigger to show the Selected results however I've been unsuccessful. \r\nI have found that others have tried to do something similar such as here --> https://github.com/angular/components/issues/7758\r\n\r\n#### What are you seeing that does not match your expectations? \r\n\r\nI would like to see the correct #of selected results in the Custom Trigger Text not the Placeholder (which should only show if there are 0 selected results)\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Code here on StackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-mat-select-multi-with-formcontrol-x2tbvo?file=app%2Fselect-search-dropdown.component.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

When the view is change-detected, the following function is used:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9a623c03b27e35f23d4834188880a9d669020e30/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts#L483-L505\r\nwhich is similar to the `detectChangesInternal` used elsewhere (for non-root views):\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9a623c03b27e35f23d4834188880a9d669020e30/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts#L1806-L1817\r\nThe mentioned functions are very similar, but they have one big difference: the function for non-root views reports errors to the ErrorHandler, when a root view one does not.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue in most cases, since there are other points at which the error is intercepted and reports. For example, this function is used during the bootstrap: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9a623c03b27e35f23d4834188880a9d669020e30/packages/core/src/application_ref.ts#L594.\r\nand also when an error happens in a listener:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9a623c03b27e35f23d4834188880a9d669020e30/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/listener.ts#L220\r\n\r\nHowever when an APIs like `createComponent` (and I suspect `ViewContainerRef.createComponent`) are used after the bootstrap and outside of listeners, errors would not be reported to the `ErrorHandler`. Here is a TestBed test to illustrate this:\r\n```\r\n   fit('should report errors to the ErrorHandler', () => {\r\n      @Component({\r\n        standalone: true,\r\n        template: '...',\r\n      })\r\n      class StandaloneComponent {\r\n        ngOnInit() {\r\n          throw new Error('!');\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      let errorHandlerInvoked = false;\r\n      const hostElement = document.createElement('div');\r\n      const parentInjector = TestBed.inject(EnvironmentInjector);\r\n      const errorHandler = {\r\n        handleError: () => {\r\n          errorHandlerInvoked = true;\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n      const providers = [\r\n        {provide: ErrorHandler, useValue: errorHandler},\r\n      ];\r\n      const environmentInjector = createEnvironmentInjector(providers, parentInjector);\r\n      const componentRef = createComponent(StandaloneComponent, {hostElement, environmentInjector});\r\n      expect(() => {\r\n        componentRef.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();\r\n      }).toThrow();\r\n\r\n      // This assert fails (ErrorHandler is never invoked):\r\n      expect(errorHandlerInvoked).toBe(true);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nIt's easy to add a logic to report errors:\r\n```\r\n--- a/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts\r\n+++ b/packages/core/src/render3/instructions/shared.ts\r\n@@ -497,6 +497,9 @@ export function renderComponentOrTemplate<T>(\r\n       renderView(tView, lView, context);\r\n     }\r\n     refreshView(tView, lView, templateFn, context);\r\n+  } catch (error) {\r\n+    handleError(lView, error);\r\n+    throw error;\r\n   } finally {\r\n     if (!checkNoChangesMode && !creationModeIsActive && rendererFactory.end) {\r\n       rendererFactory.end();\r\n```\r\nHowever this would have consequences for the mentioned cases (bootstrapping, event listeners invocation) and would result in reporting an error to the ErrorHandler twice. As a possible solution, we can probably mark (via monkey-patching) errors that we've reported and skip reporting it the second time.\r\n\r\nAnother API that would likely be affected: `TestBed.createComponent`.

While this is great for certain use cases, many RxJS use cases require us to consume the control state reactively.\r\n\r\nWhile working with NgRx, RxJS and Angular, we often still need \"regular\" observables, which automatically replay the latest state, whenever you subscribe to them. Additionally a lot of developers are searching for ways to bind to variables like `dirty`,  `invalid` reactively.\r\n\r\nWe were previously using the [`ngneat/reactive-forms`](https://github.com/ngneat/reactive-forms) which offered a great developer experience, by providing these additional observables to ease our lives.\r\n\r\nI'd be very happy to **contribute a solution** that simply operates on top of the existing `valueChanges` and `statusChanges` to make the API of the `AbstractControl` more accessible.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAddition of cold observables, which replay the latest value, whenever they are subscribed to:\r\n- `value$` Similar to `valueChanges` but emits on subscription the latest value.\r\n- `dirty$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `pristine$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\r\n- `touched$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `untouched$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\r\n- `enabled$`: Mirrors the enabled getter as an observable.\r\n- `disabled$`: Mirrors the disabled getter as an observable.\r\n- `valid$`:  Mirrors the dirty getter as an observable.\r\n- `invalid$`: Mirrors the pristine getter as an observable.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEvery dev can write their own set of helper functions to reactively select attributes from the `AbstractControl`:\r\n\r\n[Example App](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mwxdxl?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts,src%2Findex.html)\r\n```ts\r\nexport function selectFormValue<Value, RawValue extends Value>(\r\n  control: AbstractControl<Value, RawValue>\r\n): Observable<Value> {\r\n  return defer(() => control.valueChanges.pipe(startWith(control.value)));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47289","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Additional Observables for `AbstractControl`: `value$`, `dirty$`, `invalid$`, ...\" (#47289)"},{"Id":"1353864524","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T07:55:25","Actor":"kbrilla","Number":"47287","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reopen #27936 - Resolved data from parent is not available in child resolver ","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOriginal issue: #27936\r\n\r\nWhen there are 2 routes: child and parent, each has a resolved property, the data form the parent resolve is not available in child resolver (still available in ChildComponent though as expected)\r\n\r\n[Original Angular v6 repro](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-7xwxls?file=src%2Findex.html)\r\n[Actual Angualr v14 repro](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-4hynrm?file=src/app/app.module.ts)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n`data` parameter of `route` should follow `paramsInheritanceStrategy`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nThe resolve data from the parent can still be accessed as\r\n```\r\nclass ChildResolver {\r\n  resolve(route) {\r\n    const parentData = route.parent.data;\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nbut this looks like a hack","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47287","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reopen #27936 - Resolved data from parent is not available in child resolver \" (#47287)"},{"Id":"1353578272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T02:00:29","Actor":"kormide","Number":"47286","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(bazel): Fix a bug where the aio build artifact didn't include assets","State":"open","Body":"@devversion @josephperrott @gregmagolan \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In order to mix the incoming values, dev has to use some sort of ts helper that produces the literal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI would propose that Angular adopt a new array-based syntax for `[ngClass]`. The [`NgClassSupportedTypes`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/src/directives/ng_class.ts#L10) union would be extended by:\r\n\r\n`Array<string | Record<string, boolean | undefined | null>>`\r\n\r\nIn practice, dev would be able to provide an array of strings mixed with literals, depending on how a given css class is provided. Usage example:\r\n\r\n`[ngClass]=\"['fixed-class', input1, input2, {'flagged1': bool1, 'flagged2': bool2}, input3$ | async]\"`\r\n\r\nI think this syntax would reduce the code that today has to be handled by the TypeScript code (via getters, methods, HostBindings and whatnot), or get scattered over html and ts, thus making the code verbose and hardly manageable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, yes, certainly, workarounds exist, but they essentially produce overcomplicated and hardly maintainable code. The proposed syntax would consolidate css classes into one expression and move it close to the html element.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47279","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extended ngClass array syntax (allow strings and literals)\" (#47279)"},{"Id":"1352327112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-26T14:13:49","Actor":"vyom1611","Number":"47276","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor (forms): fix issue 24571 on radio-controls accessor in forms","State":"open","Body":"- Removes `!` from radio_control_value_accessor.ts from forms/src/directives in reference to issue #24571\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

[`v0.15.6`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0156)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.5...v0.15.6)\n\n-   Lower `for await` loops ([#&#8203;1930](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1930))\n\n    This release lowers `for await` loops to the equivalent `for` loop containing `await` when esbuild is configured such that `for await` loops are unsupported. This transform still requires at least generator functions to be supported since esbuild's lowering of `await` currently relies on generators. This new transformation is mostly modeled after what the TypeScript compiler does. Here's an example:\n\n    ```js\n    async function f() {\n      for await (let x of y)\n        x()\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The code above will now become the following code with `--target=es2017` (omitting the code for the `__forAwait` helper function):\n\n    ```js\n    async function f() {\n      try {\n        for (var iter = __forAwait(y), more, temp, error; more = !(temp = await iter.next()).done; more = false) {\n          let x = temp.value;\n          x();\n        }\n      } catch (temp) {\n        error = [temp];\n      } finally {\n        try {\n          more && (temp = iter.return) && await temp.call(iter);\n        } finally {\n          if (error)\n            throw error[0];\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Automatically fix invalid `supported` configurations ([#&#8203;2497](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2497))\n\n    The `--target=` setting lets you tell esbuild to target a specific version of one or more JavaScript runtimes such as `chrome80,node14` and esbuild will restrict its output to only those features supported by all targeted JavaScript runtimes. More recently, esbuild introduced the `--supported:` setting that lets you override which features are supported on a per-feature basis. However, this now lets you configure nonsensical things such as `--supported:async-await=false --supported:async-generator=true`. Previously doing this could result in esbuild building successfully but producing invalid output.\n\n    Starting with this release, esbuild will now attempt to automatically fix nonsensical feature override configurations by introducing more overrides until the configuration makes sense. So now the configuration from previous example will be changed such that `async-await=false` implies `async-generator=false`. The full list of implications that were introduced is below:\n\n    -   `async-await=false` implies:\n        -   `async-generator=false`\n        -   `for-await=false`\n        -   `top-level-await=false`\n\n    -   `generator=false` implies:\n        -   `async-generator=false`\n\n    -   `object-accessors=false` implies:\n        -   `class-private-accessor=false`\n        -   `class-private-static-accessor=false`\n\n    -   `class-field=false` implies:\n        -   `class-private-field=false`\n\n    -   `class-static-field=false` implies:\n        -   `class-private-static-field=false`\n\n    -   `class=false` implies:\n        -   `class-field=false`\n        -   `class-private-accessor=false`\n        -   `class-private-brand-check=false`\n        -   `class-private-field=false`\n        -   `class-private-method=false`\n        -   `class-private-static-accessor=false`\n        -   `class-private-static-field=false`\n        -   `class-private-static-method=false`\n        -   `class-static-blocks=false`\n        -   `class-static-field=false`\n\n-   Implement a small minification improvement ([#&#8203;2496](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2496))\n\n    Some people write code that contains a label with an immediate break such as `x: break x`. Previously this code was not removed during minification but it will now be removed during minification starting with this release.\n\n-   Fix installing esbuild via Yarn with `enableScripts: false` configured ([#&#8203;2457](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2457))\n\n    If esbuild is installed with Yarn with the `enableScripts: false` setting configured, then Yarn will not \"unplug\" the `esbuild` package (i.e. it will keep the entire package inside a `.zip` file). This messes with esbuild's library code that extracts the platform-specific binary executable because that code copies the binary executable into the esbuild package directory, and Yarn's `.zip` file system shim doesn't let you write to a directory inside of a `.zip` file. This release fixes this problem by writing to the `node_modules/.cache/esbuild` directory instead in this case. So you should now be able to use esbuild with Yarn when `enableScripts: false` is configured.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;jonaskuske](https://togithub.com/jonaskuske).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>microsoft/node-jsonc-parser</summary>\n\n### [`v3.2.0`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/node-jsonc-parser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;320-2022-08-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/microsoft/node-jsonc-parser/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)\n\n\\=================\n\n-   update the version of the bundled Javascript files to `es2020`.\n-   include all `const enum` values in the bundled JavaScript files (`ScanError`, `SyntaxKind`, `ParseErrorCode`).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.3`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0263-httpsgithubcomrich-harrismagic-stringcomparev0262v0263-2022-08-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.26.2...v0.26.3)\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   delay guess encoded ([#&#8203;216](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/216)) ([69b13c7](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/69b13c7a09af742e4f31cf419e8f96e6db32ab5a))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass</summary>\n\n### [`v1.54.6`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1546)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.54.5...1.54.6)\n\n-   Fix a bug where a `@media` query could be incorrectly omitted from a\n    stylesheet if it had multiple levels of nested `@media` queries within it\n    *and* the inner queries were mergeable but the outer query was not.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.10.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4101-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev4100v4101-2022-08-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.10.0...v4.10.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The scripts tag (for runtime, polyfills and main) in the index.html are missing. \r\n\r\nI use the \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\" with the Webpack CompressionPlugin. To not have the compressed and uncompressed files in the dist directory, the 'deleteOriginalAssets' property is set to true. If 'deleteOriginalAssets' is set to false, the build is working fine.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Set up a new project with angular cli (no routing, css)\r\n`ng new repro-app`\r\n3. Add in package.json in \"devDependencies\": \r\n```\r\n\"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\":\"^14.0.1\",\r\n\"compression-webpack-plugin\":\"^10.0.0\",\r\n```\r\n5. Add a new file in root directory called 'extra-webpack.config.js' \r\n6. Write this code into 'extra-webpack.config.js': \r\n```\r\nconst CompressionPlugin = require(\"compression-webpack-plugin\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    plugins: [\r\n        new CompressionPlugin({\r\n            deleteOriginalAssets: true,\r\n        })\r\n    ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n7. In angular.json change the builder in build to `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser`\r\n8. Add the option in build:             \r\n```\r\n\"customWebpackConfig\": {\r\n              \"path\": \"./extra-webpack.config.js\"\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n9. Run `npm i`\r\n10. Run `npm run build`\r\n11. In the dist directory you will see the zipped files and the index.html with missing scripts tag. (Running npm run build with deleteOriginalAssets set to false, the index.html is fine).\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe script tags in index.html are missing:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<script src=\"runtime.dd33940cddb71537.js\" type=\"module\">\r\n</script><script src=\"polyfills.240ce46083334aa2.js\" type=\"module\">\r\n</script><script src=\"main.bed6caf36cdc29a3.js\" type=\"module\"></script>\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23817","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build not working correctly with CompressionWebpackPlugin and property 'deleteOriginalAssets'\" (#23817)"},{"Id":"1353992278","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T23:38:19","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"23816","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency puppeteer to v17","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [puppeteer](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) | devDependencies | major | [`16.2.0` -> `17.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/puppeteer/16.2.0/17.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer</summary>\n\n### [`v17.0.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1700-httpsgithubcompuppeteerpuppeteercomparev1620v1700-2022-08-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v16.2.0...v17.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   remove `root` from `WaitForSelectorOptions` ([#&#8203;8848](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8848))\n-   internalize execution context ([#&#8203;8844](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8844))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   allow multiple navigations to happen in LifecycleWatcher ([#&#8203;8826](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8826)) ([341b669](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/341b669a5e45ecbb9ffb0f28c45b520660f27ad2)), closes [#&#8203;8811](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8811)\n-   internalize execution context ([#&#8203;8844](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8844)) ([2f33237](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/2f33237d0443de77d58dca4454b0c9a1d2b57d03))\n-   remove `root` from `WaitForSelectorOptions` ([#&#8203;8848](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8848)) ([1155c8e](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/1155c8eac85b176c3334cc3d98adfe7d943dfbe6))\n-   remove deferred promise timeouts ([#&#8203;8835](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8835)) ([202ffce](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/202ffce0aa4f34dba35fbb8e7d740af16efee35f)), closes [#&#8203;8832](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/8832)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

css file though, it doesn't put the @media queries from the external.css in the `@layer external` block.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nConsider **main.css* being the angular app's main css file and external.css a CSS file imported from an external package.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* external.css */\r\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\r\n  .import {\r\n    background: darkgray;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n[data-theme=\"import-dark\"] {\r\n  background: black;\r\n  color: white;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* main.css */\r\n@import url('external.css') layer(external);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiling the angular app should result in the following CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* expected-output.css */\r\n@layer external {\r\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\r\n    .import {\r\n      background: darkgray;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  [data-theme=\"import-dark\"] {\r\n    background: black;\r\n    color: white;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual output however is the following:\r\n```css\r\n/* wrong-output.css */\r\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\r\n  .import {\r\n    background: darkgray;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n@layer external {\r\n

after the content. Blank space is not there when there are only a couple of items on the list however when we have a huge list it's possible to have it.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have a list with  <cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport autosize> and map some extendable card items in it.\r\n2. Have a long list and scroll till the end. You will see there is a blank viewport at the end with no context.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo blank area after the content. autosize should stop expanding the viewport height after arriving at the last  list item on the list.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nblank area after the content and height changes after every up and down scroll. \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 13.2.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 13.3.9\r\n- Browser(s): Safari/ Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows/ macOS\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25555","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport): autosize miscalculates and adds a blank space after scroll list\" (#25555)"},{"Id":"1355275212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-30T07:07:48","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25554","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/legacy-form-field): remove invalid selector","State":"open","Body":"We used to use `:placeholder-shown` to toggle some styles in the form field.

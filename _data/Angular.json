When both are provided (using two separate `[ngClass]` inputs - one with strings, the other with literal) - only one is rendered. In order to mix the incoming values, dev has to use some sort of ts helper that produces the literal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI would propose that Angular adopt a new array-based syntax for `[ngClass]`. The [`NgClassSupportedTypes`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/common/src/directives/ng_class.ts#L10) union would be extended by:\r\n\r\n`Array<string | Record<string, boolean | undefined | null>>`\r\n\r\nIn practice, dev would be able to provide an array of strings mixed with literals, depending on how a given css class is provided. Usage example:\r\n\r\n`[ngClass]=\"['fixed-class', input1, input2, {'flagged1': bool1, 'flagged2': bool2}, input3$ | async]\"`\r\n\r\nI think this syntax would reduce the code that today has to be handled by the TypeScript code (via getters, methods, HostBindings and whatnot), or get scattered over html and ts, thus making the code verbose and hardly manageable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, yes, certainly, workarounds exist, but they essentially produce overcomplicated and hardly maintainable code. The proposed syntax would consolidate css classes into one expression and move it close to the html element.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47279","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extended ngClass array syntax (allow strings and literals)\" (#47279)"},{"Id":"1351905102","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-26T16:46:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"47270","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to TypeScript 4.8 final","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps up to the final version of TS 4.8 and removes some workarounds.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/47270","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to TypeScript 4.8 final\" (#47270)"},{"Id":"1351911410","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-26T16:44:34","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"47271","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): replace most usages of getMutableClone (#47167)","State":"closed","Body":"This is a cherry-pick of #47167 into the patch branch.\r\n\r\nReplaces (almost) all of the usages of the deprecated `getMutableClone` function from TypeScript which has started to log deprecation warnings in version 4.8 and will likely be removed in version 5.0.

This behavior could cause memory leaks in an app.\r\n\r\nFor example in [`withTypeAhead`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/8504c7761f4fb334753e8ec4d8624ad85f071444/src/cdk/a11y/key-manager/list-key-manager.ts#L142) method, there is a call of `this._typeaheadSubscription.unsubscribe();`, but it works only for the previous subscription when call this method couple of times:\r\n- some component calls for the first time `withTypeAhead()`, a subscription is created\r\n- when it calls it for the second time, the subscription from the previous step is unsubscribed, and subscribed one more time\r\n- after the component is destroyed, the last subscription will still be in the memory\r\n\r\nAlso, the same subscription issue is in the constructor\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/8504c7761f4fb334753e8ec4d8624ad85f071444/src/cdk/a11y/key-manager/list-key-manager.ts#L68\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open [src/cdk/a11y/key-manager/list-key-manager.ts](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/e63390c712b8e66b81b6f026dcfd313c0fb3a682/src/cdk/a11y/key-manager/list-key-manager.ts)\r\n2. In the method [`withTypeAhead`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/8504c7761f4fb334753e8ec4d8624ad85f071444/src/cdk/a11y/key-manager/list-key-manager.ts#L142) after `this._typeaheadSubscription.unsubscribe();` add some logging (`console.log('LIST KEY MANAGER subscribed')`) \r\n3. Pass the third argument to `subscribe` function like `() => console.log('LISTKEYMANAGER unsubscribed')`\r\n4. Run any test which uses `ListKeyManager`, for example `arn test src/cdk/a11y --debug` or `yarn test src/cdk/menu --debug`\r\n\r\nAfter adding logs [`withTypeAhead`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/8504c7761f4fb334753e8ec4d8624ad85f071444/src/cdk/a11y/key-manager/list-key-manager.ts#L142) could look like this:\r\n```\r\nwithTypeAhead(debounceInterval: number = 200): this {\r\n  if (\r\n    (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode) &&\r\n    this._items.length &&\r\n    this._items.some(item => typeof item.getLabel !== 'function')\r\n  ) {\r\n    throw Error('ListKeyManager items in typeahead mode must implement the `getLabel` method.');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  this._typeaheadSubscription.unsubscribe();\r\n  console.log('LIST KEY MANAGER subscribed');\r\n\r\n  // Debounce the presses of non-navigational keys, collect the ones that correspond to letters\r\n  // and convert those letters back into a string.

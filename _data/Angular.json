Some icons appear to be replaced with the name of these icons when the page is translated. Apparently it's all over the site, I'll be attaching two images to the afterContentInit page to exemplify and better explain the error.\r\n\r\nObviously it is not something that affects the functioning of the site, I believe, however, I believe that for some developers who speak Portuguese regardless of the country, for example I am from Brazil, their understanding of the content may be affected by these errors, especially if they are more beginners in this vast universe of Angular Framework. In particular, this doesn't affect me in my reading and studies of Angular but I believe it could affect other users.

an input with a custom validator and I send a signal into it.\r\nInside the validator, I get that value and use it in my validate function. \r\n\r\nThe validate function is only called when the input value that has the validator changes, but doesn't when the \"entregaName\" value changes. I understand that maybe this is not the correct way of doing it, however it's what seems common sense.\r\n\r\nMy use case is I want to validate an input whenever the users click a button. I can't use async validators because they would fire each time.\r\n\r\nIn the past I've used the hack of adding a space to the input and then deleting the space with a settimeout, thus activating the validation function, aswell as adding or removing errors from the control programatically, but it doesn't seem like the proper way of doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/123938331/951abd8c-160b-4f5f-bda3-8a6b041e8d8a)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/123938331/70989be9-79c9-459b-9b8e-864e5b332390)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.3.5\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.5.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.3.5\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, google-maps, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1703.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular             17.3.5\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55730","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Custom Validator Directive won't fire when signal changes\" (#55730)"},{"Id":"2285315085","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-08T11:01:21","Actor":"serpent5","Number":"55729","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Update lifecycle.md","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/55729","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: Update lifecycle.md\" (#55729)"},{"Id":"2285232052","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-08T10:18:01","Actor":"ducin","Number":"55728","RawContent":null,"Title":"devtools injector tree tab \"hide injectors with no providers\" filtering incorrectly","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ndevtools\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nit should be showing `Root` injector as it does have providers, but only platform gets shown.\r\n\r\n[Best see this video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m46wzuyodw).\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducin/angular-bug-repros/blob/devtools-injector-tree-tab-repro\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nangular v17.3.4\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55728","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"devtools injector tree tab \"hide injectors with no providers\" filtering incorrectly\" (#55728)"},{"Id":"2285191970","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-08T09:57:01","Actor":"ducin","Number":"55727","RawContent":null,"Title":"devtools signal lookup incorrectly displays signal with empty string","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nDevtools\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<img width=\"373\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/375027/9d9455e9-cf2b-47e5-997f-ececbcbc5e32\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\njust put this on a component:\r\n`value = signal('')`\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n`@angular/core@17.3.4`\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/55727","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"devtools signal lookup incorrectly displays signal with empty string\" (#55727)"},{"Id":"2284737105","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-08T05:53:28","Actor":"sheariley","Number":"55725","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hello world tutorial is broken in several ways","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nIt appears that the current release of the hello world tutorial has a TON of issues; from parts of code snippets being missing in the step-by-step instructions, to missing files (package.json, etc...) in the downloaded zip files.

[`v0.21.0`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0210)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.20.2...v0.21.0)\n\nThis release doesn't contain any deliberately-breaking changes. However, it contains a very complex new feature and while all of esbuild's tests pass, I would not be surprised if an important edge case turns out to be broken. So I'm releasing this as a breaking change release to avoid causing any trouble. As usual, make sure to test your code when you upgrade.\n\n-   Implement the JavaScript decorators proposal ([#&#8203;104](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/104))\n\n    With this release, esbuild now contains an implementation of the upcoming [JavaScript decorators proposal](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-decorators). This is the same feature that shipped in [TypeScript 5.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#decorators) and has been highly-requested on esbuild's issue tracker. You can read more about them in that blog post and in this other (now slightly outdated) extensive blog post here: https://2ality.com/2022/10/javascript-decorators.html. Here's a quick example:\n\n    ```js\n    const log = (fn, context) => function() {\n      console.log(`before ${context.name}`)\n      const it = fn.apply(this, arguments)\n      console.log(`after ${context.name}`)\n      return it\n    }\n\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;log static foo() {\n        console.log('in foo')\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Logs \"before foo\", \"in foo\", \"after foo\"\n    Foo.foo()\n    ```\n\n    Note that this feature is different than the existing \"TypeScript experimental decorators\" feature that esbuild already implements. It uses similar syntax but behaves very differently, and the two are not compatible (although it's sometimes possible to write decorators that work with both). TypeScript experimental decorators will still be supported by esbuild going forward as they have been around for a long time, are very widely used, and let you do certain things that are not possible with JavaScript decorators (such as decorating function parameters). By default esbuild will parse and transform JavaScript decorators, but you can tell esbuild to parse and transform TypeScript experimental decorators instead by setting `\"experimentalDecorators\": true` in your `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n    Probably at least half of the work for this feature went into creating a test suite that exercises many of the proposal's edge cases: https://github.com/evanw/decorator-tests. It has given me a reasonable level of confidence that esbuild's initial implementation is acceptable. However, I don't have access to a significant sample of real code that uses JavaScript decorators. If you're currently using JavaScript decorators in a real code base, please try out esbuild's implementation and let me know if anything seems off.\n\n    **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**\n\n    This proposal has been in the works for a very long time (work began around 10 years ago in 2014) and it is finally getting close to becoming part of the JavaScript language. However, it's still a work in progress and isn't a part of JavaScript yet, so keep in mind that any code that uses JavaScript decorators may need to be updated as the feature continues to evolve. The decorators proposal is pretty close to its final form but it can and likely will undergo some small behavioral adjustments before it ends up becoming a part of the standard. If/when that happens, I will update esbuild's implementation to match the specification. I will not be supporting old versions of the specification.\n\n-   Optimize the generated code for private methods\n\n    Previously when lowering private methods for old browsers, esbuild would generate one `WeakSet` for each private method. This mirrors similar logic for generating one `WeakSet` for each private field. Using a separate `WeakMap` for private fields is necessary as their assignment can be observable:\n\n    ```js\n    let it\n    class Bar {\n      constructor() {\n        it = this\n      }\n    }\n    class Foo extends Bar {\n      #x = 1\n      #y = null.foo\n      static check() {\n        console.log(#x in it, #y in it)\n      }\n    }\n    try { new Foo } catch {}\n    Foo.check()\n    ```\n\n    This prints `true false` because this partially-initialized instance has `#x` but not `#y`. In other words, it's not true that all class instances will always have all of their private fields. However, the assignment of private methods to a class instance is not observable. In other words, it's true that all class instances will always have all of their private methods. This means esbuild can lower private methods into code where all methods share a single `WeakSet`, which is smaller, faster, and uses less memory. Other JavaScript processing tools such as the TypeScript compiler already make this optimization. Here's what this change looks like:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      #x() { return this.#x() }\n      #y() { return this.#y() }\n      #z() { return this.#z() }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (--supported:class-private-method=false)\n    var _x, x_fn, _y, y_fn, _z, z_fn;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _x);\n        __privateAdd(this, _y);\n        __privateAdd(this, _z);\n      }\n    }\n    _x = new WeakSet();\n    x_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _x, x_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    _y = new WeakSet();\n    y_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _y, y_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    _z = new WeakSet();\n    z_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _z, z_fn).call(this);\n    };\n\n    // New output (--supported:class-private-method=false)\n    var _Foo_instances, x_fn, y_fn, z_fn;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __privateAdd(this, _Foo_instances);\n      }\n    }\n    _Foo_instances = new WeakSet();\n    x_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, x_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    y_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, y_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    z_fn = function() {\n      return __privateMethod(this, _Foo_instances, z_fn).call(this);\n    };\n    ```\n\n-   Fix an obscure bug with lowering class members with computed property keys\n\n    When class members that use newer syntax features are transformed for older target environments, they sometimes need to be relocated. However, care must be taken to not reorder any side effects caused by computed property keys. For example, the following code must evaluate `a()` then `b()` then `c()`:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {\n      [a()]() {}\n      [b()];\n      static { c() }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Previously esbuild did this by shifting the computed property key *forward* to the next spot in the evaluation order. Classes evaluate all computed keys first and then all static class elements, so if the last computed key needs to be shifted, esbuild previously inserted a static block at start of the class body, ensuring it came before all other static class elements:\n\n    ```js\n    var _a;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      static {\n        _a = b();\n      }\n      [a()]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However, this could cause esbuild to accidentally generate a syntax error if the computed property key contains code that isn't allowed in a static block, such as an `await` expression. With this release, esbuild fixes this problem by shifting the computed property key *backward* to the previous spot in the evaluation order instead, which may push it into the `extends` clause or even before the class itself:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      [a()]() {}\n      [await b()];\n      static { c() }\n    }\n\n    // Old output (with --supported:class-field=false)\n    var _a;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      static {\n        _a = await b();\n      }\n      [a()]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n\n    // New output (with --supported:class-field=false)\n    var _a, _b;\n    class Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        __publicField(this, _a);\n      }\n      [(_b = a(), _a = await b(), _b)]() {\n      }\n      static {\n        c();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Fix some `--keep-names` edge cases\n\n    The [`NamedEvaluation` syntax-directed operation](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-namedevaluation) in the JavaScript specification gives certain anonymous expressions a `name` property depending on where they are in the syntax tree. For example, the following initializers convey a `name` value:\n\n    ```js\n    var foo = function() {}\n    var bar = class {}\n    console.log(foo.name, bar.name)\n    ```\n\n    When you enable esbuild's `--keep-names` setting, esbuild generates additional code to represent this `NamedEvaluation` operation so that the value of the `name` property persists even when the identifiers are renamed (e.g. due to minification).\n\n    However, I recently learned that esbuild's implementation of `NamedEvaluation` is missing a few cases. Specifically esbuild was missing property definitions, class initializers, logical-assignment operators. These cases should now all be handled:\n\n    ```js\n    var obj = { foo: function() {} }\n    class Foo0 { foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo1 { static foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo2 { accessor foo = function() {} }\n    class Foo3 { static accessor foo = function() {} }\n    foo ||= function() {}\n    foo &&= function() {}\n    foo ??= function() {}\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote (pacote)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.5`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1805-2024-05-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v18.0.4...v18.0.5)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`5e75582`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/5e755820b70f60ea136d9e85eb42a6c2d9718472) [#&#8203;368](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/368) dont set \\_contentLength if not in headers ([#&#8203;368](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/issues/368)) ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n-   [`1b6950b`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/1b6950b993f07f87cf66a0e4d76e646939174d88) [#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/365) move bin to its own directory ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n-   [`1b6950b`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/commit/1b6950b993f07f87cf66a0e4d76e646939174d88) [#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/pull/365) refactor: symbol cleanup ([#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/issues/365)) ([@&#8203;lukekarrys](https://togithub.com/lukekarrys))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>sass/dart-sass (sass)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.77.0`](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1770)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.76.0...1.77.0)\n\n-   *Don't* throw errors for at-rules in keyframe blocks.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Being able to provide them a single JS file has made it very easy to accommodate them.\r\n\r\nHowever the new builder splits our component into 13 JS files, none of which are actually lazy loaded, all are immediately requested on page load.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAn option to limit, or turn off, code splitting. The old `vendorChunk` barely made it possible to publish a single JS file, and required some slightly hacky post-processing. It would be nice if such an option was offered natively.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, code splitting is an option that was added later to esbuild, so I'd think it would be easy to _not_ do that.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWe tried to use the `browser-esbuild` builder, for the web-component projects but:\r\n\r\n> The 'vendorChunk' option is not used by this builder and will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe built application is still split across 13 JS files that cannot be concatenated into one working file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27601","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disable code splitting\" (#27601)"},{"Id":"2278742037","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-06T08:30:11","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"27598","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update all non-major dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [aspect_bazel_lib](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib) | http_archive | patch | `v2.7.1` -> `v2.7.2` |\n| [npm-pick-manifest](https://togithub.com/npm/npm-pick-manifest) | dependencies | patch | [`9.0.0` -> `9.0.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/npm-pick-manifest/9.0.0/9.0.1) |\n| [pacote](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote) | dependencies | patch | [`18.0.3` -> `18.0.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pacote/18.0.3/18.0.4) |\n| [pacote](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote) | devDependencies | patch | [`18.0.3` -> `18.0.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pacote/18.0.3/18.0.4) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>aspect-build/bazel-lib (aspect_bazel_lib)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.7.2`](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/releases/tag/v2.7.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/compare/v2.7.1...v2.7.2)\n\n#### Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6:\n\n1.

is different than the ripple container element (a trigger element can be set by using `matRippleTrigger` input), `clientX` and `clientY` are _outside_ the container dom rect.\r\n\r\n**Expeded behavior**\r\n\r\nIn case where the trigger element is different than the ripple container element, using `clientX` and `clientY` properties and calculating an equivalent point in the container element before calling `RippleRender::fadeInRipple`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-gtvxae\r\n\r\n* The div \"Ripple Container\" is the ripple container: `<div matRipple matRippleRadius=\"10\" [matRippleTrigger]=\"trigger\"></div>`\r\n* The \"Trigger Ripple\" button is the ripple trigger: `<button #trigger>Trigger Button</button>`\r\n* When \"Trigger Ripple\" button is clicked, the ripple element (red dot in screenshot below) is positionned outside the ripple container dom rect (the ripple element is positionned inside the trigger dom rect)\r\n* When \"Trigger Ripple with expected behavior\" button is clicked, the `clientX` and `clientY` properties are fixed and the ripple element (green dot in screenshot below) is positionned correctly inside the ripple container dom rect\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/components/assets/977713/7d746a62-1dc9-4e0f-a06e-e451db97b845)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  /** Fix coordinates emitted from the trigger element when is not the

This issue occurs despite the component being properly bound to the updated options. This behavior limits dynamic interaction capabilities, such as updating marker styles in real-time based on user interactions or data changes.\n\n### Use Case\n\nThis feature would allow developers to dynamically change the properties of markers on a map based on real-time data or user interactions. For example, changing the color or icon of a marker to reflect it's status (e.g., available, busy, or inactive) without needing to remove and re-add the marker to the map. This can be particularly useful in applications like live tracking systems, where the state of an object can change frequently.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29004","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(google-maps): Dynamic update support for advanced marker options\" (#29004)"},{"Id":"2278570918","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-04T16:55:19","Actor":"NickUfer","Number":"28999","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/dialog): support open and close animations for overlay and backdrop","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28999","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk/dialog): support open and close animations for overlay and backdrop\" (#28999)"},{"Id":"2278004955","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-03T16:31:10","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"28997","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/schematics): Change themeTypes to a single select instead of a multiselect prompt in M3 theme schematic","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28997","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/schematics): Change themeTypes to a single select instead of a multiselect prompt in M3 theme schematic\" (#28997)"},{"Id":"2277058079","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-03T13:04:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28996","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/button): incorrect template for icon button anchor","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the icon button anchor was using the base button template instead of the icon button one.\r\n\r\nFixes #28990.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28996","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/button): incorrect template for icon button anchor\" (#28996)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-05-09T03:30:02.0544692Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1395}

The reason for this is that the migration is not accounting for [NgFor's ngForTemplate input](https://angular.io/api/common/NgFor#ngForTemplate).\r\n\r\nbefore the migration:\r\n```\r\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let item of iterable; template: itemTemplate\"></ng-container>\r\n<ng-template #itemTemplate let-item>...</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter the automated migration:\r\n```\r\n@for (item of iterable; track item) {}\r\n<ng-template #itemTemplate let-item>...</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs there doesn't seem to be an equivalent available with the new @for-block for this use case,\r\none would have to use the following workaround to get it running:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@for (item of iterable; track item) {\r\n  <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"itemTemplate; context: {$implicit: item}\"></ng-container>\r\n}\r\n\r\n<ng-template #itemTemplate let-item>...</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough this is easy to do manually, I think the automated migration should either properly handle this case or at least notify the user to take manual action!

However unlike most packages in the npm registry, Angular does not actually include this license-copyright notice inside its NPM packages, only on the website. \r\n\r\nGiven most users of Angular probably have 100s of different NPMs in their application, a manual approach to licensing compliance is impractical - the only way anyone can hope to comply with the licensing terms for their NPM packages is to use automation to scan the NPM packages and generate a suitable attribution report with the copyright and notice messages (e.g. using tools such as scancode, BlackDuck, SonaType, mend.io etc). However unlike most NPM packages, Angular does not actually include the above attribution inside its packages, making it impossible to automate using the same tooling you'd use for most others. I guess you'd have to write some completely custom scripting just for Angular, or manually get a human to download the Angular license file and patch it into your auto-generated attribution notice. Not ideal. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe easy solution is include a NOTICES file containing the contents of https://angular.io/license inside all Angular's NPM packages, to allow compliance with the Angular notices to be automated. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n(unliekly): If we can't make it straightforward for users to comply with Angular's license terms through automation, remove the clause about requiring everyone to include the copyright+notice from the Angular license.

I see this as an issue in 2 places:\r\n\r\n* `angular.json` does not support conditional setting of values via environment variables. I can't even add comments in a valid JSON.\r\n* Because `ng test --codeCoverage` is a command-line option, I can't use it in `karma.conf.js`. This might be true to whatever replaced Karma recently (Jest by default?). Since I also use the Cypress component test runner, where I also enabled code coverage, an environment variable reused for both tools is more convenient.\r\n\r\nYes I understand that this makes migration scripts much harder to implement if not impossible. But look at how other frameworks work, e.g. Vite. You don't configure things in JSON, and it doesn't hide the option to enable code coverage behind a command-line flag or an `angular.json` property that I cannot control programmatically.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n* `angular.json` should be JavaScript or TypeScript, not JSON.\r\n* Let me use the option `ng test --codeCoverage` in `karma.conf.js` or whatever replaced Karma recently, so that I can enable code coverage conditionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26429","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow programmatic/conditional configurations\" (#26429)"},{"Id":"2000644191","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T15:07:21","Actor":"estrellajm","Number":"26413","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular CLI cannot exit `ng serve` or force quit.","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nserve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhile running ```ng serve``` when I try to cancel the process with  ```ctrl + c```, nothing happens.\r\n \r\nwith Node 20\r\n<img width=\"619\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-18 at 17 39 15\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/7454322/9e547e7f-35a7-4098-894d-44ef78f1725b\">\r\n\r\nwith Node 18 \r\n<img width=\"632\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-18 at 23 03 57\" src=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/7454322/d20f649e-77cd-4c24-9d7d-a52046dcef7f\">\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

This is correct if the bigint doesn't have a radix because bigint literals without a radix are always in canonical form (since leading zeros are not allowed). However, this is incorrect if the bigint has a radix (e.g. `0x123n`) because the canonical form is not enforced when a radix is present.\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    console.log(!!0n, !!1n, 123n === 123n)\n    console.log(!!0x0n, !!0x1n, 123n === 0x7Bn)\n\n    // Old output\n    console.log(false, true, true);\n    console.log(true, true, false);\n\n    // New output\n    console.log(false, true, true);\n    console.log(!!0x0n, !!0x1n, 123n === 0x7Bn);\n    ```\n\n-   Add some improvements to the JavaScript minifier\n\n    This release adds more cases to the JavaScript minifier, including support for inlining `String.fromCharCode` and `String.prototype.charCodeAt` when possible:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    document.onkeydown = e => e.keyCode === 'A'.charCodeAt(0) && console.log(String.fromCharCode(55358, 56768))\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    document.onkeydown=o=>o.keyCode===\"A\".charCodeAt(0)&&console.log(String.fromCharCode(55358,56768));\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    document.onkeydown=o=>o.keyCode===65&&console.log(\"🧀\");\n    ```\n\n    In addition, immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFEs) that return a single expression are now inlined when minifying. This makes it possible to use IIFEs in combination with `@__PURE__` annotations to annotate arbitrary expressions as side-effect free without the IIFE wrapper impacting code size. For example:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    const sideEffectFreeOffset = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ (() => computeSomething())()\n    use(sideEffectFreeOffset)\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    const e=(()=>computeSomething())();use(e);\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    const e=computeSomething();use(e);\n    ```\n\n-   Automatically prefix the `mask-composite` CSS property for WebKit ([#&#8203;3493](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3493))\n\n    The `mask-composite` property will now be prefixed as `-webkit-mask-composite` for older WebKit-based browsers. In addition to prefixing the property name, handling older browsers also requires rewriting the values since WebKit uses non-standard names for the mask composite modes:\n\n    ```css\n    /* Original code */\n    div {\n      mask-composite: add, subtract, intersect, exclude;\n    }\n\n    /* New output (with --target=chrome100) */\n    div {\n      -webkit-mask-composite:\n        source-over,\n        source-out,\n        source-in,\n        xor;\n      mask-composite:\n        add,\n        subtract,\n        intersect,\n        exclude;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Avoid referencing `this` from JSX elements in derived class constructors ([#&#8203;3454](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3454))\n\n    When you enable `--jsx=automatic` and `--jsx-dev`, the JSX transform is supposed to insert `this` as the last argument to the `jsxDEV` function. I'm not sure exactly why this is and I can't find any specification for it, but in any case this causes the generated code to crash when you use a JSX element in a derived class constructor before the call to `super()` as `this` is not allowed to be accessed at that point. For example\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class ChildComponent extends ParentComponent {\n      constructor() {\n        super(<div />)\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Problematic output (with --loader=jsx --jsx=automatic --jsx-dev)\n    import { jsxDEV } from \"react/jsx-dev-runtime\";\n    class ChildComponent extends ParentComponent {\n      constructor() {\n        super(/* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ jsxDEV(\"div\", {}, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: \"<stdin>\",\n          lineNumber: 3,\n          columnNumber: 15\n        }, this)); // The reference to \"this\" crashes here\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The TypeScript compiler doesn't handle this at all while the Babel compiler just omits `this` for the entire constructor (even after the call to `super()`). There seems to be no specification so I can't be sure that this change doesn't break anything important. But given that Babel is pretty loose with this and TypeScript doesn't handle this at all, I'm guessing this value isn't too important. React's blog post seems to indicate that this value was intended to be used for a React-specific migration warning at some point, so it could even be that this value is irrelevant now. Anyway the crash in this case should now be fixed.\n\n-   Allow package subpath imports to map to node built-ins ([#&#8203;3485](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3485))\n\n    You are now able to use a [subpath import](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) in your package to resolve to a node built-in module. For example, with a `package.json` file like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"type\": \"module\",\n      \"imports\": {\n        \"#stream\": {\n          \"node\": \"stream\",\n          \"default\": \"./stub.js\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can now import from node's `stream` module like this:\n\n    ```js\n    import * as stream from '#stream';\n    console.log(Object.keys(stream));\n    ```\n\n    This will import from node's `stream` module when the platform is `node` and from `./stub.js` otherwise.\n\n-   No longer throw an error when a `Symbol` is missing ([#&#8203;3453](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3453))\n\n    Certain JavaScript syntax features use special properties on the global `Symbol` object. For example, the asynchronous iteration syntax uses `Symbol.asyncIterator`. Previously esbuild's generated code for older browsers required this symbol to be polyfilled. However, starting with this release esbuild will use [`Symbol.for()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/for) to construct these symbols if they are missing instead of throwing an error about a missing polyfill. This means your code no longer needs to include a polyfill for missing symbols as long as your code also uses `Symbol.for()` for missing symbols.\n\n-   Parse upcoming changes to TypeScript syntax ([#&#8203;3490](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3490), [#&#8203;3491](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3491))\n\n    With this release, you can now use `from` as the name of a default type-only import in TypeScript code, as well as `of` as the name of an `await using` loop iteration variable:\n\n    ```ts\n    import type from from 'from'\n    for (await using of of of) ;\n    ```\n\n    This matches similar changes in the TypeScript compiler ([#&#8203;56376](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/56376) and [#&#8203;55555](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/55555)) which will start allowing this syntax in an upcoming version of TypeScript. Please never actually write code like this.\n\n    The type-only import syntax change was contributed by [@&#8203;magic-akari](https://togithub.com/magic-akari).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>eslint/eslint (eslint)</summary>\n\n### [`v8.54.0`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v8.54.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/compare/v8.53.0...v8.54.0)\n\n#### Features\n\n-   [`a7a883b`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a7a883bd6ba4f140b60cbbb2be5b53d750f6c8db) feat: for-direction rule add check for condition in reverse order ([#&#8203;17755](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17755)) (Angelo Annunziata)\n-   [`1452dc9`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/1452dc9f12c45c05d7c569f737221f0d988ecef1) feat: Add suggestions to no-console ([#&#8203;17680](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17680)) (Joel Mathew Koshy)\n-   [`21ebf8a`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/21ebf8a811be9f4b009cf70a10be5062d4fdc736) feat: update `no-array-constructor` rule ([#&#8203;17711](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17711)) (Francesco Trotta)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [`98926e6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/98926e6e7323e5dd12a9f016cb558144296665af) fix: Ensure that extra data is not accidentally stored in the cache file ([#&#8203;17760](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17760)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n-   [`e8cf9f6`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/e8cf9f6a524332293f8b2c90a2db4a532e47d919) fix: Make dark scroll bar in dark theme ([#&#8203;17753](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17753)) (Pavel)\n-   [`3cbeaad`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/3cbeaad7b943c153937ce34365cec2c406f2b98b) fix: Use `cwd` constructor option as config `basePath` in Linter ([#&#8203;17705](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17705)) (Milos Djermanovic)\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [`becfdd3`](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/commit/becfdd39b25d795e56c9a13eb3e77af6b9c86e8a) docs: Make clear when rules are removed ([#&#8203;17728](https://togithub.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17728)) (Nicholas C.

From v17 there is no possibility to reference static assets with absolute url. Using base hrefs is not proper replacement because relative links must stay relative to root when users wants to open links in new tab (ctrl + click) and also for non javascript consumers of server side rendered pages. Combinations with APP_BASE_HREF are not applicable for this use case. Due to this we believe this is regression for no good reason.\r\n\r\n              We are still planning to remove `deployUrl` eventually largely because of all the confusion it causes. The exact version it gets dropped is still TBH, but I can confidently say it will *not* be removed in v14, so this shouldn't be an immediate problem for anyone. The blog post in particular should hopefully help address common use cases which have used `deployUrl` in the past and how we recommend moving forward for each of them. We're not expecting any existing use cases to suddenly become unsupported, just that the right approach for you will probably vary by your particular requirements.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @dgp1130 in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22113#issuecomment-1099723870_\r\n            ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26411","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"No alternative to deploy url has been added as promised\" (#26411)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2003328890","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-21T02:24:33","Actor":"albahrawy","Number":"28160","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(angualr-builder cli): \"ng serve\" Not Reflecting Changes Automatically in Angular 17","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n16.x\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nfollowing on the [26414](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26414#event-11003637429) and [26334](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26334).

Even though the animation appears to happen, the callbacks do not get called.

The proposed Text Selection Service aims to simplify the process of monitoring text selections, making it easier for developers to build accessible applications.\r\n\r\nThe Text Selection Service could include methods for:\r\n- Retrieving the currently selected text.\r\n- Getting the range at a specified index.\r\n- Monitoring text selection within a specific HTML element.\r\n- Emitting events when the text selection starts or ends.\r\n- Ensuring accessibility by considering both mouse and keyboard interactions.\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Allow to develop CDK menus opening on text selection (like on Medium)\r\n- Allow to develop tooltips based on text selection (?)\r\n- Maybe more features I didn't think about","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28156","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(CDK): text selection service\" (#28156)"},{"Id":"2001256613","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T10:56:45","Actor":"nikos-moysiadis","Number":"28153","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(google-maps): convert to standalone","State":"closed","Body":"Converts google maps module to standalone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(google-maps): convert to standalone\" (#28153)"},{"Id":"2001277376","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T10:36:25","Actor":"nikos-moysiadis","Number":"28154","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(youtube-player): convert to standalone","State":"closed","Body":"Converts youtube player module to standalone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/28154","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(youtube-player): convert to standalone\" (#28154)"},{"Id":"2000413059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T10:35:29","Actor":"robertIsaac","Number":"28150","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(update): v17 migration process node_modules","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nthe original explanation is here https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/20301#issuecomment-1816592456\r\nbut short version, v17 migration while processing files to look for `@angular/material/legacy-`, it also include node_modules files\r\nthis causes two problems\r\n1. it's very slow for everyone\r\n2. it makes nx migration fails as mentioned in the link above\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. create new v16 of Angular `npx @angular/cli@16 new`\r\n2. add angular material `ng add @angular/material`\r\n3. update cli to v17 `ng update @angular/cli`\r\n4. update material to v17 `ng update @angular/material`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nit should take couple of seconds to updater material since it's a new project with few .ts files\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nit takes around 2 minutes with a very powerful PC\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 17.0.1\r\nNode: 18.16.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.7\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.1\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.1\r\n@angular/material               17.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.1\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28150","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(update): v17 migration process node_modules\" (#28150)"},{"Id":"2000746379","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-20T10:35:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28152","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): prevent ng update schematic from checking node_modules","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the `ng update` schematic was cheking `node_modules` and .d.ts files when looking for legacy imports.

HTML element. \r\nI'm working on a modal component using the dialog element and its \"showModal()\" API to display it as a modal dialog.\r\nThe problem is that the Overlay is not \"promoted\" to the top layer and it remains hidden behind the dialog.\r\nI'm attaching a [Stackblitz reproduction](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-kbnyrg?file=src%2Fdialog%2Fdialog.component.html) of the issue.\r\n\r\nIn addiction, I tried also to implement a custom overlay to place the `cdk-overlay-container` close to the input instead of the default behaviour at the bottom of the body, but then the `cdk-overlay-panel` _left_ position seems to be computed in a wrong way, in the sense that the content box seems to be the dialog but the left position is computed considering the viewport as content box. I guess (just guessing) the second issue is something related to [this discussion](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8040) about the w3c dialog specification.\r\n\r\nI found the issues using both @angular/cdk versions 16 and 17. The Stackblitz uses the latest one for convenience.\r\n\r\nThank you, looking forward for some feedback on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-kbnyrg?file=src%2Fdialog%2Fdialog.component.html\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.  Click the button \"Open dialog\"\r\n2.  Click on the input \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe overlay should appear below the input.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe overlay is hidden behind the dialog. If you change the backdrop color opacity you can see it behind.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 16 and 17\r\n- CDK/Material: 16.0.4 and 17\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Firefox\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows / Ubuntu \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/28133","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(cdk/overlay): Overlay not working with HTML dialog element\" (#28133)"},{"Id":"1996195306","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-16T07:01:20","Actor":"yatho","Number":"28132","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(schematcis): Failed ng add.

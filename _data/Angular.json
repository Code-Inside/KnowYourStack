Since ngtsc type checking can be more advanced, there are flags to enable more advanced checking of templates. \r\n\r\nThese flags cannot be set from within the `ng_module` Bazel rule unfortunately. The issue is that `ngc-wrapped` does not redirect the new strictness flags.

This works correctly under normal circumstances.\r\n\r\nHowever unit tests reset the input value when triggering a change detection (`fixture.detectChanges`). This does not occur if the attribute selector is removed, e.g. for `selector: 'my-component'`.\r\nThese errors are also reported by users in #18156. \r\n\r\nThis behaviour can be seen in the unit tests of the sample repo.\r\n\r\nThere is a second issue which is very likely related to this. Again if a component has a selector combined of element and attribute and it is used as a component in the router, any previously set value will be overriden. Note that using a component with inputs as a routable component might not be something angular is expected to do correctly.\r\n\r\nThis issue is also demonstrated in the sample repo and in [https://angular-issue-repro2-vtyahq.stackblitz.io/](this stackblitz).\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/marcuskrahl/attribute-selector-angular](repo)\r\n[https://angular-issue-repro2-vtyahq.stackblitz.io/](stackblitz)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nIt should not matter whether if a selector is defined including an attribute selector or not.

On the other side, if the path is composed by children routes and the main route doesn't have a component associated, then both all the matrix params will merge and doesn't respect its namespace.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nFor example.\r\n\r\nI define the following routes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    redirectTo: 'one',\r\n    pathMatch: 'full'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'One',\r\n    component: OneComponent\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'two/test',\r\n    component: TwoComponent\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\nThen, in OneComponent I have this function that I call in a button click event:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngoToTwo() {\r\n    this.router.navigate(['/two/', {twoMatrix: 'twoMatrixValue'}, 'test', {testMatrix: 'testMatrixValue'}]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn TwoComponent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n    this.activatedRoute.params.subscribe(values => {\r\n      console.log(values);\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen I click the button and I go to TwoComponent the URL becames into:\r\n\r\n`http://localhost:4200/two;twoMatrix=twoMatrixValue/test;testMatrix=testMatrixValue`\r\n\r\nBut when I print the activatedRoute params, only the matrix params related with the last path (test) are retrieved. It shows like this:\r\n\r\n`{testMatrix: \"testMatrixValue\"}`\r\n\r\nI expect that the params related with \"two\" will be also retrieved and printed.\r\n\r\nI was testing with another routes configuration, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    redirectTo: 'one',\r\n    pathMatch: 'full'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'one',\r\n    component: OneComponent\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'two',\r\n    children: [\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'test',\r\n        component: TwoComponent\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\nWith this children route, it works as expected. I am be able to retrieve all the parameters from this.activatedRoute.params.\r\n\r\nBut when I change this routes to this:\r\n```\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    redirectTo: 'one',\r\n    pathMatch: 'full'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'one',\r\n    component: OneComponent\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'two',\r\n    component: TwoComponent,\r\n    children: [\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'test',\r\n        component: TwoComponent\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\nThis way, TwoComponent prints its parameters in its corresponding path. This requires two `router-outlet`. Without component attribute in two path ActivatedRoute populates its paramsMap with both of `testMatrix` and `twoMatrix`. This behaviour has a downside, because if both of params have the same name, one will override the other. With this attribute the first TwoComponent will print `twoMatrix` and the second one `testMatrix`.\r\n\r\nThe other solution I've found to get all the params is by using the URL of the activatedRoute this.activatedRoute.snapshot.url[0].parameterMap\r\n\r\nThe final question is, why can't I retrieve the parameters with the first route configuration? I suspect that is because the route two/test acts as whole, but I am not sure. Is this a bug?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 8.0.1\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.6\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.6\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.6\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.6\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.6\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0<code>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Optional route matrix parameters not populated into paramMap of ActivatedRoute when route consists into two paths and each path have its own parameters\" (#33443)"},{"Id":"513272098","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T12:24:07","Actor":"xeinebiu","Number":"33442","RawContent":null,"Title":"BUILD ERROR 'Note' is not exported by node_modules/**","State":"open","Body":"Hi.\r\n\r\nFrom an angular project, when referencing to a model which is defiend on a Typescript module and as well it is exported as follows:\r\n> export * from './base/models';\r\n\r\nangular compiler complains when building, that the module is not exporting the model called \"Note\".\r\n\r\nThe following export works ok.\r\n> export { Note } from './base/models/note.model';\r\n\r\nBut, I am more interested on the first export mode using the wild card.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33442","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BUILD ERROR 'Note' is not exported by node_modules/**\" (#33442)"},{"Id":"513248572","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T11:30:36","Actor":"dxvladislavvolkov","Number":"33441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error in application build in prod mode","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/core@8.2.9\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n### Description\r\nDevextreme-angular prepared the package with angular package format and now the package is created using ng-packagr package (You can see the package structure [here](https://github.com/ovchinnikov/devextreme-angular-build)).

( :let | :as | :keyExp )*\"\r\n    keyExp = :key \":\"? :expression (\"as\" :local)? \";\"?\r\n    let = \"let\" :local \"=\" :export \";\"?\r\n    as = :export \"as\" :local \";\"?\r\n\r\nI describe several issues of the used notation and grammar rules. Each issue and my suggested solution is described in a section. The sections are separated by a horizontal line in the following. The presented solutions build on the (changes of the) previous solutions. The last section shows the final result (production rules).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Production rule `*:prefix` is not formatted consistently.\r\n**Solution:** Use one space character before and after `=`. Use one space character before `(` and no space character after `(`. Use no space character before `)`. Use one space character after `)` if it is not followed by an operator (`?` or `*`). Otherwise, only write one space character after the operator, but only if the operator is not followed by `)`.\r\n\r\n    *:prefix = \" (:let | :expression) (';' | ',')? (:let | :as | :keyExp)* \"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Prefix `:` of nonterminal symbols creates no added value.\r\n**Solution:** Remove `:`\r\n\r\n    *prefix = \" (let | expression) (';' | ',')? (let | as | keyExp)* \"\r\n    keyExp = key \":\"? expression (\"as\" local)? \";\"?\r\n    let = \"let\" local \"=\" export \";\"?\r\n    as = export \"as\" local \";\"?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** No consistent use of double quotation marks `\"` in the production rules. `\"` is used as terminal symbol in production rule `*prefix`, but as delimiter of string literals (sequence of terminal symbols) in the other production rules `keyExp`, `let` and `as`.\r\n**Solution:** Use `'` as delimiter and surround the double quotation terminal symbol with delimiters:\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let | expression) (';' | ',')? (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n    keyExp = key ':'? expression ('as' local)? ';'?\r\n    let = 'let' local '=' export ';'?\r\n    as = export 'as' local ';'?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Assignment of `export` to `local` variable is mandatory in production rule `let`, but the implementation allows to omit explicit assignment, like `let x` in\r\n\r\n    <p *ngFor=\"let x of ['a', 'b']\">{{x}}</p>\r\n\r\nwhich is treated like an implicit assignment of the special context property `$implicit` to `x`.\r\n\r\n**Solution:** Make assignment optional in production rule `let`:\r\n\r\n    let = 'let' local ('=' export)? ';'?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** The current grammar definition allows the production of two consecutive semicolons, see derivation example:\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let | expression) (';' | ',')? (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n            = '\"' (let             )  ';'         (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n            = '\"' ('let' local ('=' export)? ';'?) ';' (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n            = '\"'  'let' local  '=' export   ';'   ';' (let | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n\r\nBut the current implementation throws `Template parse errors` in that case, for example:\r\n\r\n    <p *ngFor=\"let i = index;; let x of ['a', 'b']\">{{i}}: {{x}}</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution:** Extract semicolon production from rule `let` into rule `*prefix` and move separator production `(';' | ',')?` to the alternative `expression`:\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let ';'? | expression (';' | ',')?) (let ';'? | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n    keyExp = key ':'? expression ('as' local)? ';'?\r\n    let = 'let' local ('=' export)?\r\n    as = export 'as' local ';'?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Production rules do not consider that (terminal symbol) colon may be used instead of semicolon separator. For example\r\n\r\n    <p *ngFor=\"let item of [1,2,3] as items; trackBy: myTrack, index as i\">{{i}}: {{item}}</p>\r\n\r\ncan not be produced using the current rules due to the colon after `myTrack`, but it is valid syntax in the implementation.\r\n\r\n**Solution:** Define production rule `sep` (abbreviation of *separator*):\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let sep? | expression sep?) (let sep? | as | keyExp)* '\"'\r\n    sep = ';' | ','\r\n    keyExp = key ':'? expression ('as' local)? sep?\r\n    let = 'let' local ('=' export)?\r\n    as = export 'as' local sep?\r\n\r\nThis can be simplified by moving `sep?` around in the definitions\r\n\r\n    *prefix = '\"' (let | expression) sep? ((let | as | keyExp) sep?)* '\"'\r\n    sep = ';' | ','\r\n    keyExp = key ':'? expression ('as' local)?\r\n    let = 'let' local ('=' export)?\r\n    as = export 'as' local\r\n\r\nThis code block represents my **final suggestion**.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33436","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs(docs-infra): fix (notation of) microsyntax grammar\" (#33436)"},{"Id":"513015240","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-27T20:10:30","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"33435","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(bazel): update bazel-schematics to use Ivy and new rollup_bundle","State":"open","Body":"Note: the @angular/bazel schematic now prepends the package.json \"script\" field with `ngcc; ` if there is an existing script field.

If I do I get weird double callbacks and click actions when clicking the notification outside the app (by having a new custom service worker that imports this one and firebase's).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nHave a boolean, like { ..., disablePush: true } in ngsw-config.json for hook listeners for push messages. I think these lines below could be activated based on the aforementioned boolean.\r\n\r\n@angular/packages/service-worker/worker/src/driver.ts  line: 158\r\n```\r\n    // Handle the fetch, message, and push events.\r\n    this.scope.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => this.onFetch(event !));\r\n    this.scope.addEventListener('message', (event) => this.onMessage(event !));\r\n    this.scope.addEventListener('push', (event) => this.onPush(event !));\r\n    this.scope.addEventListener('notificationclick', (event) => this.onClick(event !));\r\n```\r\nOr maybe there should be two service workers, one with and without these listeners. But I believe it would be a more complicated solution.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nRight now you have to make a new service worker then import ngsw and then overwrite the listeners so they do what you want. But still can't use firebase's messaging service worker nor its functionality (at least I couldn't).

Any command that builds the project obviously.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, the regression is obviously the removal of the `global` shim.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular` depends on a version of webpack, which depends on a version of node-libs-browser (deprecated!) which depends on a version of buffer that is actually using `global`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm ls buffer\r\niotgen-webui@0.1.0 /Users/ohcibi/Documents/Projekte/PERK/iotgen/iotgen-webui\r\n└─┬@angular-devkit/build-angular@0.803.14\r\n  └─┬ webpack@4.39.2\r\n    └─┬ node-libs-browser@2.2.1\r\n      └── buffer@4.9.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest versions of the `buffer` package have fixed that but since `node-libs-browser` is deprecated, this won't fix on webpack4. webpack 5 does not have the node-libs-browser dependency anymore.\r\n\r\nThe library I have installed and try to import was `jwt-simple`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n```\r\nnpm install -D jwt-simple\r\n# Add `import jwt from 'jwt-simple' to some angular module\r\nng serve\r\n# Visit route that uses the module with the import and see error in console\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nindex.js:43 Uncaught ReferenceError: global is not defined\r\n    at Object../node_modules/buffer/index.js (index.js:43)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:79)\r\n    at Object../node_modules/safe-buffer/index.js (index.js:2)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:79)\r\n    at Object../node_modules/randombytes/browser.js (browser.js:15)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:79)\r\n    at Object../node_modules/crypto-browserify/index.js (index.js:3)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:79)\r\n    at Object../node_modules/jwt-simple/lib/jwt.js (jwt.js:13)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:79)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.12\r\nNode: 12.12.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.1.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.14\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.14\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.14\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.12\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.12\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.14\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.12\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.12\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15954","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Outdated buffer sub dependency causes `global is not defined` error\" (#15954)"},{"Id":"513192248","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T09:34:45","Actor":"JGH153","Number":"15952","RawContent":null,"Title":"Each build of an Angular library is missing random files in the output folder","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nFirst time creating library myself, but I have never seen this bug in other libraries.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nEach run of my library (ng build hal-components) (my library) is missing random files in the dist/hal-components/lib folder. A few runs gives me all files, but most (ca 90%) is missing several files. The files missing changes on each run.\r\n\r\nRestarting the computer temporarily solves the problem, but it returns after a few hours to one days of use without a restart\r\n\r\nStill get the bug if I stop the ng serve command on the consuming project.

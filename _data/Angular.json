This gives only a bit of an insight on how does the service worker perform updates on the client side. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAs mentioned before the service worker currently exposes only two events\r\n - a new version is available to be activated\r\n - a new version has been activated\r\n\r\nIdeally the service would expose some additional events like\r\n - a new version has been detected to exist (but is not available to use yet)\r\n - a new version starts downloading\r\n - a new version finishes downloading\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to track those events, figure out why is it that some users are taking very long time to get the new version and/or maybe optimise some parts of the flow.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39840","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose more events from service worker update cycle\" (#39840)"},{"Id":"750686035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-25T10:19:04","Actor":"wojciechpolak","Number":"39838","RawContent":null,"Title":"\"Component inside a test host\" issue with ngc & Ivy","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by ngc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: non-Ivy\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nTesting a component inside a test host, according to:\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/testing-components-scenarios#component-inside-a-test-host\r\n\r\n`ngc` throws error (but only when Ivy is enabled).\r\n\r\nBut everything else works just fine (test, build, serve).\r\n\r\nDisable Ivy in `tsconfig.json`, re-run `ngc` and it will pass successfully.\r\n\r\nThis problem is also valid for previous Angular 10.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/wojciechpolak/ng11-test-host-problem\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre>$ npx ngc\r\nsrc/app/foobar/foobar.component.spec.ts:12:14 - error NG8001: 'app-foobar' is not a known element:\r\n1.

Upgraded to angular 11 almost together with getting the issue - might be.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI maintain a set of libraries to work with gRPC from Angular, here is the link: https://github.com/ngx-grpc/ngx-grpc\r\n\r\nThe lib includes 6 libs (located in `packages`):\r\n- one non-angular (however located between angular apps, just is not present in angular.json) - protoc plugin - `protoc-gen-ng`\r\n- 4 normal angular libs\r\n- 1 angular lib; built using Angular toolset but is used inside a web worker - `worker`.\r\n\r\nThere is also `examples` directory served as example and, well, as a test reference that all goes fine. This example uses all the libs, and this is the place where the error is happening.\r\n\r\nNow I added a module with forRoot / forChild in some of the angular libraries: core (2 modules), grpc-web-client (1 module) and worker-client (1 module). All modules and libs are working fine, all, but the latter one. It is just not processed by `ngcc`. When I start the application I see the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCompiling @ngx-grpc/common : es2015 as esm2015\r\n\r\nCompiling @ngx-grpc/core : es2015 as esm2015\r\n\r\nCompiling @ngx-grpc/- removing all references to the `Worker` type () : es2015 as esm2015\r\n\r\nCompiling @ngx-grpc/well-known-types : es2015 as esm2015\r\n\r\nCompiling @ngx-grpc/worker : es2015 as esm2015\r\n\r\nCompiling @ngx-grpc/worker-client : es2015 as esm2015\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the ngcc reaches the library, but the directory `__ivy_ngcc__` is not created in `dist/worker-client`, however for all other modules it is created. The outcome is that the latter library does not work.\r\n\r\nWhat I tried:\r\n- removing all references to the `Worker` type from `worker-client` - did not help\r\n- checking angular config, including angular.json, tsconfigs and ng-packagr  - did not help, it is totally equal to the working lib `grpc-web-client`\r\n- regenerated the lib from scratch - did not help\r\n- removed references to `worker` library from `worker-client` - did not help\r\n- moved code from `worker-client` to  `grpc-web-client` lib. This **made the code work**, meaning that the `grpc-web-client` had no problems with ngcc; and I can use the code in the example and it works just fine. However, I cannot get more out of it; I still need the code in a separate package. This also means that code is valid and it can be compiled by ngcc, but for some reason when it's in its own package it does not.\r\n\r\nWhat is also very weird - I would not be surprised if I had problems with `worker` library; it's built by Angular and used in Worker. And I have a feeling it can be connected to the issue. \r\n\r\nI don't know what / where else to dig. The issue is driving me crazy. It seems unlogical to me and I cannot find the reason. \r\n\r\nPlease help me out.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Clone https://github.com/ngx-grpc/ngx-grpc\r\n- Switch to develop branch\r\n- `npm ci`\r\n- `npm run build` - builds the libs\r\n- `npm run examples` - produces the error after ngcc compiler\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n    Error: dist/worker-client/lib/grpc-worker-client.module.d.ts:11:22 - error NG6002: Appears in the NgModule.imports of GrpcWorkerClientExampleModule, but could not be resolved to an NgModule class.\r\n    \r\n    This likely means that the dependency (@ngx-grpc/worker-client) which declares GrpcWorkerClientModule has not been processed correctly by ngcc.\r\n    \r\n    11 export declare class GrpcWorkerClientModule {\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 11.0.2\r\nNode: 14.5.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.0.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1100.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1100.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.0.2\r\n@angular/cdk                    11.0.0\r\n@angular/material               11.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular             11.0.2\r\n@schematics/update              0.1100.2\r\nng-packagr                      11.0.3\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure wheher the issue belongs to @angular/cli, please feel free to locate it properly in case it's necessary","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19484","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Library is skipped by Ivy / ngcc compiler\" (#19484)"},{"Id":"748093890","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-23T10:22:38","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"19458","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update postcss to version 8.1.9","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [postcss](https://postcss.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss)) | [`8.1.8` -> `8.1.9`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/postcss/8.1.8/8.1.9) | ![age](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/postcss/8.1.9/age-slim) | [![adoption](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/postcss/8.1.9/adoption-slim)](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/news-whitesource/merge-confidence-feature) | [![passing](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/postcss/8.1.9/compatibility-slim/8.1.8)](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/news-whitesource/merge-confidence-feature) | [![confidence](https://badges.renovateapi.com/packages/npm/postcss/8.1.9/confidence-slim/8.1.8)](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/news-whitesource/merge-confidence-feature) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/postcss</summary>\n\n### [`v8.1.9`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;819)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/8.1.8...8.1.9)\n\n-   Reduced dependencies number (by Bogdan Chadkin).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Each `treeitem` element is supposed to either contain or `aria-own` a `role=\"group\"` element that contains all of its child nodes. To keep the notion of the flat-tree alive, we've have to use `aria-owns` in a way that looks something like this:\r\n```html\r\n<div role=\"tree\">\r\n  <div role=\"treeitem\" aria-owns=\"greek-children\">Greek</div>\r\n  <div role=\"group\" id=\"greek-children\">\r\n    <div role=\"treeitem\">Alpha</div>\r\n    <div role=\"treeitem\">Beta</div>\r\n    <div role=\"treeitem\">Gamma</div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich means that it would be the responsibility of the tree to figure out where to insert these `role=\"group\"` elements, which I'm not totally sure is possible. \r\n\r\nThe nested tree is easier to reconcile, since we actually do nest the nodes; the main problem is that we're missing the `role=\"group\"` element for nodes that have children. The desired structure would look something like\r\n```html\r\n<div role=\"tree\">\r\n  <div role=\"treeitem\">\r\n    Greek\r\n    <div role=\"group\">\r\n      <div role=\"treeitem\">Alpha</div>\r\n      <div role=\"treeitem\">Beta</div>\r\n      <div role=\"treeitem\">Gamma</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/21143","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tree does not follow the expected ARIA structure\" (#21143)"},{"Id":"750109998","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-24T22:21:51","Actor":"vyrotek","Number":"21141","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatBottomSheet): Async state changes not detected and rendered","State":"open","Body":"Please reevaluate and reopen this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/issues/11627 \r\n\r\nConfirmed to still be an issue with Ang/Material 11.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the component state within a sheet is updated from an async subscription (ex.

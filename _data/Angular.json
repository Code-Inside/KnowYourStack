Using `ChangeDetectorRef ` `markForCheck()` or `detectChanges()` won't help here.\r\n\r\nThis is only one simple example. We see this issue in other situations too. For example, when we insert a number 1.11. When number than is modified to 1.111 and been rounded in the Java backend to precision 2 and the same value is returned (1.11) than we have the same issue. (input shows 1.111, model value is 1.11)\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-fwanqj?file=README.md\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nHTML shows different value than bound by typescript file.\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nsee prepared stackblitz example.\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48629","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Async value between view and model \" (#48629)"},{"Id":"1516416015","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-05T22:52:09","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"48624","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): cleanup type any in forms tests","State":"closed","Body":"Removing every type any in forms with a reference to #9100\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48624","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(forms): cleanup type any in forms tests\" (#48624)"},{"Id":"1521475232","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-05T21:45:48","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"48651","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(platform-browser): prepare the code to use `MockPlatformLocation` by default","State":"open","Body":"This commit prepares the code of the `BrowserTestingModule` to include the `MockPlatformLocation` by deafult in the future.

This PR is the beginning of our approach to make debugging dependency injection in Angular easier.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis commit introduces injector profiler callbacks in parts of the framework to emit injector events. It also introduces a default handler for these events. This default handler parses the stream of events to construct some data structures that will support new injector debug APIs. This commit introduces one of these new APIs `getInjectedServices`, which will be used by DevTools to implement some DI inspecting features. See comments in `injector-profiler.ts` for more implementation details.\r\n\r\n## Why was this implemented with a profiler?\r\n- DI maps nicely to a stream of events.\r\n- There is the possibility of making the internal `setInjectorProfiler` function a public debug API in the future, so that users can implement their own handlers to debug DI events.\r\n\r\n## Will this affect runtime performance?\r\nFor production builds no.

Some of the prominent issues I have faced with the website include:\r\n\r\n* The Tour of Heroes tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of Observables.\r\n\r\n* Instead of briefly defining some concepts before using them, the tutorial just provides hyperlinks. These concepts include the **property-binding syntax** and **Input decorator**. A reader who's learning Angular should be told what these do in addition to placing links in case the reader wants to study them extensively.\r\n\r\n* I often find myself googling some concepts which are poorly explained in the docs. For example, the documentation on `**Content Child**` says that \"Content Child is used for getting the first element or the directive matching the selector from the content DOM\". **What is the content DOM?** It doesn't say. To make things worse, it doesn't even say what  **Content Child** does in simple terms which is to **grab elements between the opening tags of a host element**. Similarly, View DOM is mentioned in the **View Child** documentation w/o stating what View DOM is.\r\n\r\n* [SUGGESTION]: There should be a tutorial on building a CRUD app like a todo app in the docs too. This would be a nice way to introduce the strengths of Angular. Plus, this is how other frameworks like React present themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Angular docs should be thoroughly revised unless it is assumed that most readers come from professional backgrounds which I doubt is the case.\r\nAngular is an interesting framework and it would be a shame if people shy away from it because the docs look scary.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48626","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Are there any plans to improve the Angular docs?

(potentially by making assumptions on what the developer wanted to accomplish). This can result in a slightly better/more convenient DX but a less clean/clear API, it could be rather convenient for example in `useAnimation`s. (It could require quite a bit of refactoring) I also think that this would make the `state`s work in a way they are not supposed to, so I personally wouldn't go with it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48625","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Animations - Adding a Dev warning for wrongly applied `state`s\" (#48625)"},{"Id":"1516322815","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-02T12:03:15","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"48622","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Improve typings for EventEmitter.subscribe()","State":"open","Body":"When passed an observer object, the next callback had any as argument, this commit improves this behavior.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this kind of change could be passed in a minor release. \r\n\r\nFixes: #29016\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes (Kinda ?)

It has the advantage of adhering to the newly developed style guide when CLI builds new components and other components. Maybe the style guide truly needs to hear this comment. That much duplication and naming is unquestionably produced. We receive N copies of each item's name across various folders and files when we add something using this tools, and we also receive N copies of each item's name in two separate ways. This causes a lot of friction when it's time to rename, which happens frequently in actual applications. There doesn't seem to be anything that can be done about it as it has already been decided that each name will be used twice as an official style (or more).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nIn VSCode, for instance, you can see error messages in the files explorer pane on the left when something is wrong (imported file that isn't there, non-existent component, etc.).

Prior to this, the release builds were performed using a custom build script that programmatically invoked TypeScript APIs. The Bazel build and discovery process for the releasable packages is performed by a script that is based on the scripts from components and framework repositories. Several small modifications were performed to match the behavior and structure of the cli repository:\r\n* Use of `packages` as the source root in the bazel query\r\n* Use of `pkg_npm` rule in the bazel query\r\n* Partial transition to native Node.js `fs` APIs instead of `shelljs`\r\n* Directory creation per package when copying output (supports multiple package scopes)\r\n* Copying of archives (tgz) for each package\r\n\r\nThe snapshot and local build capabilities are not modified as part of this change but will be merged in a followup as part of a larger transition to use bazel throughout the package build process.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/24483","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: use bazel to perform release builds\" (#24483)"},{"Id":"1518375548","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-04T16:06:12","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24485","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency typescript to v4.9.4","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`4.9.3` -> `4.9.4`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/4.9.3/4.9.4) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>Microsoft/TypeScript</summary>\n\n### [`v4.9.4`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/TypeScript/releases/tag/v4.9.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/compare/v4.9.3...v4.9.4)\n\nFor release notes, check out the [release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9).\n\nFor the complete list of fixed issues, check out the\n\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript v4.9.4](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\\&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+4.9.4%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n\nDownloads are available on:\n\n-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)\n-   [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild)\n\n##### Changes:\n\n-   [`e286821`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/e2868216f637e875a74c675845625eb15dcfe9a2) Bump version to 4.9.4 and LKG.\n-   [`eb5419f`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/eb5419fc8d980859b98553586dfb5f40d811a745) Cherry-pick [#&#8203;51704](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51704) to release 4.9 ([#&#8203;51712](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51712))\n-   [`b4d382b`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/b4d382b9b12460adf2da4cc0d1429cf19f8dc8be) Cherry-pick changes for narrowing to tagged literal types.\n-   [`e7a02f4`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/e7a02f43fce47e1a39259ada5460bcc33c8e98b5) Port of [#&#8203;51626](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51626) and [#&#8203;51689](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51689) to release-4.9 ([#&#8203;51627](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51627))\n-   [`1727912`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/1727912f0437a7f367d90040fc4b0b4f3efd017a) Cherry-pick fix around `visitEachChild` to release-4.9.

To distinguish them while running, we use `*.spec.ts` for jest tests, and `*.karma-spec.ts` for karma tests. This was fine up until we upgraded to angular 15 - now there's no longer an obvious way to only load and run files with the `*.karma-spec.ts` suffix.\r\n\r\nPreviously we used code like the following in our `test.ts` file: \r\n```ts\r\ndeclare const require: {\r\n  context(path: string, deep?: boolean, filter?: RegExp): {\r\n    keys(): string[];\r\n    <T>(id: string): T;\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\n...\r\n// Find all the tests.\r\nconst context = require.context('../../', true, /\\.karma-spec\\.ts$/);\r\n// And load the modules.\r\ncontext.keys().map(context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code was removed by the migration, but I don't see a documented config option for the suffix.

Then update to ng 15*, and try running the tests:\r\n\r\n```sh \r\nyarn ng update @angular/core@15 @angular/cli@15\r\nyarn test # Still works\r\nyarn karma:headless # Fails with error below\r\n\r\n...\r\n./libs/ui-lib/src/lib/ui-lib.component.spec.ts - Error: Module build failed (from ./node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/index.js):\r\nError: ng-jest-starter\\libs\\ui-lib\\src\\lib\\ui-lib.component.spec.ts is missing from the TypeScript compilation.

To do this, we modified the following file: `@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js` and applied the following patch:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js b/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\nindex 3f469dc..eafca93 100644\r\n--- a/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\n+++ b/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/webpack/configs/common.js\r\n@@ -245,10 +245,14 @@ async function getCommonConfig(wco) {\r\n             publicPath: (_b = buildOptions.deployUrl) !== null && _b !== void 0 ? _b : '',\r\n             filename: `[name]${hashFormat.chunk}.js`,\r\n             chunkFilename: `[name]${hashFormat.chunk}.js`,\r\n-            libraryTarget: isPlatformServer ?

Additionally, we turned off the `bundleDependencies` for the server build.\r\n\r\nThe command looks like this:\r\n```sh\r\nENV=$ENV \\\r\nIS_DEV_APP=true \\\r\nLOCALHOST_APP=$PROJECT \\\r\nIGNORE_MISSING_APPS=true\\\r\nNG_PERSISTENT_BUILD_CACHE=1 \\\r\nNODE_OPTIONS=\"--experimental-specifier-resolution=node --max_old_space_size=25600 --loader ./scripts/esm-interop/esm-main-loader.mjs\" \\\r\nTS_NODE_PROJECT=\"./src/tsconfig.$PROJECT.server.json\" \\\r\n./node_modules/.bin/ng run $PROJECT:serve-ssr${CONFIGURATION} $BUILD_ARGS\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What we have encountered with\r\nHowever, upon attempting to build the application, we encountered an issue where Node.js is unable to import the correct bundle from the package.json file. It appears that Node.js is trying to use the \"main\" field in the package.json file, which refers to the legacy resolver, instead of the bundle that was built using the Angular Compatibility Compiler. The following error is thrown at runtime:\r\n```\r\nnode:internal/errors:464\r\n    ErrorCaptureStackTrace(err);\r\n    ^\r\n\r\nError [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2015/core.mjs not supported.\r\nInstead change the require of /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@angular/core/fesm2015/core.mjs to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.\r\n    at /Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@agm/core/bundles/agm-core.umd.js:2:76\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/gmagyar/freelancer-dev/fl-gaf/webapp/node_modules/@agm/core/bundles/agm-core.umd.js:5:2)\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 0) {\r\n  code: 'ERR_REQUIRE_ESM'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What else we have tried\r\nAs a potential solution, we tried to use the `@angular/tools/esm-interop/*` module loader that was pushed a few days ago. However, this caused other issues during the build. When we were trying to troubleshoot this issue, we saw that the `globby` variable was undefined in the `./node_modules/copy-webpack-plugin/dist/index.js`. We also noticed that at the end of the compilation, `this.debug(...)` is undefined in the `./node_modules/minimatch/minimatch.js` file. There is a problem with the sub `node_modules/` resolution. Basically, the current implementation of `esm-interop` module won't look into the `./node_modules/copy-webpack-plugin/node_modules/` folder in this case.\r\n\r\n```\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 14.1.3\r\nNode: 16.14.0\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1401.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.3.9\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.5\r\n@angular/fire                   7.3.0\r\n@angular/material               14.2.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders           14.0.3\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     14.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             14.1.3\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24461","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support running ESM for SSR\" (#24461)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1521295597","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-05T19:42:47","Actor":"zarend","Number":"26375","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(material/chips): update a11y documention on checkmark indicators","State":"open","Body":"Update the accessibility section on checkmark indicators for single-selection.

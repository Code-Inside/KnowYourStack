There we do some checks like checking that only latin characters are allowed (company guideline...).\nWe also do have some more use cases of these validator within a custom component.\n\nOn X i was answered that with signal forms validators are defined when the form is created and can't be added afterwards.\n\nThis reads to me that the usage of validators in custom controls using `NG_VALIDATORS` is no longer supported. Is this the case and when yes, why is this? For our use case it would be awesome to still be able to use them, even with signal forms.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSupport `NG_VALIDATORS` in a similar way as before.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI don't see alternatives to these inner custom component valdiators","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/64493","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Plans to support NG_VALIDATORS in signal forms\" (#64493)"},{"Id":"3523900616","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-17T14:53:04","Actor":"leonsenft","Number":"64485","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(forms): field directive marks field as touched on 'blur' events","State":"closed","Body":"This was implemented but missing a test case.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/64485","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(forms): field directive marks field as touched on 'blur' events\" (#64485)"},{"Id":"3524453262","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-17T14:52:27","Actor":"SkyZeroZx","Number":"64487","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): Corrects repo name typo in entry parsing logic","State":"closed","Body":"Ensures the repository reference uses the correct name to prevent confusion and maintain consistency across generated documentation entries.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I noticed it affects the `new` and `add` commands, but I assume it affects every command.\n\nAfter a fresh installation, running `ng <whatever>` will prompt the user whether they are OK with setting up telemetry. My expectation is that commands like `ng add @angular/material --defaults` (or using `--skip-confirmation`) which contain flags that disable interactive prompts should also skip this telemetry interactive prompt.\n\nOtherwise, this causes automated tools and LLMs to halt if the tools do not support interactive prompts.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g @angukar/cli\nnpm install -g @google/gemini\n# <now install Angular MCP server in `.gemini/settings.json`>\n\ngemini\n```\nWait for Gemini to come up and prompt:\n```\nCreate an empty new Angular application using Angular best practices. Avoid interactive prompts.\n```\n\nHere, gemini got stuck because even though it was using `--defaults` and `--skip-confirmation` to avoid interactive prompts, the Angular CLI was still interactively asking whether the user wants to set up telemetry.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.10...v0.25.11)\n\n- Add support for `with { type: 'bytes' }` imports ([#&#8203;4292](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4292))\n\n  The [import bytes](https://redirect.github.com/tc39/proposal-import-bytes) proposal has reached stage 2.7 in the TC39 process, which means that although it isn't quite recommended for implementation, it's generally approved and ready for validation. Furthermore it has already been implemented by [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/examples/importing_bytes/) and [Webpack](https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/19928). So with this release, esbuild will also add support for this. It behaves exactly the same as esbuild's existing [`binary` loader](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#binary). Here's an example:\n\n  ```js\n  import data from './image.png' with { type: 'bytes' }\n  const view = new DataView(data.buffer, 0, 24)\n  const width = view.getInt32(16)\n  const height = view.getInt32(20)\n  console.log('size:', width + '\\xD7' + height)\n  ```\n\n- Lower CSS media query range syntax ([#&#8203;3748](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3748), [#&#8203;4293](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4293))\n\n  With this release, esbuild will now transform CSS media query range syntax into equivalent syntax using `min-`/`max-` prefixes for older browsers. For example, the following CSS:\n\n  ```css\n  @&#8203;media (640px <= width <= 960px) {\n    main {\n      display: flex;\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  will be transformed like this with a target such as `--target=chrome100` (or more specifically with `--supported:media-range=false` if desired):\n\n  ```css\n  @&#8203;media (min-width: 640px) and (max-width: 960px) {\n    main {\n      display: flex;\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It now uses `fs.stat` to retrieve the inode of each directory and tracks visited inodes in a Set. If a directory with a previously seen inode is encountered, it is skipped, effectively breaking the infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a minor performance overhead due to the extra `stat` call per

Unfortunately, the required values are not exposed via `--mat-sys` CSS variables, so the workaround ends up using internal CSS classes selectors. In some cases, it might require using `!import` if styles are not wrapper in some parent CSS class - which is considered an anti-pattern.\n\nHere is a version with bottom sheet styles overwrites to match Material 3 specification:\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/3dhv1nhh?file=src%2Fstyles.css\n\nPlease let me know if you need any help with this in case the bug or story gets picked up — happy to support!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link (from official material.angular.io page): https://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fexample%2Fbottom-sheet-overview-example.ts&startScript=start \nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

I am not devaluing `Validators`. I am just saying when we finally have to install [3rd party packages](https://openbase.com/categories/js/best-angular-validation-libraries) due to lake of `Validators` functionality why even it should exists?\r\n\r\nI am just asking question. If you ask me I would say I prefer to use Angular built-in functionalities if it gave me what I need. BTW this is my opinion and please tell me if I am wrong.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd more built-in validators. here is a simple list which I would say pretty much every developer in his app needs:\r\n\r\n- isBoolean\r\n- isAlphanumberic\r\n- isAlpha\r\n- isUppercase\r\n- isLowercase\r\n- validateIf // as its name implies it will validate if a given condition be true. Mostly that condition emerges from the form\r\n- isNumber\r\n- isInt32\r\n- isInt64\r\n- isFloat\r\n- isDouble\r\n- isString\r\n- isDateString\r\n- isDate\r\n\r\nI know some of them seems unreasonable but this is my opinion.\r\n\r\nI am inspired by class-validator.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThere is no problem with publishing uncomplete API where there are plans to make it better - Kaizen.\r\nBut if there is no plan to make it better and other libraries did/do not build their libraries on top of it, IMHO it is better to turn it off.\r\n\r\nNote: Even though I said and say this is a #completely_personal_opinion.

Each WebComponent uses `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom` and includes a SCSS file that provides some \"global\" (= inside Shadow DOM) classes that can be used by all child components (which use default encapsulation).\r\n\r\n**Problem**:  \r\nMultiple Angular Components include the same SCSS file via styleUrls. After building the app, the main bundle now includes these CSS styles once per component, the styles are duplicated - which results in a large bundle (and thus requires to increase the budget limit).\r\n\r\nWe use Angular 13/14 but the problem can be reproduced in a newly created Angular 11 app. After disabling Ivy (which is not possible in newer Angular versions) the styles are not duplicated anymore but only included once in the bundle and referenced by all components. And that's the behavior I would expect.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this change was intended or not but I couldn't find any information about that in the update guide / changelog / PRs.\r\n\r\nFor components with `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated` styles cannot be (easily) shared because the selectors are made unique but it's possible for Shadow DOM (and `ViewEncapsulation.None` I guess).\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rothsandro/repro-angular-duplicated-component-styles\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n**Angular 11, Ivy disabled**  \r\nThe styles are centralized and reused across all components:\r\n\r\n![ivy-disabled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16229645/174296323-3eaf6b45-086b-4255-bc6b-2adef0b1c5f1.png)\r\n\r\n**Angular 11+, Ivy enabled**:  \r\nThe styled are directly part of the component and duplicated:\r\n\r\n![ivy-enabled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16229645/174296342-245d962f-12f8-4dcb-9318-d490696f01e3.png)\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 11.2.19\r\nNode: 14.18.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 11.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: No\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1102.19\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1102.19\r\n@angular-devkit/core            11.2.19\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      11.2.19\r\n@angular/cli                    11.2.19\r\n@schematics/angular             11.2.19\r\n@schematics/update              0.1102.19\r\nrxjs                            6.6.7\r\ntypescript                      4.1.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46418","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Component Styles are not shared anymore but duplicated per component with Ivy\" (#46418)"},{"Id":"1274835665","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T15:02:11","Actor":"sofeepokhrel","Number":"46413","RawContent":null,"Title":"angular-language-service for emacs","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nlanguage-service\n\n### Description\n\nI see there no guide for setting up language service for emacs , while i see a lot of text editor mentioned there not emacs (https://angular.io/guide/language-service)\r\nWe want angular language service for emacs also . \r\nThank you.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThere are many implementations of language server  into emacs , such as most popular is \r\n \r\n1) `lsp-mode` (https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode)\r\n\r\nwhere this angular language server can be used.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThere are alternative such as `eglot` which is lightweight lsp mode more attached with emacs .\r\nhttps://github.com/joaotavora/eglot\r\n\r\nThere is discussion (2018) on adding `angular-language-service` in eglot \r\nhttps://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/172  but never solved.

When the router creates a component within the lazy-loaded context, Angular prefers service instances created from these **providers** to the service instances of the application root injector....\":\r\n    2.1) First, the bold part, **add**, what dose it mean? because it dose not just \"add\" from root to child injector, child inherits parent, them and if you **don't** provide same token in lazymodule, then it can access **same** instance in root injector, I found a discussion about this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52638901/is-lazy-loading-creating-new-injector-in-angular)\r\n    2.2)  The second **providers**,  what \"providers\" is refered here? I think maybe you intended to the child injector that inherits the parent one, and if child injector also provide same token, then , lazy context get a copy instnace, else get the root one, right?\r\n\r\n### What is the affected URL?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

Then I only modify the app.component.ts file.

On pressing add the angular application is being loaded inside an iframe and on pressing remove button the application is being destroyed and iframe is removed from DOM. \r\n\r\nThe content of index.html file which is being served by IIS is written below:\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n    <title>Document</title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body style=\"width: 100vw; height: 100vh;\">\r\n    <div id=\"a\"></div>\r\n    <button onclick=\"add()\">Add</button>\r\n    <button onclick=\"remove()\">Remove</button>\r\n</body>\r\n<script>\r\n    function add() {\r\n        let body = document.getElementById('a');\r\n        let rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);\r\n        // body.innerHTML = `<iframe src=\"http://localhost/app5/#/?_dc=${rand}\" title=\"Miscellaneous Entry Form\" id=\"miscEntFrm\" style=\"width:100%; height:99%; border:none;\"></iframe>`;\r\n        // body.innerHTML = `<iframe src=\"http://localhost/app1/#/misc?userId=125334675\" title=\"Miscellaneous Entry Form\" id=\"miscEntFrm\" style=\"width:100%; height:99%; border:none;\"></iframe>`;\r\n        body.innerHTML = `<iframe src=\"http://localhost:4200\" title=\"Memory Leak Demo\" id=\"miscEntFrm\" style=\"width:100%; height:99%; border:none;\"></iframe>`;\r\n    }\r\n    function remove() {\r\n        document.getElementById('miscEntFrm').contentWindow.postMessage(\"close\", \"*\");\r\n\r\n        setTimeout(() => {\r\n            let frame = document.getElementById('miscEntFrm');\r\n            //frame.contentWindow.location.reload();\r\n            frame.src = 'about:blank';\r\n            frame.remove();\r\n            frame = undefined;\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nBut the thing is, when observing memory tab performance monitor I notice that heap memory is constantly increasing when adding and removing the angular application along with iframe.

Arguments like `noBuild`, `noSilent`, `noDotFiles` no longer work, but `buildTarget` and `dryRun` do. I assume this is related with https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/22778 and the fact that Yargs supports `--no-flags`. In the past, the word `no` had no meaning, now it has one: https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/main/docs/tricks.md#negate\r\n\r\nIn Angular 13 i was able write `no-build` as an argument and it was used as it-is, but now this is interpreted as the negation of `build` – which is an unknown argument. This breaks a couple of builders that all share some code/ideas and use the same argument called `no-build`.\r\n\r\n* [@netlify-builder/deploy](https://github.com/ngx-builders/netlify-builder/blob/b915395041d61d460f3a312c1a9c7cc9a683cda2/src/deploy/schema.json#L17)\r\n* [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages#no-build)\r\n* as well as [ngx-deploy-docker](https://github.com/kauppfbi/ngx-deploy-docker), [ngx-deploy-npm](https://github.com/bikecoders/ngx-deploy-npm), and [ngx-deploy-ftp](https://github.com/bohoffi/ngx-deploy-ftp)\r\n* there could be more...\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nPlease follow our [README for contributors](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages/blob/master/docs/README_contributors.md), which is essentially:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the project\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   git clone https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages.git\r\n   cd angular-cli-ghpages\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Install the dependencies\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd src\r\n   npm install\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Build the project:\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npm run build\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Create a local npm link:\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd dist\r\n   npm link\r\n   ```\r\n \r\n 5. Go to a new folder and create a fresh angular project:\r\n \r\n    ```sh\r\n    ng new test\r\n    cd test\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n6. Add the local version of `angular-cli-ghpages`.\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npm link angular-cli-ghpages\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n7.

In Angular 13, when I click a dropdown for the Angular Material MatMenu, it will sometimes position the dropdown options underneath the bottom of the page. I can get it to do it reliably by clicking \"Refresh\" in my browser over and over (it happens roughly 50% of the time so I can usually get the behavior to come out with the 4th refresh or so).\r\n\r\n2. When I inspect the css in DevTools, I see that `cdk-overlay-container` does not have the styles like `position: fixed;` that place it in the right location. In other words, the material styles do not seem to have loaded.\r\n\r\n3. This bug does **not** occur in development, only when building (`ng build`) or serving in production (`ng serve --configuration production`). Moreover, if I set `optimization: false` within `angular.json` for `production`, the bug also disappears. This is why I am posting this issue within the angular-cli repo as I am guessing that the issue stems from the minification process or something else in the optimization process.\r\n\r\n4. In looking around, a lot of other people who have experienced the same Angular Material issue experience it when they do not load the prebuilt themes (e.g. https://github.com/angular/components/issues/1387), but I do have the prebuilt themes loaded correctly (which is why for me it works around 50% of the time, but doesn't work 50% of the time). I was able to find one other case in which others experienced \"random\" occurrences of missing styles like what I'm experiencing. In that issue (links below), it was found that \"Chrome loads styles for Material later then application starts rendering in Angular\". So my **guess** is that the bug I'm experiencing is also related to the timing of when styles are being loaded.\r\n\r\n* https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/t915721/devextreme-material-theme-doesn-t-load-properly-in-production-build\r\n* https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/t917577/devextreme-does-not-attach-additional-classes-to-dx-viewport-in-chrome-84-on-the-first\r\n\r\nAny chance all of those clues mean something to someone?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI haven't quite been able to create a simple reproduction in Stackblitz, but I got pretty close with this Stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-afy6ka?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.html,src%2Fapp%2Fexample-component.css,src%2Fstyles.scss,angular.json. When I first created that stackblitz and started working towards a reproduction, I recreated the problem by just removing the `aot: true` from `angular.json` and adding a simple example of a mat-menu within a page with `height: 100%;` for `html`, `body`, and all containers. However, once I used the \"Share\" link from the Stackblitz, the problem wasn't there anymore. I created a screen recording to show that I really did create the effect in this Stackblitz, but it somehow disappeared when I Shared it and also after I refreshing the browser\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863081/174004841-7edb886f-f8dc-4085-8bc5-3dea3fc883c2.mov\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that the combination of all these clues will give someone an idea of what the issue is.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new

What is the reason to implement it like this? What problems does you implementation solve or prevent? From what I can see, it's just limiting a very common use-case, without any reasonable benefits. If you really insist on this, at least make it optional with an input binding, so we can opt-out of it when we don't need it. \r\n\r\nThe only workaround for this is to use some other value, e.g. '' and then map it back and forth all over the place, for each mat-select. Honestly this is ridiculous. Totally messy, bug prone etc. and still a very poor workaround. \r\n\r\nI haven't found a single workaround that would enable the desired behaviour in the use-case when you have your own component, implementing control value accessor, which wraps a mat-select. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/i919jzNOoXhlPeN4hxxE?p=preview\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSelect should display text associated with null/undefined value when provided\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSelect displays nothing\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14,0,0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): ALL\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): ALL\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25120","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-select does not display default (null) option text in mat-option\" (#25120)"},{"Id":"1277167533","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-20T16:37:08","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"25119","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular shared dev-infra code to f2ca0a5","State":"open","Body":"[![Mend Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/dev-infra-private](https://togithub.com/angular/dev-infra-private-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `e45a0b6` -> `f2ca0a5` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `91c9200` -> `04a54cd` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

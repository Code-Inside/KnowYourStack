We are serving our assets from a CDN, and so far we were building separate applications with `--locale=..` which was working fine, because we knew the locale and we could just specify `--deployUrl=https://cdn.com/assets/${locale}`.\r\nHowever now moving to `--localize` flag I can't do that anymore, because there's a single build for all locales.\r\n\r\n#### Actual problem\r\nSince `locale` is actually added to the `--baseHref=/assets/` forming\r\n```html\r\n<href base=\"/assets/${locale}\">\r\n```  \r\nthen I would almost expect the same thing to happen with `--deployUrl` because I don't know that suffix a priori. \r\n\r\n#### Alternative solution\r\nAnother solution is constructing that path like\r\n```\r\ndeployUrl + baseHref + locale + asset/path\r\n```\r\nAnd in that case running \r\n```sh\r\n$ ng build --baseHref=/assets/ --deployUrl=https://cdn.com/ --localize\r\n```\r\nwould return the proper localized asset path with the cdn\r\n\r\n#### What I'm running\r\nSo currently my `ng build` looks like\r\n```sh\r\n$ ng build --baseHref=/assets/ --deployUrl=https://cdn.com/assets/ --localize\r\n```\r\nand while `baseHref` works fine, the `deployUrl` points at (for example) https://cdn.com/assets/main.js instead of https://cdn.com/assets/${locale}/main.js which ends up as HTTP 404.\r\nFor the record in `app.module.ts` I have\r\n```ts\r\n{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: '/' }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Similar issues\r\nI was reading some other issues and probably the closest one was https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16625\r\nbut we can't grep/replace the assets because of our PWA configuration and hash checking the assets.\r\nSo is my approach wrong here? or is it actually a bug?\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n`$ ng build --baseHref=/assets/ --deployUrl=https://cdn.com/assets/ --localize`\r\n\r\nI'll try to come up with a simple repo to reproduce, I hope that the description is enough though\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n```\r\n$ ng build --baseHref=/assets/ --deployUrl=https://cdn.com/assets/ --localize\r\n$ head -6 assets/en/index.html \r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n  <base href=\"/assets/en/\">\r\n\r\n$ tail -2 assets/en/index.html\r\n<script src=\"https://www.cdn.com/assets/runtime.f95efe4dfa0fd0cf523c.js\" defer>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.5\r\nNode: 12.16.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.5\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.1.1\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.5\r\n@angular/material                 9.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.3\r\n@nguniversal/builders             9.1.0\r\n@nguniversal/common               9.1.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine       9.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n    \r\nDone in 0.45s.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17737","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Locale is not added to `--deployUrl` flag when using `--localize`\" (#17737)"},{"Id":"619079192","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-15T15:59:34","Actor":"hijiangtao","Number":"17736","RawContent":null,"Title":"Library's non-TypeScript files' changing will not reflect on UI even if `ng serve` recompiled","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nIt will occurs in several angular-cli's version, from v6 to v9.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI use Angular CLI: 9.0.7 in developing my project `excellent-proj`, and it has a dependency, let's call it `@hello`.\r\n\r\nWhen I want to modify codes in `@hello` and debug it inside `excellent-proj`, a cooling workflow should be that I only need to write codes in `@hello` and webpack-dev-server should detects the changing, then rebuild the `@hello` and refresh it also in `excellent-proj`.\r\n\r\nI tried following way to make it works:\r\n\r\n1. use `yalc` to organize library's publish and updates' pushing (from library project to `excellent-proj` project);\r\n2. start `@hello` with something like `nodemon -x 'ng build hello && yalc push'`;\r\n3. start `excellent-proj` with `yalc add @hello` and `ng serve`;\r\n\r\nI can confirmed updates triggered library's rebuilding and the new codes can be found in `excellent-proj`, but something wired is only changes in library's TypeScript files can be seen in pages, changes in html and styles files remains the old ones.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nJust init a Angular project and an Angular library with `angular-cli`, and then add the library to project's dependency.\r\n\r\nIn order to confirm this is not a problem of third-library like `yalc`, I also tried following steps, and you can do too:\r\n\r\n1. `ng build --watch` in `@hello` project;\r\n2. `ng serve` in `excellent-proj` project;\r\n3. Everytime I modified the codes in `@hello`, it will triggered `@hello`'s rebuild, and then I moved `dist/hello` to `excellent-proj`'s `node_modules/@hello` folder;\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n**The above steps will definitely triggered Angular `ng serve`'s recompiling work**, since I got following info when I copy it into project's folder (I also tried `npm link` way too):\r\n\r\n```\r\nDate: 2020-05-15T15:56:47.533Z - Hash: 188263e7942a9f784fcb\r\n5 unchanged chunks\r\n\r\nTime: 547ms\r\n\r\nWARNING in Emitted no files.\r\n\r\n: Compiled successfully.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**But the disappointed thing is that only changes in TypeScript file reflects in UI, not the html files and style files.**\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be the problem of my wrong usage of `ng build` or `ng serve` or somethiing like `cp -r folderA/ folderB/`, since I can see the new content inside project and TypeScript's changing logic, but just without html and style's changing...\r\n\r\n:-(\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.7\r\nNode: 10.18.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: No\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI searched many issues, like  with angular-cli v6, v7, v8 and also v9, such as <https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/2389>, <https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/8168>, <https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/2356>, I think <https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13588> issue is mostly the same as mine, however, it still remains open after more than one year.\r\n\r\nIt seems like an existing issues that not been resolved yet, is it a problem that is still under considered by your team?

The plugin is based on the design introduced by `tsc_wrapped` within Bazel‚Äôs `rules_typescript` and leverages the newly added ngtsc plugin from within the `@angular/compiler-cli` package.  By leveraging the same plugin interface that is used by Bazel, a common interface can be used to access the Angular compiler.  This has benefits to both major build systems and dramatically reduces the necessary code infrastructure to integrate the Angular compiler.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the plugin simplifies and reduces the amount of code within the plugin by leveraging newer TypeScript features and capabilities.  The need for the virtual filesystem has also been removed.  The file replacements capability was the primary driver for the previous need for the virtual filesystem.  File replacements are now implemented using a two-pronged approach.  The first, for TypeScript, is to hook TypeScript module resolution and adjust the resolved modules based on the configured file replacements.  This is similar in behavior to TypeScript path mapping.  The second, for Webpack, is the use of the `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` to facilitate bundling of the configured file replacements.  An advantage to this approach is that the build system (both TypeScript and Webpack) are now aware of the replacements and can operate without augmenting multiple aspects of system as was needed previously.\r\n\r\nThe plugin also introduces the use of TypeScript‚Äôs builder programs.  The current primary benefit is more accurate and simplified dependency discovery.  Further, they also provide for the potential future introduction of incremental build support and incremental type checking.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The deprecated string format for lazy routes is not supported by this plugin.  Dynamic imports are recommended for use with Ivy and are required when using the new plugin.\r\n\r\nPerformance and memory usage have also been improved with these changes.  Initial benchmarking indicates an average ~10% reduction in production build time and a similar ~10% reduction in peak memory usage.  The plugin is also not yet fully optimized.  The next phase of development will introduce performance tracing and support further improvements.  Watch mode is currently slower than the previous plugin and will be further optimized and improved once the performance tracing support is introduced.  Also, parallel type checking is currently not yet integrated which was a primary reason for the previous plugin‚Äôs watch mode performance.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17717","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Ivy-only Webpack ngtsc Plugin\" (#17717)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"619682002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-17T11:48:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"19381","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(checkbox): remove deprecated APIs for version 10","State":"open","Body":"Removes the APIs that were marked as deprecated for v10 in the checkbox module.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGES:\r\n* `MAT_CHECKBOX_CLICK_ACTION` has been removed.

The problem is that the TypeScript compiler API intends to\r\nrely fully on absolute paths, while ng-update and the devkit tree intend\r\nto rely on project-scoped/relative paths.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic as it is straightforward to mix paths up, leading to\r\nunexpected errors. For example, computing a relative path between a devkit\r\npath and an absolute disk path results in a non-existent path.\r\n\r\nTo fix this ambiguity, we improve type safety of paths by using branded\r\nprimitives such as the `@angular-devkit/core` `Path` or an even more\r\nstrict type called `WorkspacePath`. A normal string is considered an\r\nunresolved path and cannot be assigned to a `WorkspacePath`. Similarly a\r\n`WorkspacePath` cannot be assigned to a `string`. This ensures that\r\nresolved paths are not accidentally mixed with unresolved paths, and\r\nthat we can safely pass around unresolved and resolved paths without\r\nloss of their semantics.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a case (and potentially more) where a devkit path and an absolute disk\r\npath result in an incorrectly resolved resource. In CLI apps it's possible to reference\r\nresources through absolute project-scoped paths. e.g. `/src/app/app.component.html`. This has been fixed, and tests have been added (this might be the fix for #19354)\r\n\r\n**Note**: Long-term it would be ideal to implement a TypeScript compiler host that only deals with resolved workspace paths, but this is not possible yet as implementing TypeScript's `readDirectory` host method with a virtual tree is complex (and TS doesn't expose its helpers here).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/19354","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: ensure paths are safely passed around in ng-update\" (#19354)"},{"Id":"618929024","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-15T17:30:32","Actor":"devversion","Number":"19371","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: generate proper anchor ids for headings in markdown","State":"closed","Body":"Currently we compute the anchor ids for headings in guides and\r\noverviews manually.

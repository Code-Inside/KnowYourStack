See `public-api-surface.md`\r\n\r\nWe are changing this because in the current state, for advanced setups like our Bazel infrastructure in Material, this peer dependency can result in a cycle. That is because we may decide to link the `@angular/core` package using the compiler-cli/compiler; while transitively the compiler has a dependency on core. That's a cycle (surfacing in Bazel w/ `rules_js`).\r\n\r\nDropping this optional peer dependency is acceptable because `core`, since recently, also has an optional peer dependency on the compiler. This one makes more sense and is also more user-facing (people generally never install the compiler directly).\r\n\r\nNotably the compiler does not have any runtime dependency on `core` and this was purely added for some safety checking.

On the latest Angular version - 19.2.3 - when switching \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\" mode from \"browser\" to \"application\", my tests lose the ability to load assets. I presume the assets are still served, but couldn't figure out what's the new path is. In the \"browser\" setup, the assets load perfectly fine from the same path as in the full application.\n\nTest builder configuration:\n```json\n\"test\": {\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"main\": \"src/test.ts\",\n            \"include\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\"],\n            \"polyfills\": \"src/polyfills.ts\",\n            \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.spec.json\",\n            \"karmaConfig\": \"karma.conf.js\",\n            \"builderMode\": \"browser\",\n            \"assets\": [\n              \"src/favicon.ico\",\n              \"src/assets\",\n              {\n                \"glob\": \"**/testing/*.png\",\n                \"input\": \"src/app/\",\n                \"output\": \"/test-images/\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"styles\": [\"src/styles.scss\"],\n            \"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\n              \"includePaths\": [\"src/styles\", \"node_modules/\"]\n            },\n            \"scripts\": []\n          }\n        },\n```\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHave a component that uses Mat Icon SVG icons.\n\nMy icon initializer:\n```\nexport const iconsAppInitializer = provideAppInitializer(() => {\n  const iconRegistry = inject(MatIconRegistry);\n  const sanitizer = inject(DomSanitizer);\n  iconRegistry.addSvgIconResolver((name, namespace: string) => {\n    // Namespaces: \"ggcc\", \"material-filled\", \"material-outlined\", \"material-symbols-outlined\"\n    return sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(`assets/images/icons/${namespace}/${name}.icon.svg`);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAuthor a test for the component.\n\nTo load icons in the test, provide these:\n```\n  iconsAppInitializer,\n  provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi()),\n```\n\nRun the test, i.e. `ng test --browsers=ChromiumHeadless --include=**/page-signin.component.spec.ts`.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nNode.js version v23.6.0 detected.\nOdd numbered Node.js versions will not enter LTS status and should not be used for production.

However, it seems that this is only the case when no polyfills files are added.\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.3\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.3\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.3\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.3\n@angular/cli                    19.2.3\n@schematics/angular             19.2.3\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29853","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Native async/await with polyfills file\" (#29853)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2930059620","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T23:25:57","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30650","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/card): move tokens to component directory","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30650","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/card): move tokens to component directory\" (#30650)"},{"Id":"2929364027","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T18:04:14","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30649","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/paginator): change tabindex expect in test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30649","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/paginator): change tabindex expect in test\" (#30649)"},{"Id":"2929355241","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T17:46:56","Actor":"devversion","Number":"30648","RawContent":null,"Title":"Second iteration of `rules_js` migration","State":"open","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30648","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Second iteration of `rules_js` migration\" (#30648)"},{"Id":"2929201598","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T17:38:04","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30647","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: use relative imports within npm packages","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picked version of https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30588 going into the patch branch","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30647","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: use relative imports within npm packages\" (#30647)"},{"Id":"2929012158","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T15:53:53","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30646","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/core): define token overrides inline","State":"open","Body":"Creates CSS variables for the overrides API inline instead of using a new selector rule for each token\r\n\r\n```\r\nhtml {\r\n  @include mat.checkbox-overrides(\r\n    (\r\n      disabled-label-color: orange,\r\n      label-text-color: red,\r\n    )\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nhtml {\r\n  --mat-checkbox-disabled-label-color: orange;\r\n}\r\nhtml {\r\n  --mat-checkbox-label-text-color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nhtml {\r\n  --mat-checkbox-disabled-label-color: orange;\r\n  --mat-checkbox-label-text-color: red;\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30646","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/core): define token overrides inline\" (#30646)"},{"Id":"2920190599","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T15:22:06","Actor":"mistrykaran91","Number":"30631","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/autocomplete): allow overlay backdrop by setting `hasBackdrop` option","State":"closed","Body":"Currently when we open the panel, backdrop is not allowed and is not inline with `mat-select`, `mat-menu`, etc. This fix will align autocomplete with those components and give an option to configure it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #30457","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30631","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/autocomplete): allow overlay backdrop by setting `hasBackdrop` option\" (#30631)"},{"Id":"2928494592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T14:20:53","Actor":"mistrykaran91","Number":"30644","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo in autocomplete by removing redundant word","State":"closed","Body":"Remove `instead` word from autocomplete doc to fix grammatical mistake.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30644","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix typo in autocomplete by removing redundant word\" (#30644)"},{"Id":"2928696124","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T14:18:44","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30645","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(multiple): avoid repeating selectors in m3 themes","State":"open","Body":"In #29596 we switched to outputting each group of tokens under a different selector in order to work around an Sass deprecation warning.

Tip: in \"browse mode\" you can use the \"C\" key to jump to the next combo box in the page\n- make NVDA interact with the select (\"focus mode\") by pressing \"ENTER\" key or with the \"FORCED FOCUS MODE\" key (NVDA + space). You should hear a sound and NVDA speech again \"Favorite food combo box collapsed opens list\"\n- press again enter to expand the select panel to show all possible options\n- optionally, scroll options with down and up arrow keys\n- do not select any option and press the \"ESC\" key. You should hear a \"descending\" sound that means the NVDA \"focus mode\" was deactivated and you are now in \"browse mode\" again\n- using the up and down arrow keys to explore the page, you can see that the NVDA focus was moved down at the bottom of the page (at least for the NVDA virtual dom) and the select is still opened.\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFor reference take the native example where the select should collapse when pressing the \"ESC\" key and the screen-reader focus remains on the select element.\n\nNotice that in Angular Material v14 or v15, the correct behavior is the following:\nwhile the select is open and the screen-reader is in the focus mode, if you press the \"ESC\" key one time the select closes but the focus mode not. Afther that, if you press \"ESC\" again the NVDA focus mode will deactivate and the focus will be placed where it was before you started the interaction.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSame as Reproduction\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 16>\n- CDK/Material: Material\n- Browser(s): Chrome and Firefox (latest)\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n\n<!-- Failed to upload \"Video.mp4\" -->","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30632","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): lose the focus when no selection is made by pressing ESC\" (#30632)"},{"Id":"2916650331","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-14T06:04:15","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30626","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/button): allow appearance to be set dynamically","State":"closed","Body":"Adds the following features to the button:\r\n* Allows the appearance of a button to be set dynamically using the `matButton` input.\r\n* Aligns the terminology with the M3 spec.

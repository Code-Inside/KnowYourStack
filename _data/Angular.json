In `Taiga UI Kit` we have [token factory with effect inside](https://github.com/taiga-family/taiga-ui/blob/main/projects/core/tokens/dark-mode.ts#L43-L51)\n\n[Injecting token](https://github.com/taiga-family/taiga-ui/blob/main/projects/core/directives/dropdown/dropdown.component.ts#L76) `TUI_DARK_MODE` in component produce error:\n\n`NG0602: effect() cannot be called from within a reactive context`. All subsequent clicks result in an error:\n`Circular dependency in DI detected for InjectionToken TUI_DARK_MODE`\n\nIt seems that at the first injection, the factory with the effect is executed and this error is fired. It's strange if you can't use the effect in the token factory, but you can in the constructor. It is treated by wrapping the `effect()` in `untracked()` function\n\nPlease explain this behavior. Is that the plan?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f9105af-b886-48c4-b664-502252a4ca04\" />\n\n```true\nNG0602: effect() cannot be called from within a reactive context\n\nAll subsequent clicks result in an error:\n\nCircular dependency in DI detected for InjectionToken TUI_DARK_MODE\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 17.2.3\nNode: 20.19.4\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 17.2.1\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.14\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.1\n@angular-devkit/core            17.2.1\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.2.1\n@angular/cli                    17.2.3\n@schematics/angular             17.2.1\nrxjs                            7.8.0\ntypescript                      5.3.3\nzone.js                         0.14.3\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63658","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`NG0602: effect() cannot be called from within a reactive context` when using `effect()` in token factory\" (#63658)"},{"Id":"3400263976","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-09T23:08:33","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"63674","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(common): improve typing of `ngComponentOutletContent`","State":"open","Body":"BREAKING CHANGE `ngComponentOutletContent` is now of type `Node[][] | undefined` instead of `any[][]`\r\n\r\nfixes #63538\r\n\r\nThis is a blast range purposes","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63674","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(common): improve typing of `ngComponentOutletContent`\" (#63674)"},{"Id":"3399152819","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-09T22:45:50","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"63663","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: create a script and ci setup for managing and uploading known synonyms for algolia","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63663","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: create a script and ci setup for managing and uploading known synonyms for algolia\" (#63663)"},{"Id":"3399848986","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-09T22:07:24","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63672","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Update tests for zoneless by default","State":"closed","Body":"Cherrypick #63668 into patch branch to avoid issues with tests when merging to patch\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63672","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): Update tests for zoneless by default\" (#63672)"},{"Id":"3399691703","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-09T21:42:00","Actor":"atscott","Number":"63668","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): Update tests for zoneless by default","State":"closed","Body":"This updates tests and examples only to prepare for zoneless by default.\r\n\r\nThese changes were identified and made as part of #63382.

The official example demonstrates a scenario where the `linkedSignal` is updated manually via `.set()`. When the `source` signal subsequently changes, the `computation` function's `previous.value` correctly reflects the value from the manual `.set()`, not the result of the last computation.\n\nThis discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual behavior shown in the example can lead to confusion and incorrect implementation.\n\n\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/signals/linked-signal\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI was looking for a precise definition of the `previous.value` property within the `linkedSignal`'s `computation` function.

This could lead to issues in server-side rendering environments where multiple requests are processed concurrently, as they could inadvertently share or overwrite the global injector state.\r\n\r\nThe new approach introduces a `BootstrapContext` that is passed to the `bootstrapApplication` function. This context provides a platform reference that is scoped to the individual request, ensuring that each server-side render has an isolated platform injector. This prevents state leakage between concurrent requests and makes the overall process more reliable.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\nThe server-side bootstrapping process has been changed to eliminate the reliance on a global platform injector.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```ts\r\nconst bootstrap = () => bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, config);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```ts\r\nconst bootstrap = (context: BootstrapContext) =>\r\n  bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, config, context);\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/31152","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/ssr): introduce BootstrapContext for isolated server-side rendering\" (#31152)"},{"Id":"3399181558","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-09T16:44:49","Actor":"clydin","Number":"31151","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/cli): promote MCP find_examples tool to a stable tool","State":"open","Body":"The `find_examples` MCP tool has undergone significant enhancements, including the implementation of a structured relational database, advanced filtering, weighted search ranking, and snippet support.\r\n\r\nGiven its maturity, robustness, and utility, the tool is now considered stable and is promoted to the default set of enabled tools for the MCP server.

Description\n\nHello,\n\nI am opening this issue because when using `redirectTo` in the `children` of a route, when SSG is enabled, Angular generates a blank page for `index.html`:\n\n```ts\n// app.routes.ts\nexport const routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    component: LayoutComponent,\n    children: [\n      {\n        path: '',\n        pathMatch: 'full',\n        redirectTo:

http-equiv=\"refresh\">` soft redirect as explained in the [documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/ssr#redirects).\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue easily:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/divdavem/angular-router-bug-ssg-redirect\ncd angular-router-bug-ssg-redirect\nnpm ci\nnpm run build\n```\n\nNotice that `dist/myapp/browser/index.html` is empty.\n\n### Please

One component is using the Monaco Editor (ngx-monaco-editor-v2) and the other is using rete and rete-angular-plugin/20 .  The example I'm providing below is using Monaco\n\nThe component with monaco editor works as expected when opened as a normal route in the app.  But, when opening as either a ComponentPortal or TemplatePortal (I tried both ways) the editor acts strangely - the cursor doesn't show, and key commands don't act as expected (ex. backspace will sometimes duplicate a line, space will sometimes create a new line, and I can't place the cursor where I want it) \n\nWith the rete library, same thing - on a normal route, it acts as expected, but in the portal, the mouse drag for the nodes doesn't work, or is heavily delayed, and then will not release from the mouse and will continue to move around.  The  node connections can't be dropped or added, etc.  Function calls still work, however. \n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHere's a sandbox of the issue\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/portal-f5x3ly\n1.

Since I can't show my code, I will be using the example given in the docs to show a few of the weird behaviors I noticed. You can follow along with the [Date range picker forms integration example](https://material.angular.dev/components/datepicker/examples#date-range-picker-forms) in the docs.\n\nI'm sorry for not using the intended way of creating the bug request but I saw no way to report basically identical bugs in one ticket in another way.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n**Link**: see description\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\n#### Bug 1: Start/end stays invalid, then fixed by proxy\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. 9/9/2020 - 9/9/2020)\n2. Set invalid end (e.g. 31/31/2020)\n3. Make end valid by changing start\n=> Expected: end is valid. Actual: end is still marked as invalid. This is because of the default Angular Forms behavior but I wish it would be overridden by DatePicker for these cases for better UX.\n\n#### Bug 2: Any date invalid by itself won't show error message but turn field red\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change day of start/end to e.g. 90 to make it invalid.\n=> Expected: start/end field is marked red and an error message is displayed below. Actual: field is marked red but no error message appears.\n\n#### Bug 3: The only way to make both errors show at the same time is ... weird\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change end date to be earlier than start date\n  - **Expected**: end date marked red (because end < start?) but no error shown as both dates are still valid on their own and no specific mat-error is listed for this case in HTML.\n  - **Actual**: shows end date message (even though both are technically valid by themselves?)\n3. Edit start date to invalid date, then directly back to valid date\n  => Expected: same as above. Actual: shows start and end date message, even though start is now valid again and end date was never invalid by itself? Also, the start message should've appeared when it got invalid, not just now.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Tested with V17 - V20.2.2.

But I am not sure where to file that, and this seems like this should be on the radar for the Material docs users using Firefox.\n\nI was trying to run Material doc examples in Firefox. After messing around, I was able to fix it by commenting out some of the root SCSS. In particular, something about the `@use '@angular/material' as mat` will cause Firefox ran Stackblitz projects to hang on the `\"ng serve --> Building...\"` phase in the terminal and `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\nBelow is what has to be done to any Material styled file to get them to work, nullifying theming.\n\n```scss\n// @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\nbody {\n  font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 30px;\n  height: 100%;\n\n  // @include mat.theme((\n  //   color: (\n  //     theme-type: light,\n  //     primary: mat.$azure-palette,\n  //     tertiary: mat.$blue-palette,\n  //   ),\n  //   typography: Roboto,\n  //   density: 0,\n  // ));\n}\n\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nSame applies to other theming file locations, like in-component styles which are just \n\n```ts\n  styles: `\n    @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n  `,\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \n\n- Broken: 20.1 with styling (won't ever finish building and actually load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\n- Works: 20.1 without styling (will load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi-uz1gcmh1?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\nAdditionally, here are links from the v18 and v19 docs that can pop open a pre-existing Stackblitz with the same issue\n\n- 18: https://v18.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n- 19: https://v19.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open Firefox\n2. Open both links\n3. Observe that \"20.1 without styling\" loads\n4. Observe that \"20.1 with styling\" hangs\n5. Note the difference between both's root `styles.scss`\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nApp serves and loads\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nApp hangs on \"ng serve --> Building...\" in the terminal and the `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\n### Environment\n\nThis applies to any previous version using the new theming API, so v18 and v19 as well as v20.

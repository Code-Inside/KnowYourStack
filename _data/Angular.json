An instance of a `ComponentFactory` resolved via `ComponentFactoryResolver` contained a reference to an `NgModule` where the component is declared. As a result, the component maintained a DI connection with the module injector tree (by retrieving an instance of `NgModuleRef` internally), even when the custom injector was provided (we try to find a token in a custom injector first and consult module injector after that).\r\n\r\nWith Ivy, we expanded the `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` function API to support direct references to the Component classes without going through the factory resolution step. As a result, there was no connection to the NgModule that declares the component. Thus, if you provide a custom injector, this is the only injector that is taken into account.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the logic for the factory-less case to try retrieving an instance of an `NgModuleRef` using the DI tree which `ViewContainerRef` belongs to. The `NgModuleRef` instance is then used to get a hold of a module injector tree. This brings the factory-less and factory-based logic to a consistent state.\r\n\r\nCloses #44897.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44966","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` should consult module injector when custom one is provided\" (#44966)"},{"Id":"1123511849","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-03T23:19:40","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"44964","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: exclude devtools scope from generated changelogs","State":"closed","Body":"The devtools scoped commits are not included in the repository's CHANGELOG.md file as these commits are not references areas which are included in the\r\nprimary released artifacts.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44964","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: exclude devtools scope from generated changelogs\" (#44964)"},{"Id":"1123414991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-03T22:50:27","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"44960","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: setup OpenSSF Scorecard","State":"closed","Body":"Set up OpenSSF Scorecard to begin tracking security metrics within the repo.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/44960","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: setup OpenSSF Scorecard\" (#44960)"},{"Id":"1123540453","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-03T20:56:23","Actor":"dalejodc","Number":"44965","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove unnecessary closing tag in HTTP code example","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is by design, since they are intended to identify specific mistakes often made by developers with clear solutions or best practices. Since these fixes are so mechanical, we should give an easy, automated way to apply them to a diagnostic.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nExtended diagnostics should be able to generate a set of possible \"quick fix\" transformations which IDE's can use to address the diagnostic. In the case of `invalidBananaInBox`, we could automate a change like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div ([foo])=\"bar\">Hello</div>\r\n<!-- Fixes to... -->\r\n<div [(foo)]=\"bar\">Hello</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n@danieltre23 came up with a prototype in https://github.com/danieltre23/angular/commit/52f6a7af6c36ee05eef0c67e159c5a8828a42bc3 and was able to demo the feature. It's a relatively small commit so I don't think this is a significant amount of effort. The work here is to define the \"quick fix\" data type in the compiler, we'll need something custom since we don't want to depend on VSCode / LSP types here (curious how `tsc` does this?). The language service / VSCode extension will then need to transform the \"quick fix\" type into VSCode-compatible \"code actions\", which the IDE can show and apply with a single click.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extended diagnostics quick fix\" (#44941)"},{"Id":"1121498900","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-02T04:31:38","Actor":"Azbesciak","Number":"44940","RawContent":null,"Title":"Provide multiple providers from the single provision","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/releated to the feature request?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi, I wonder whether is it possible to add an option to provide multiple providers by single provision;  this way it is possible to make the app more customizable and inject providers on any level - through `useFactory` and dependency, for example.

[`v0.14.18`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;01418)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.17...v0.14.18)\n\n-   Add the `--mangle-cache=` feature ([#&#8203;1977](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1977))\n\n    This release adds a cache API for the newly-released `--mangle-props=` feature. When enabled, all mangled property renamings are recorded in the cache during the initial build. Subsequent builds reuse the renamings stored in the cache and add additional renamings for any newly-added properties. This has a few consequences:\n\n    -   You can customize what mangled properties are renamed to by editing the cache before passing it to esbuild (the cache is a map of the original name to the mangled name).\n\n    -   The cache serves as a list of all properties that were mangled. You can easily scan it to see if there are any unexpected property renamings.\n\n    -   You can disable mangling for individual properties by setting the renamed value to `false` instead of to a string. This is similar to the `--reserve-props=` setting but on a per-property basis.\n\n    -   You can ensure consistent renaming between builds (e.g. a main-thread file and a web worker, or a library and a plugin). Without this feature, each build would do an independent renaming operation and the mangled property names likely wouldn't be consistent.\n\n    Here's how to use it:\n\n    -   CLI\n\n        ```sh\n        $ esbuild example.ts --mangle-props=_$ --mangle-cache=cache.json\n        ```\n\n    -   JS API\n\n        ```js\n        let result = await esbuild.build({\n          entryPoints: ['example.ts'],\n          mangleProps: /_$/,\n          mangleCache: {\n            customRenaming_: '__c',\n            disabledRenaming_: false,\n          },\n        })\n        let updatedMangleCache = result.mangleCache\n        ```\n\n    -   Go API\n\n        ```go\n        result := api.Build(api.BuildOptions{\n          EntryPoints: []string{\"example.ts\"},\n          MangleProps: \"_$\",\n          MangleCache: map[string]interface{}{\n            \"customRenaming_\":   \"__c\",\n            \"disabledRenaming_\": false,\n          },\n        })\n        updatedMangleCache := result.MangleCache\n        ```\n\n    The above code would do something like the following:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    x = {\n      customRenaming_: 1,\n      disabledRenaming_: 2,\n      otherProp_: 3,\n    }\n\n    // Generated code\n    x = {\n      __c: 1,\n      disabledRenaming_: 2,\n      a: 3\n    };\n\n    // Updated mangle cache\n    {\n      \"customRenaming_\": \"__c\",\n      \"disabledRenaming_\": false,\n      \"otherProp_\": \"a\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Add `opera` and `ie` as possible target environments\n\n    You can now target [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) and/or [Internet Explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer.aspx) using the `--target=` setting. For example, `--target=opera45,ie9` targets Opera 45 and Internet Explorer 9. This change does not add any additional features to esbuild's code transformation pipeline to transform newer syntax so that it works in Internet Explorer. It just adds information about what features are supported in these browsers to esbuild's internal feature compatibility table.\n\n-   Minify `typeof x !== 'undefined'` to `typeof x < 'u'`\n\n    This release introduces a small improvement for code that does a lot of `typeof` checks against `undefined`:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    y = typeof x !== 'undefined';\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    y=typeof x!=\"undefined\";\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    y=typeof x<\"u\";\n    ```\n\n    This transformation is only active when minification is enabled, and is disabled if the language target is set lower than ES2020 or if Internet Explorer is set as a target environment. Before ES2020, implementations were allowed to return non-standard values from the `typeof` operator for a few objects. Internet Explorer took advantage of this to sometimes return the string `'unknown'` instead of `'undefined'`. But this has been removed from the specification and Internet Explorer was the only engine to do this, so this minification is valid for code that does not need to target Internet Explorer.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>csstools/postcss-plugins</summary>\n\n### [`v7.3.1`](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/blob/HEAD/plugin-packs/postcss-preset-env/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;731-February-3-2022)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/compare/51bfb76c1c427bd953f4816dab4ea1c759b60a85...15a2fbaf6330ed49d76af5b1f60d2ace92e83349)\n\n-   Ensured that `debug` option uses a single instance per run, this allows for `debug` to work on parallel runs within CI environments.\n-   Normalized exports to support both Common JS and ESM within our modules.

install script issue on Ubuntu Linux ([#&#8203;1711](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1711))\n\n    There have been some reports of esbuild failing to install on Ubuntu Linux for a while now. I haven't been able to reproduce this myself due to lack of reproduction instructions until today, when I learned that the issue only happens when you install node from the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/) instead of downloading the [official version of node](https://nodejs.org/dist/).\n\n    The problem appears to be that when node is installed from the Snap Store, install scripts are run with stderr not being writable? This then appears to cause a problem for esbuild's install script when it uses `execFileSync` to validate that the esbuild binary is working correctly. This throws the error `EACCES: permission denied, write` even though this particular command never writes to stderr.\n\n    Node's documentation says that stderr for `execFileSync` defaults to that of the parent process. Forcing it to `'pipe'` instead appears to fix the issue, although I still don't fully understand what's happening or why. I'm publishing this small change regardless to see if it fixes this install script edge case.\n\n-   Avoid a syntax error due to `--mangle-props=.` and `super()` ([#&#8203;1976](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1976))\n\n    This release fixes an issue where passing `--mangle-props=.` (i.e. telling esbuild to mangle every single property) caused a syntax error with code like this:\n\n    ```js\n    class Foo {}\n    class Bar extends Foo {\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The problem was that `constructor` was being renamed to another method, which then made it no longer a constructor, which meant that `super()` was now a syntax error. I have added a workaround that avoids renaming any property named `constructor` so that esbuild doesn't generate a syntax error here.\n\n    Despite this fix, I highly recommend not using `--mangle-props=.` because your code will almost certainly be broken. You will have to manually add every single property that you don't want mangled to `--reserve-props=` which is an excessive maintenance burden (e.g. reserve `parse` to use `JSON.parse`). Instead I recommend using a common pattern for all properties you intend to be mangled that is unlikely to appear in the APIs you use such as \"ends in an underscore.\" This is an opt-in approach instead of an opt-out approach. It also makes it obvious when reading the code which properties will be mangled and which ones won't be.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack-dev-server</summary>\n\n### [`v4.7.4`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;474-httpsgithubcomwebpackwebpack-dev-servercomparev473v474-2022-02-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v4.7.3...v4.7.4)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I am suggesting that we definitely don't do that as we risk contaminating production database. Here is a scenario:\r\n1. I have 2 servers: staging and production. Each with unique CI and firebase database configured\r\n2. I use ng build and ng build --prod on each CI respectively. Thinking that each will build development and production respectively..\r\n3. I deploy both apps, without knowing that both servers are configured to use the same PRODUCTION firebase database\r\n4. App is live. I onboard a QA.\r\n5. QA creates or DELETES random data during testing, hence contaminating the production database\r\n\r\nAs you can see it opens up the possibility of connecting production database to staging environments because the developer trusts that ng build will not blindly build production, especially since it has always been the case that you needed --prod.\r\n\r\nI get that many users forgot to use --prod, hence this solution was implemented, but it can be dangerous to production apps. I strongly recommend we revert this change and resort to printing out glaringly obvious console messages if user forgets to use --prod.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nDon't build production by default on ng build.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22618","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng build SHOULD NOT use prod environment by default.

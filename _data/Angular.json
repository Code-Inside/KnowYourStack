The fix was a breaking change, so a configuration option, `callSetDisabledState`, was also introduced to provide a way to opt into the old, \"legacy\" behavior. The bug fix also caused a problem for radio buttons that was [subsequently fixed](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48864/) by making the radio CVA default to using the \"legacy\" behavior. However, if you use the configuration option to opt into the legacy behavior (i.e. `callSetDisabledState = 'whenDisabledForLegacyMode'`), the radio CVA **uses the non-legacy behavior**. Here is a visual matrix of the scenarios:\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/7282195/34dbc0db-c823-4a34-b0b5-7437a752070e)\r\nThis does not make sense. There is no reason that using `'whenDisabledForLegacyMode'` should make the radio CVA use a non-legacy, problematic behavior.\r\n\r\n[The code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b76b3c619bc2ff9ffdd436559a7550398a810b10/packages/forms/src/directives/radio_control_value_accessor.ts#L223) is straightforward. It should just not include `|| callSetDisabledState === 'whenDisabledForLegacyMode'` in the condition.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please

This could include a call to `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges`. There is no way to create a render hook that only runs when the global change detection is triggered (i.e. `ApplicationRef.tick`). \r\n\r\nThis is especially problematic for `afterNextRender` when the intent is almost always to run after the next global change detection or \"after rendering _this_ component\". The problem is that there might be a `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges` call before the global `ApplicationRef.tick` might happen. This would mean that the component may not have been change detected/rendered when the hook runs.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a property to the `AfterRenderOptions` to only run the hook after a _global_ change detection (`ApplicationRef.tick`) rather than running it on _any_ change detection (`ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges`).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThere's no alternative at the moment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53232","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add option to `afterRender*` hooks to only run on global change detection\" (#53232)"},{"Id":"2014949398","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-28T17:37:49","Actor":"viniciuscvbs","Number":"53231","RawContent":null,"Title":"Link to angular cli commands is broken","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nIn the [main CLI page](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) the \"Command Reference\" link is broken.

If cmd is launched from the run window (WIN+R, \"cmd\") it builds fine. After some head scratching I realized that if I capitalize the drive letter in the \"start in\" property of the shortcut it builds fine (`C:\\some\\path\\here`).\r\n\r\nThis project was upgraded from 15.2.9 to 16 and then to 17 the following day. The issue wasn't discovered until it was upgraded to v17, but I'm not positive it didn't exist in 16 as I didn't try running the build from the offending shortcut.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI originally found this error on a large app that has been upgraded through several versions of Angular, but I was able to reproduce this with a freshly created app using the latest CLI (17.0.4)\r\n\r\n- Open a fresh command window directly (WIN+R, \"cmd\", enter) which should give you an upper case drive letter in the prompt\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd \\junk\r\nng new repro-app\r\ncd repro-app\r\nnpm run build\r\n# builds successfully\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Create a shortcut to cmd  ( `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` )\r\n- Right click > Properties\r\n- Set \"Start in\" to a path starting with a lower case drive letter (`c:\\junk\\repro-app`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run build\r\n# fails with below error about main.ts and polyfills.ts not being part of the project\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nFile 'src\\main.ts' is missing from the TypeScript compilation.

This should be more familiar for people coming from other similar tools, as well as make better use of large screens.\n\n-   Allow decorators after the `export` keyword ([#&#8203;104](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/104))\n\n    Previously esbuild's decorator parser followed the original behavior of TypeScript's experimental decorators feature, which only allowed decorators to come before the `export` keyword. However, the upcoming JavaScript decorators feature also allows decorators to come after the `export` keyword. And with TypeScript 5.0, TypeScript now also allows experimental decorators to come after the `export` keyword too. So esbuild now allows this as well:\n\n    ```js\n    // This old syntax has always been permitted:\n    @&#8203;decorator export class Foo {}\n    @&#8203;decorator export default class Foo {}\n\n    // This new syntax is now permitted too:\n    export @&#8203;decorator class Foo {}\n    export default @&#8203;decorator class Foo {}\n    ```\n\n    In addition, esbuild's decorator parser has been rewritten to fix several subtle and likely unimportant edge cases with esbuild's parsing of exports and decorators in TypeScript (e.g. TypeScript apparently does automatic semicolon insertion after `interface` and `export interface` but not after `export default interface`).\n\n-   Pretty-print decorators using the same whitespace as the original\n\n    When printing code containing decorators, esbuild will now try to respect whether the original code contained newlines after the decorator or not. This can make generated code containing many decorators much more compact to read:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;a @&#8203;b @&#8203;c abc\n      @&#8203;x @&#8203;y @&#8203;z xyz\n    }\n\n    // Old output\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;a\n      @&#8203;b\n      @&#8203;c\n      abc;\n      @&#8203;x\n      @&#8203;y\n      @&#8203;z\n      xyz;\n    }\n\n    // New output\n    class Foo {\n      @&#8203;a @&#8203;b @&#8203;c abc;\n      @&#8203;x @&#8203;y @&#8203;z xyz;\n    }\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.6.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#460)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.5.2...v4.6.0)\n\n*2023-11-26*\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Allow `this.addWatchFile` in all plugin hooks ([#&#8203;5270](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5270))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Show helpful error when native binaries are not installed due to an `npm` issue ([#&#8203;5267](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5267))\n-   Do not access `this` context in `this.addWatchFile` so it does not need to be bound when passed around ([#&#8203;5270](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5270))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5267](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5267): Add friendly error for npm bug ([@&#8203;sapphi-red](https://togithub.com/sapphi-red))\n-   [#&#8203;5270](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5270): Allow this.addWatchFile in all hooks ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;5272](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5272): Debug deployed graphs ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.28.1`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v5.28.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v5.28.0...v5.28.1)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   perf: Improve `normalizeMethod` by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2456](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2456)\n-   fix: dispatch error handling by [@&#8203;ronag](https://togithub.com/ronag) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2459](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2459)\n-   perf(request): optimize if headers are given by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2454](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2454)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v5.28.0...v5.28.1\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.3`](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small503-2023-11-28-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v5.0.2...v5.0.3)\n\n-   fix: `generateCodeFrame` infinite loop ([#&#8203;15093](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15093)) ([6619de7](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/6619de7)), closes [#&#8203;15093](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15093)\n-   fix: js fallback sourcemap content should be using original content ([#&#8203;15135](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15135)) ([227d56d](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/227d56d)), closes [#&#8203;15135](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15135)\n-   fix(css): render correct asset url when CSS chunk name is nested ([#&#8203;15154](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15154)) ([ef403c0](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/ef403c0)), closes [#&#8203;15154](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15154)\n-   fix(css): use non-nested chunk name if facadeModule is not CSS file ([#&#8203;15155](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15155)) ([811e392](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/811e392)), closes [#&#8203;15155](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15155)\n-   fix(dev): bind plugin context functions ([#&#8203;14569](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14569)) ([cb3243c](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/cb3243c)), closes [#&#8203;14569](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14569)\n-   chore(deps): update all non-major dependencies ([#&#8203;15145](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15145)) ([7ff2c0a](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/7ff2c0a)), closes [#&#8203;15145](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15145)\n-   build: handle latest json-stable-stringify replacement ([#&#8203;15049](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15049)) ([bcc4a61](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/commit/bcc4a61)), closes [#&#8203;15049](https://togithub.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15049)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Since there's only one way to load it, these changes switch to doing so automatically. Loading the API automatically also enables us to optimize the component further in a follow-up PR by showing a placeholder image.\r\n\r\nIf users don't want the API to be loaded automatically, they can disable it through an input or using the newly-introduced `YOUTUBE_PLAYER_CONFIG` injection token.\r\n\r\nFixes #17037.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** there was an earlier attempt at this feature in #21401 which didn't land due to some concerns around API loading.

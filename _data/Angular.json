This process includes appending a `-\\d+` suffix to some paths/URLs (for example, `/.../inject-1`). Unfortunately, some of the Firebase redirects configured in `firebase.json` would match these URLs and redirect them to non-existing paths.\r\nExample failures: [stable][1], [next][2]\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nThis was not picked up in the regular CI tests run for PRs, because the local devserver and the preview server used to test PRs do not support Firebase-like redirects.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by ensuring these disambiguated paths/URLs are not matched by the redirect rules by checking whether the part of the suffix after the `-` contains any numeric digits. While this check is not ideal, it should be good enough for our purpose, since the legacy URLs that we do want to redirect contain suffixes such as `-class`, `-function` and thus no numeric digits.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes related infrastructure/testing fixes to allow implementing the fix.

I am passing a service method in the template container context. In the template I have another templatable container where I am calling passed method. This works fine with default and custom templates. However, when I try to test if the passed in the context method is called in the custom template the test fails with `Expected spy myMethodName to have been called`. When I debug the test I can see the method is called but jasmine's spy somehow miss this.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n[Here](https://github.com/wnvko/teamplateAngular12) is a repo containing a sample.

It replaces the 5+ year old internals with a new low-level parser: [`micromark`][micromark]. The old internals have served billions of users well over the years, but markdown has changed over that time. micromark comes with 100% CommonMark (and GFM as an extension) compliance, and (WIP) docs on parsing rules for how to tokenize markdown with a [state machine][cmsm]. micromark, and micromark in remark, is a good base for the future.\n\n#### Migration\n\n-   Update all the `remark*` packages you are using in `package.json`\n-   Did you use GFM (tables and so, used to be the default)? Now add [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   Try running it all. If it fails, you are probably using a [syntax extension which hasn‚Äôt been updated yet][plugins], there are issues open on the issue trackers of those plugins already\n-   Compare the previous output to the new output: anything wrong? See below for the changelog which might cover it. Otherwise, It‚Äôs probably because remark is now CommonMark (or GFM) compliant.\n    Please compare with those projects if the new behavior is correct or not ([CommonMark Dingus](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/), or [create a gist](http://gist.github.com/new) for GFM).\n    Does remark not match those reference parsers? Please open an issue here!\n\n#### Changes\n\n##### remark-parse\n\n`remark-parse` now defers its work to [`micromark`][micromark] and [`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown]. `micromark` is a new, small, complete, and CommonMark compliant low-level markdown parser. `from-markdown` turns its tokens into the previously (and still) used syntax tree: [mdast][]. Extensions to `remark-parse` work differently: they‚Äôre a two-part act. See for example [`micromark-extension-footnote`][micromark-footnote] and [`mdast-util-footnote`][from-markdown-footnote].\n\n-   change: `commonmark` is no longer an option ‚Äî it‚Äôs the default\n-   move: `gfm` is no longer an option ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   remove: `pedantic` is no longer an option ‚Äî this legacy and buggy flavor of markdown is no longer widely used\n-   remove: `blocks` is no longer an options ‚Äî it‚Äôs no longer suggested to change the internal list of HTML ‚Äúblock‚Äù tag names\n\n##### remark-stringify\n\nremark-stringify now defers its work to [`mdast-util-to-markdown`][to-markdown]. It‚Äôs a new and better serializer with powerful features to ensure serialized markdown represents the syntax tree (mdast), no matter what plugins do. Extensions to it work differently: see for example [`mdast-util-footnote`][to-markdown-footnote].\n\n###### `options`\n\n-   change: `commonmark` is no longer an option, it‚Äôs the default\n-   change: `emphasis` now defaults to `*`\n-   change: `bullet` now defaults to `*`\n-   move: `gfm` is no longer an option ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `tableCellPadding` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `tablePipeAlign` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   move: `stringLength` ‚Äî moved to [`remark-gfm`][gfm]\n-   remove: `pedantic` is no longer an option ‚Äî this legacy and buggy flavor of markdown is no longer widely used\n-   remove: `entities` is no longer an option ‚Äî with CommonMark there is almost never a need to use character references, as character escapes are preferred\n-   new: `quote` ‚Äî you can now prefer single quotes (`'`) over double quotes (`\"`) in titles\n\n##### Changes to output / the tree\n\nAll of these are for CommonMark compatibility. They‚Äôre all fixes. Most of them are inconsequential to most folks.\n\n-   **notable**: references (as in, links `[text][id]` and images `![alt][id]`) are no longer present as such in the syntax tree if they don‚Äôt have a corresponding definition (`[id]: example.com`). The reason for this is that CommonMark requires `[text *emphasis\n    start][undefined] emphasis end*` to be emphasis.\n-   **notable**: it is no longer possible to use two blank lines between two lists or a list and indented code. CommonMark prohibits it. For a solution, use an empty comment to end lists (`<!---->`)\n-   inconsequential: whitespace at the start and end of lines in paragraphs is now ignored\n-   inconsequential: `<mailto:foobarbaz>` are now correctly parsed, and the scheme is part of the tree\n-   inconsequential: indented code can now follow a block quote w/o blank line\n-   inconsequential: trailing indented blank lines after indented code are no longer part of that code\n-   inconsequential: character references and escapes are no longer present as separate text nodes\n-   inconsequential: character references which HTML allows but CommonMark doesn‚Äôt, such as `&copy` w/o the semicolon, are no longer recognized\n-   inconsequential: the `indent` field is no longer available on `position`\n-   fix: multiline setext headings\n-   fix: lazy lists\n-   fix: attention (emphasis, strong)\n-   fix: tabs\n-   fix: empty alt on images is now present as an empty string\n-   ‚Ä¶plus a ton of other minor previous differences from CommonMark\n\n##### Thanks\n\nThanks to [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and

If however the community feels strongly that we should move ahead on a more aggressive timeline, or if there are reasons to delay the actual removal further, we'd like to hear from you. Please provide the arguments and use cases in comments below.\r\n\r\nThis RFC will close on May 10, 2021.\r\n\r\n# The benefits\r\n\r\nAngular is an evergreen platform, meaning that it stays up to date with the evolving Web ecosystem. By removing support for legacy browsers we can focus our efforts on providing modern solutions and better support to developers and users.\r\n\r\nThere are several groups of stakeholders that will benefit from the removal of IE11 support:\r\n\r\n- Application users\r\n  - the apps will be smaller and load faster thanks to the removal of IE11-specific code\r\n  - the use of modern Web APIs will result in further UX improvements\r\n\r\n- Application authors\r\n  - will benefit from improved APIs and build infrastructure\r\n  - can lean on our decision as an argument when talking to application stakeholders about IE11 support (if they still support it)\r\n\r\n- Library authors\r\n  - can lean on our decision and drop IE11 support in their libraries as well (if they still support it)\r\n\r\n- Angular team\r\n  - We'll be able to remove special JS and CSS code paths, polyfills, build passes, and dev infrastructure that exists only because we support IE11.\r\n  - Since IE11 is the last non-evergreen browser we support, we'll gain access to many new modern web APIs and features that have been around for years, but we couldn't use them due to IE11 support and limitations to polyfilling. These APIs include:\r\n    - CSS Variables, Intersection Observers, CSS Grid ([components/issues#7374](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/7374))\r\n    - Native version of EcmaScript APIs (e.g. [regexp](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e7453f15d5b6925ff7be30993882f0c4a712eb71/packages/common/src/pipes/case_conversion_pipes.ts#L44-L54))\r\n    - Web animation APIs\r\n    - Proxies\r\n    - etc\r\n\r\n\r\n# Background information\r\n## Microsoft support\r\n\r\nIE11 was initially released almost 8 years ago, in 2013, and since that time, it has been receiving only bug and security fixes. It was superseded by Microsoft Edge, which unlike IE11 is an evergreen browser, which automatically receives feature updates including web platform API enhancements.\r\n\r\nOn August 17, 2020 [Microsoft announced deprecation of IE11 support in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666) apps and services, with the removal date set for August 17, 2021. Microsoft Teams already removed support for IE11 on November 30, 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Web API feature gap\r\n\r\nThe difference in Web APIs & features supported by IE11 compared to evergreen (modern) browsers is too vast to list in this RFC, and can instead be [reviewed at caniuse.org](https://caniuse.com/?compare=ie+11,edge+90,firefox+89,chrome+93,safari+14&compareCats=all).\r\n\r\n## Browser usage\r\n\r\n![StatCounter-browser-ww-monthly-202103-202103-bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/216296/116285933-86bb4780-a743-11eb-9e9f-a2fc1075f6cb.png)\r\n\r\nsource: [statcounter.com](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-202103-202103-bar)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1217\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-26 at 10 32 44 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/216296/116285961-90dd4600-a743-11eb-9084-2ed8e29a275b.png\">\r\n\r\nsource: [netmarketshare.com](https://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Custom%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22browserVersion%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22browsersDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222021-03%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222021-03%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41840","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RFC: Internet Explorer 11 support deprecation and removal\" (#41840)"},{"Id":"868257373","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-27T17:23:28","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"41825","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(dev-infra): add github token requirement for discover-new-conflicts","State":"closed","Body":"Add the github token option/requirement for the pr discover-new-conflicts\r\ncommand.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41825","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(dev-infra): add github token requirement for discover-new-conflicts\" (#41825)"},{"Id":"868706518","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-27T17:16:59","Actor":"ahasall","Number":"41835","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove the section \"Using components vs services from other modules\"","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Before app bootstrap.\r\n2. During HTTP calls.\r\n\r\nThe second is fine, but the first appears to be a real problem.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to use a technique that allows to put content inside `<app-root></app-root>` in `index.html`, which disappears after app bootstrap.\r\n\r\nWhile simple `<app-root>Loading...</app-root>` works well, I didn't find any way to use custom component instead of plain `Loading...` text.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples like the following, but, as I said, I don't want to duplicate code, so, markup and styles are in one place.\r\n```\r\n<app-root>\r\n  <style>/* fancy styles */</style>\r\n  <div><!-- fancy markup --></div>\r\n</app-root>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWhat have I tried:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n```\r\n// app.module.ts\r\nimports: [SpinnerModule]\r\n\r\n// index.html\r\n<app-root>\r\n  <loading-spinner></loading-spinner>\r\n</app-root>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing happens. It seems that component wasn't shown at all.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n```\r\n// app.module.ts\r\nimports: [SpinnerModule]\r\n\r\n// index.html\r\n<app-root>\r\n  <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"spinner\"></ng-container>\r\n</app-root>\r\n<ng-template #spinner>\r\n  <loading-spinner></loading-spinner>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing happens. It seems that component wasn't shown at all.\r\n\r\n3. \r\n```\r\n// app.module.ts\r\nimports: [SpinnerModule],\r\nbootstrap: [SpinnerComponent]\r\n\r\n// index.html\r\n<app-root></app-root>\r\n<loading-spinner></loading-spinner>\r\n\r\n// main.ts\r\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).then((): void => {\r\n  const loadingSpinner: Element = document.getElementsByTagName('loading-spinner')[0];\r\n  document.body.removeChild(loadingSpinner);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent was shown for a second, but it seems that it appeared together with `AppComponent`. I double checked this by wrapping `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)` with `setTimeout()`. In this case it doesn't make sense to show it at all, since it should be shown **during** `AppComponent` load, not **after**.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nWell, I'd need to either abandon showing the spinner before app bootstrap or duplicate its markup and styles in both `loading-spinner.component.html` and `index.html`. I was also thinking that maybe it's possible to kind of pre-compile `SpinnerComponent`, but I'm not sure how to do that.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41823","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Show Custom Component Inside Root or as Root Sibling Before Bootstrap\"

The Angular event model is covered here.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] WRT _\"The template variable, `#editedItem`, on the `<input>` means that Angular stores whatever a user types in this `<input>` in a variable called `editedItem`.\"_\r\n  This is not very accurate. Angular stores a reference to the `<input>` element in `editedItem`. (From that, we can access whatever the user has typed in the `<input>` via the element's `value` property: `editedItem.value`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Suggestion:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -on communication the `AppComponent` and the `ItemComponent`\r\n  +on communication of/between the `AppComponent` and the `ItemComponent`\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] Suggestion:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -Configure the AppComponent first\r\n  +Configure the `AppComponent` first\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] WRT _\"this.allItems.splice(this.allItems.indexOf(item), 1);\"_:\r\n  This is not a safe way to remove an item, because if the item is not in the list, then the last item will be removed.\r\n  A better way is `this.allItems = this.allItems.filter(otherItem => otherItem !== item);`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Suggestion:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -remove one item at at the `indexOf` the relevant item\r\n  +remove one item at the `indexOf` the relevant item\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] WRT _\"which is bound to the `remove` property in the `ItemComponent`\"_:\r\n  This is a little confusing imo. It gives the impression that you can somehow bind methods to arbitrary child-component properties, which is not true. `ItemComponent#remove` is not a regular property; it is an `@Output`.\r\n  Maybe change that clause to _\"which is bound to the `remove` output in the `ItemComponent`\"_\r\n\r\n- [ ] WRT _\"The following CSS adds basic styles, flexbox for the buttons, and custom checkboxes.\"_:\r\n  This is a little confusing as well, since the styles below have very little to do with Flexbox for buttons. Maybe we meant _\"colors for buttons\"_?\r\n\r\n\r\n##\r\nIn [Filtering our to-do items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Angular_filtering):\r\n\r\n- [ ] Nit:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -filter == 'all'/'active'/'done'\r\n  +filter === 'all'/'active'/'done'\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nIn [MDN: Building Angular applications and further resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Angular_building):\r\n\r\n- [ ] Suggestion:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -**Objective:**\tTo learn how to build your Angular app.\r\n  -**Objective:**\tTo learn how to build and deploy your Angular app.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] Suggestion:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -ng  build --prod\r\n  +ng build --prod\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] I think it would be worth mentioning the various deploy schematics that allow you to deploy your app to various backends (sudh as GitHub pages, Firebase, Netlify, etc.) with a single command.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41811","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs: comments/suggestions/typos for the Angular tutorials on MDN\" (#41811)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"869079765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-27T19:16:25","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"20637","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add `debounceTime` to stabilize FS","State":"closed","Body":"(cherry picked from commit a8ff9d408b82ff73b79ae2d3441510a3286bca82)\r\n\r\nThis fixes CI","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20637","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add `debounceTime` to stabilize FS\" (#20637)"},{"Id":"869178265","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-27T19:10:19","Actor":"clydin","Number":"20638","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/cli): correct various uncaught code style issues","State":"open","Body":"This change cleans up some of the CLI code by removing unused variables/imports, unnecessary double negation, and some long line lengths.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20638","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@angular/cli): correct various uncaught code style issues\" (#20638)"},{"Id":"868864140","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-27T15:38:03","Actor":"clydin","Number":"20635","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update prettier configuration and ignore files","State":"closed","Body":"Quoted properties are now configured to be preserved within code and is needed for cases of closure compiler usage.\r\nThe ignore files list is also updated to now ignore all directories that contain code that should not be formatted;

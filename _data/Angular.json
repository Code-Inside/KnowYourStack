This diagnostic helps developers catch such issues early, improving accessibility and code clarity.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Triggers warning -->\r\n<div [attr.aria-label]=\"'Label'\" [ariaLabel]=\"'Ignored'\"></div>\r\n<input\r\n  type=\"checkbox\"\r\n  role=\"textbox\"\r\n  [ariaKeyShortcuts]=\"'Alt+Shift+A'\"\r\n  [attr.aria-keyshortcuts]=\"'Alt+Shift+B'\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```text\r\nNG8118: Multiple bindings found for '[aria-keyshortcuts]'.

When both bindings exist for the same ARIA attribute, Angular silently prioritizes [attr.aria-*] and ignores the [ariaX] binding.

There's no native atomic move API in the browser. So this results in the element being detached and attached at its new index. The detaching of the node resulted in leave animations firing. This fix addresses this by adding a flag in the `LView[ANIMATIONS]` `AnimationLViewData` interface to allow for skipping animations. During list reconciliation, we set this flag so that the animations are skipped over. The flag is flipped back after the move operation is complete.\r\n\r\nThere is one complication that results from this. The index adjustment of elements in the list happens synchronously while the leave animation is asynchronous. This results in the leaving item getting shifted to the end of the list. This is not ideal but likely can be addressed in a future refactor.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/583bb5ca-23e7-40d0-84e3-9a4b89f9cc01\r\n\r\nfixes: #63544\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/63745","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): Prevent leave animations on a move operation\" (#63745)"},{"Id":"3407744085","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-11T21:18:33","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"63742","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies to v21.0.0-next.3 (main)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | [`21.0.0-next.2` -> `21.0.0-next.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fcdk/21.0.0-next.2/21.0.0-next.3) | [![age](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/age/npm/@angular%2fcdk/21.0.0-next.3?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/adoption/npm/@angular%2fcdk/21.0.0-next.3?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/compatibility/npm/@angular%2fcdk/21.0.0-next.2/21.0.0-next.3?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/confidence/npm/@angular%2fcdk/21.0.0-next.2/21.0.0-next.3?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components) | [`21.0.0-next.2` -> `21.0.0-next.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/21.0.0-next.2/21.0.0-next.3) | [![age](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/age/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/21.0.0-next.3?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![adoption](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/adoption/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/21.0.0-next.3?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![passing](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/compatibility/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/21.0.0-next.2/21.0.0-next.3?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) | [![confidence](https://developer.mend.io/api/mc/badges/confidence/npm/@angular%2fmaterial/21.0.0-next.2/21.0.0-next.3?slim=true)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/merge-confidence/) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components (@&#8203;angular/cdk)</summary>\n\n### [`v21.0.0-next.3`](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#2100-next3-red-envelope-2025-09-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/components/compare/21.0.0-next.2...21.0.0-next.3)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### material\n\n- -

away the diagnostic on the other line:\n<img width=\"697\" height=\"496\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f08867ba-3b0e-46b7-bdeb-54760560eb2d\" />\n\nMinimal repro

Avoids duplication of markup and logic across components. You maintain one table shell and inject only what's unique.\n2. Promotes better collaboration and encapsulation. The table component handles layout and styling; consumers handle data logic for common patterns\n3.

One component is using the Monaco Editor (ngx-monaco-editor-v2) and the other is using rete and rete-angular-plugin/20 .  The example I'm providing below is using Monaco\n\nThe component with monaco editor works as expected when opened as a normal route in the app.  But, when opening as either a ComponentPortal or TemplatePortal (I tried both ways) the editor acts strangely - the cursor doesn't show, and key commands don't act as expected (ex. backspace will sometimes duplicate a line, space will sometimes create a new line, and I can't place the cursor where I want it) \n\nWith the rete library, same thing - on a normal route, it acts as expected, but in the portal, the mouse drag for the nodes doesn't work, or is heavily delayed, and then will not release from the mouse and will continue to move around.  The  node connections can't be dropped or added, etc.  Function calls still work, however. \n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHere's a sandbox of the issue\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/portal-f5x3ly\n1.

Since I can't show my code, I will be using the example given in the docs to show a few of the weird behaviors I noticed. You can follow along with the [Date range picker forms integration example](https://material.angular.dev/components/datepicker/examples#date-range-picker-forms) in the docs.\n\nI'm sorry for not using the intended way of creating the bug request but I saw no way to report basically identical bugs in one ticket in another way.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n**Link**: see description\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\n#### Bug 1: Start/end stays invalid, then fixed by proxy\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. 9/9/2020 - 9/9/2020)\n2. Set invalid end (e.g. 31/31/2020)\n3. Make end valid by changing start\n=> Expected: end is valid. Actual: end is still marked as invalid. This is because of the default Angular Forms behavior but I wish it would be overridden by DatePicker for these cases for better UX.\n\n#### Bug 2: Any date invalid by itself won't show error message but turn field red\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change day of start/end to e.g. 90 to make it invalid.\n=> Expected: start/end field is marked red and an error message is displayed below. Actual: field is marked red but no error message appears.\n\n#### Bug 3: The only way to make both errors show at the same time is ... weird\n1. Set valid start & valid end (e.g. same as above)\n2. Change end date to be earlier than start date\n  - **Expected**: end date marked red (because end < start?) but no error shown as both dates are still valid on their own and no specific mat-error is listed for this case in HTML.\n  - **Actual**: shows end date message (even though both are technically valid by themselves?)\n3. Edit start date to invalid date, then directly back to valid date\n  => Expected: same as above. Actual: shows start and end date message, even though start is now valid again and end date was never invalid by itself? Also, the start message should've appeared when it got invalid, not just now.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: Tested with V17 - V20.2.2.

But I am not sure where to file that, and this seems like this should be on the radar for the Material docs users using Firefox.\n\nI was trying to run Material doc examples in Firefox. After messing around, I was able to fix it by commenting out some of the root SCSS. In particular, something about the `@use '@angular/material' as mat` will cause Firefox ran Stackblitz projects to hang on the `\"ng serve --> Building...\"` phase in the terminal and `\"Installing dependencies\"` step of the container loader.\n\nBelow is what has to be done to any Material styled file to get them to work, nullifying theming.\n\n```scss\n// @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n\nbody {\n  font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 30px;\n  height: 100%;\n\n  // @include mat.theme((\n  //   color: (\n  //     theme-type: light,\n  //     primary: mat.$azure-palette,\n  //     tertiary: mat.$blue-palette,\n  //   ),\n  //   typography: Roboto,\n  //   density: 0,\n  // ));\n}\n\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nSame applies to other theming file locations, like in-component styles which are just \n\n```ts\n  styles: `\n    @use '@angular/material' as mat;\n  `,\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \n\n- Broken: 20.1 with styling (won't ever finish building and actually load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\n- Works: 20.1 without styling (will load on Firefox): https://stackblitz.com/edit/yypvtgbi-uz1gcmh1?file=src%2Fexample%2Fautocomplete-auto-active-first-option-example.ts\n\nAdditionally, here are links from the v18 and v19 docs that can pop open a pre-existing Stackblitz with the same issue\n\n- 18: https://v18.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n- 19: https://v19.material.angular.dev/components/autocomplete/examples\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

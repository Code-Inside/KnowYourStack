`submit()` is supposed to do regarding to validation.\nBut currently, it does something that doesn't seem correct to me: it doesn't call the callback function if the form is invalid, but it does call it if the form is pending (i.e. even though we doesn't know if it's valid yet).\n\nThat looks weird to me: if an async validator is still executing, we don't know is the form is valid yet, so we shouldn't send the form to the server.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the

debounce","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nIn certain scenarios using `@defer` together with `viewChildren` signal query might lead to a lot of computation that could be avoided if creation of components inside a defer block could be batched together or `viewChildren` would have a debounce functionality.\n\nWhat I observed is when using defer block with on viewport the components are all created one after the other.\nAs I pick them up view `viewChildren` signal every creation of a component triggers the signal. This might cause a lot of unwanted computation.\n\nI tried to solve this by adding a minimum to the loading block, but that didn't change the behavior.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow adding a minimum time or batch time to the defer block. Something like this\n```\n@defer(on viewport; batch 100ms) {\n}\n```\nThis would batch all defer blocks that come to life into one update cycle.\n\nAn alternative could be to allow debouncing viewChildren signal.\n```\ncomp = viewChildren(DeferedComponent, {debounce: 100})\n```\nWhich would only trigger a signal update every 100ms, so all changes in this time will show up as one.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nImplement own component instantiation for this use cases that works similar to defer blocks but created components inside a visible area all at once.

I am aware this is more in the realm of a support request, but this request is somewhat bespoke and really requires a response from a core team member. I am exploring migrating Cypress Component Testing support from `webpack` via `@angular-devkit/build-angular` to the newer `@angular/build` using esbuild/vite and have several questions. I used GPT to organize my questions below. If there is a better medium to ask this question, please let us know!\n\n# Angular Build System Migration: Questions for Angular Core Team\n\n## Overview\n\nCypress Component Testing currently supports Angular Component Testing applications through `@cypress/webpack-dev-server`, which directly integrates with `@angular-devkit/build-angular`'s webpack configuration. As Angular has moved to the new `@angular/build` system (which uses Vite with esbuild), we need guidance on how to migrate our integration to support the new build system while maintaining compatibility with existing Angular projects.\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n### How Cypress Uses `@angular-devkit/build-angular`\n\nCypress currently integrates with Angular by directly importing and using webpack configuration functions from `@angular-devkit/build-angular`. The implementation is located in [`npm/webpack-dev-server/src/helpers/angularHandler.ts`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/webpack-dev-server/src/helpers/angularHandler.ts).\n\n#### Key Integration Points\n\n1. **Direct Module Imports**: We dynamically import Angular's webpack configuration utilities:\n   ```typescript\n   const angularCLiModules = [\n     '@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/utils/webpack-browser-config.js',\n     '@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/common.js',\n     '@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/tools/webpack/configs/styles.js',\n     '@angular-devkit/core/src/index.js',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Webpack Config Generation**: We use `generateBrowserWebpackConfigFromContext` to generate a webpack configuration:\n   ```typescript\n   const { config } = await generateBrowserWebpackConfigFromContext(\n     buildOptions,\n     context,\n     (wco: any) => {\n       const stylesConfig = Promise.resolve(getStylesConfig(wco)).then((config) => {\n         // Custom modifications for Cypress\n         return config\n       })\n       return [getCommonConfig(wco), stylesConfig]\n     },\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Fake Builder Context**: We create a minimal context object that mimics Angular's builder context:\n   ```typescript\n   const context = {\n     target: { project: 'angular' },\n     workspaceRoot: projectRoot,\n     getProjectMetadata: () => ({ root, sourceRoot, projectType: 'application' }),\n     logger,\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Configuration Merging**: The generated Angular webpack config is merged with Cypress-specific webpack configuration (entry points, plugins, etc.) and then used to launch `webpack-dev-server`.\n\n#### What This Approach Provides\n\n- **Automatic Configuration**: We inherit all of Angular's webpack configuration (loaders, plugins, optimizations, etc.)\n- **Compatibility**: Works with Angular's build options from `angular.json`\n- **Maintenance**: As Angular updates its webpack config, we automatically benefit from those changes\n- **Customization**: Users can still override the webpack config via Cypress configuration\n\n## Desired State: Migration to `@angular/build`\n\n### Goal\n\nWe want to migrate to using `@angular/build` (which uses Vite with esbuild) so that we can use `@cypress/vite-dev-server` instead of `@cypress/webpack-dev-server` for Angular component testing. This would provide:\n\n- **Performance**: Vite's faster dev server and HMR\n- **Consistency**: Align with Angular's new build system direction\n- **Modern Tooling**: Benefit from esbuild's speed and Vite's ecosystem\n\n### Current `@cypress/vite-dev-server` Architecture\n\nOur Vite dev server works by:\n1. Sourcing Vite from the user's project dependencies\n2. Resolving or accepting a Vite configuration\n3. Merging user config with Cypress-specific config (plugins, entry points, etc.)\n4. Creating and launching a Vite dev server\n\nFor reference, see [`npm/vite-dev-server/src/resolveConfig.ts`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/vite-dev-server/src/resolveConfig.ts).\n\n## Technical Challenges\n\n### Architecture Differences\n\n1. **Build System Integration**:\n   - `@angular-devkit/build-angular`: Exposes webpack config generation functions that we can call directly\n   - `@angular/build`: Uses Vite internally via [`serveWithVite()`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/builder.ts#L59) but doesn't expose a way to extract just the Vite configuration\n\n2. **Builder Context Requirements**:\n   - `@angular-devkit/build-angular`: We can create a minimal fake context\n   - `@angular/build`: The [`serveWithVite()`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/builder.ts#L59) function requires a full `BuilderContext` from `@angular-devkit/architect`. Are we able to use a similar approach?\n\n3. **Configuration Extraction**:\n   - In `@angular/build`, the Vite configuration is created in `setupServer()` (see [`packages/angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite/server.ts`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular/build/src/builders/dev-server/vite/server.ts))\n   - This function is internal and not exported for external use.\n   - The Vite server is created and managed within the builder's execution flow\n\n### Key Questions\n\n1. **Is there a supported way to extract the Vite configuration** that `@angular/build:dev-server` would use, similar to how we can extract webpack config from `@angular-devkit/build-angular`? I'm not sure the current method is recommended, but having a way to extract the Vite config from a public interface would be extremely helpful.\n\n2. **Can we reuse `setupServer()` or similar functions** to generate a Vite `InlineConfig` that we can then merge with Cypress-specific configuration?\n\n3. **Should we use the builder directly** (e.g., call `executeDevServerBuilder` programmatically) and somehow integrate it with our dev server, or is there a better approach? This would be fairly challenging for us to accomplish reliably.\n\n4. **What's the recommended migration path** for tools like Cypress that need to integrate with Angular's build system for component testing? Should we even be using `@angular/build` instead of `@angular-devkit/build-angular` or is it recommended to use a different method?\n\n5. **Are there any plans for a public API** that would allow tools to programmatically get the Vite configuration that Angular would use, without having to run the full dev server builder?\n\n## Proposed Approach (Seeking Feedback)\nWe're considering a few potential approaches:\n\n### Option A: Extract Vite Config from Builder\n- Use `@angular/build`'s internal functions (if accessible) to generate the Vite config\n- Merge with Cypress-specific config\n- Create our own Vite dev server instance. The Cypress app today currently needs control over the Vite process\n\n### Option B: Use Builder with Custom Integration\n- Programmatically invoke the Angular dev server builder while being able to pass specific configuration options\n- Intercept or proxy the Vite server it creates via a plugin approach, which would be fairly disruptive to our process\n- Integrate with Cypress's test execution flow\n\n## Questions for Angular Team\n\n1. **What is the recommended approach** for tools that need to integrate with Angular's build system for component testing when using `@angular/build`?\n\n2. **Is there a public API or function** we can use to get the Vite configuration that `@angular/build` would generate, without running the full builder?\n\n3. **Would it be feasible to export** functions like `setupServer()` or create a new public API for generating Vite configurations?\n\n4. **Are there any examples** of other tools successfully integrating with `@angular/build` for similar use cases?\n\n5. **What is the timeline** for `@angular/build` becoming the default/recommended build system, and when should tools like Cypress prioritize migration? Cypress is aware that `@angular-devkit/build-angular` is still supported according to the [migration documentation](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration), but know eventually webpack will be phased out for esbuild/Vite.\n\n6. **Are there any compatibility concerns** we should be aware of when trying to reuse Angular's Vite configuration in a different context (Cypress's dev server)?\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- **Cypress Component Testing**: Allows developers to test individual Angular components in isolation\n- **Current Support**: Works with Angular 18-20 (Angular 21 support coming soon) using webpack-based builds\n- **User Impact**: Many Cypress users rely on Angular component testing, so a smooth migration path is important\n- **Repository**: [cypress-io/cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe're eager to collaborate with the Angular team to find the best migration path.

Observe the issue: After scrolling, the left nav items no longer highlight when you drag over them.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n* When dragging an item over the left nav, the corresponding item should highlight, regardless of whether the user has scrolled the left nav.\n* The `cdkDropListEntered` and `cdkDropListExited` events should fire correctly according to the cursor position, even after scrolling, and even when the dropList and scrollable container are not in a parent-child relationship.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n* When dragging over the left nav items without scrolling, the highlight works as expected and the events fire.\n* After scrolling the left nav or the source page, the events stop firing, and the highlight does not update.\n* This occurs even though  the scrollable container use the `cdkScrollable` directive when the containers are implemented as separate components (not parent-child).\n\n### Environment\n\n- **Angular:**\n- **CDK/Material:** 20.2.13\n- **Browser(s):** Chrome 141.0.7390.13\n- **Operating System:** Chrome OS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/32376","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(drag-drop): cdkDropListEntered and cdkDropListExited events do not fire after scrolling when dropList is not a child of cdkScrollable container\" (#32376)"},{"Id":"3636430431","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-18T06:46:53","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32373","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/menu): allow conditional inlining of menu popover","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32373","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/menu): allow conditional inlining of menu popover\" (#32373)"},{"Id":"3636057895","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-18T04:22:55","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"32372","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/menu): enable inline popover","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/32372","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(cdk/menu): enable inline popover\" (#32372)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-11-25T03:30:02.9985166Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2127}

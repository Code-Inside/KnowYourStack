However, there was an explicit `!== null` check that was triggered, outputting an undefined ref. The algorithm explicitly returns `null` now.\r\n- The function formatting that adds parentheses broke some of the base cases.

When effect.run() executes, it may trigger synchronous view destruction or component cleanup that sets view[EFFECTS] to null, causing subsequent loop iterations to fail with \"not iterable\" errors.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, production logs in Rollbar showed frequent \"not iterable\" errors originating from this function. However, due to code mangling in production builds and the asynchronous nature of effect execution, reproducing and identifying the root cause was extremely difficult. The core issue is that effects can trigger cleanup operations that nullify view[EFFECTS] while the effect flushing loop is running, making it unsafe to assume view[EFFECTS] remains non-null after the initial check.\r\n\r\nCreating a reliable test case for this race condition is nearly impossible due to the specific timing and execution context required to trigger the cleanup during effect execution.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/65698","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(core): guard against view[EFFECTS] being nullified during effect execution\" (#65698)"},{"Id":"3672421316","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-27T16:55:02","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"65695","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): Show examples on function overloads","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this change, @example jsdoc tags funtion overloads weren't displayed in the API docs.

In such cases, if these services are storing data, there could be context loss during navigation or loading a different module. \n\nPlease see the example in this [online demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5bpkv2fa?file=src%2Fmain.ts,src%2FpageA.component.ts,src%2FpageB.component.ts,src%2Fcommon.service.ts)\n\nIn the example, the standalone components `Page A` and `Page B` are injecting the same service `CommonService` and share the same instance, but the component `Page C` has a different instance running of the same service. This could be because the service is provided in the providers array. The service, whether it is `providedIn: 'root'` or `providedIn: 'platform'` does not maintain the same instance, it could possibly be a bug.\n\nHowever, the component `Page B` now has access to two different instances and may choose any one, based on its priority or pathway. The issue that I faced (not reproducible in this example) was, when navigating from `Page A` to `Page B`, the `Page B` component preferred the instance from the `Page C` module. So, the `Page B` component was not able to access the data set by `Page A` as it was a different instance. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nShow a warning if any component is trying to inject a service that may have multiple instances at runtime or might be resolved through multiple pathways. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI have removed the service from providers array of all modules and standalone components ensuring a single instance of the service is available at run time and that could solve the issue, but it's still dangerous as any module or component in the pathway might create a different instance causing context loss.

With NgModules this complexity was encapsulated: consumers imported one module and were done.\n\nBut with standalone components, this changed. Now, library consumers needed to import every individual piece manually — which wasn’t great for DX. IDEs like WebStorm started suggesting dozens of imports, and that quickly got annoying.\n\nTo restore a single, ergonomic entry point, we group related declarations into `as const` arrays.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nexport const TuiTextfield = [\n  TuiLabel,\n  TuiTextfieldComponent,\n  TuiTextfieldDirective,\n  TuiTextfieldOptionsDirective,\n] as const;\n```\n\nThis keeps the public API compact: the IDE suggests one symbol, while the array still contains all necessary pieces.\n\nMore background:  \nhttps://medium.com/angularwave/watching-angular-evolve-taiga-ui-kit-maintainers-perspective-97d2dd56b607#72b2\n\n**Why spread support is important?**<br />\n\nThe non-spread workaround:\n\n```diff\n- export const UserFriendlyImport = [...BaseEntities, MoreComplexEntity] as const;\n+ export const UserFriendlyImport = [BaseEntity1, BaseEntity2, MoreComplexEntity] as const;\n```\n\nBut in real-world projects with dozens of components and directives, manually listing each one becomes cumbersome and error-prone. The spread operator allows us to maintain modularity and reusability without sacrificing developer experience.\n\nJust explore how we have to violate DRY in Taiga UI now only for textfield components:\n* https://github.com/taiga-family/taiga-ui/pull/12671\n\nThat PR shows extra duplication just for one type of components. With dozens of similar components, the maintenance overhead becomes significant. Supporting spread-merged arrays in `imports` would allow Angular libraries to stay modular and maintainable without sacrificing DX.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/65686","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Failure to resolve exported spread-merged array of cooperating directives between Angular libraries\" (#65686)"},{"Id":"3670431097","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-27T08:44:33","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"65685","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler): ensure all href and src attributes are sanitized as URLs","State":"open","Body":"Previously, the security schema listed specific elements for `href`, `xlink:href`, and `src` attributes to be sanitized as URLs.

Arguably, they seem like they should be `TValue | undefined` from the FormControlValue interface.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nChanging the internal properties for min/max to different names with aliased min/max attributes.

builder.  \nThis happens because Angular generates extremely long output filenames for test source maps, which include the **full absolute path** of the component under test.\n\nOn macOS (and some CI environments), the filesystem limits paths to **255 characters**, and the generated spec map paths exceed this limit.\n\n### Example error\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n\nWhen the project structure is nested (common in enterprise monorepos), the combined absolute path of the repo + project + feature modules + filename becomes extremely long (300–390+ chars).\n\nThis makes the test runner fail with `ENAMETOOLONG` before execution even starts.\n\n### Impact\n- Test builds cannot run on macOS  \n- CI pipelines fail  \n- Refactoring large monorepos becomes extremely difficult  \n- Developers must manually shorten folder structures even when logically correct  \n\n---\n\n## ✔ **Suggested solutions**\n\n### **Option 1 — Shorten or hash test output paths**\nEmit something like:\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n\ninstead of embedding the entire directory path.\n\n### **Option 2 — Add a configuration flag (e.g. `\"shortPath\": true`)**\nSomething

CommonJS imports are no longer supported.\n\nIf you're on modern Node versions (≥ 20), this should be transparent and have no impact.\n\n##### Node.js Version Requirement\n\n**Minimum Node.js version is now 20.x**\n\nNode.js versions below 20 are no longer supported. Please upgrade to Node.js 20 or later.\n\nNode min versions: `>=23.5.0 || ^22.13.0 || ^21.7.0 || ^20.12.0`\n\n##### Deprecated APIs Removed\n\nThe following deprecated APIs have been removed after being deprecated in previous releases:\n\n##### `list` prompt alias removed (affects `inquirer` package only)\n\nThe `list` alias has been removed from the `inquirer` package. This only impacts users of the legacy `inquirer` package, not users of `@inquirer/prompts` or individual prompt packages.\n\n```js\n// ❌ No longer available (inquirer package only)\nimport inquirer from 'inquirer';\nconst answer = await inquirer.prompt([\n  { type: 'list', name: 'choice', message: 'Pick one:', choices: ['a', 'b'] }\n]);\n\n// ✅ Use 'select' instead\nimport inquirer from 'inquirer';\nconst answer = await inquirer.prompt([\n  { type: 'select', name: 'choice', message: 'Pick one:', choices: ['a', 'b'] }\n]);\n```\n\n##### `helpMode` theme property removed\n\n```js\n// ❌ No longer available\nconst answer = await select({\n  theme: { helpMode: 'never' }\n});\n\n// ✅ Use theme.style.keysHelpTip instead\nconst answer = await select({\n  theme: {\n    style: {\n      keysHelpTip: () => undefined // or your custom styling function\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis affects the following prompts:\n\n- `@inquirer/checkbox`\n- `@inquirer/search`\n- `@inquirer/select`\n\n##### `instructions` config property removed\n\n```js\n// ❌ No longer available\nconst answer = await checkbox({\n  instructions: 'Custom instructions'\n});\n\n// ✅ Use theme.style.keysHelpTip instead\nconst answer = await checkbox({\n  theme: {\n    style: {\n      keysHelpTip: (text) => 'Custom instructions'\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis affects the following prompts:\n\n- `@inquirer/checkbox`\n- `@inquirer/search`\n- `@inquirer/select`\n\n##### `cancel()` method removed\n\nThe `cancel()` method on prompt return custom `Promise` has been removed.\n\n```js\n// ❌ No longer available\nconst answerPromise = input({ message: 'Name?' });\nanswerPromise.cancel();\nconst answer = await answerPromise;\n\n// ✅ Use AbortSignal instead\nconst controller = new AbortController();\nconst answer = await input(\n  { message: 'Name?' },\n  { signal: controller.signal }\n);\ncontroller.abort();\n```\n\n##### Color Library Change: yoctocolors → Node.js `styleText`\n\n**Internal change:** The project now uses Node.js built-in `util.styleText()` instead of the `yoctocolors` package for terminal colors. This makes Inquirer smaller and reduces risks of vulnerabilities coming from transitive dependencies.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

We currently cannot ship `@pnpm/exe` as `pkg` doesn't work with ESM [#&#8203;10190](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10190).\n- Node.js runtime is not added to \"dependencies\" on `pnpm add`, if there's a `engines.runtime` setting declared in `package.json` [#&#8203;10209](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10209).\n- The installation should fail if an optional dependency cannot be installed due to a trust policy check failure [#&#8203;10208](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10208).\n- `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` now display npm: protocol for aliased packages (e.g., `foo npm:is-odd@3.0.1`) [#&#8203;8660](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8660).\n- Don't add an extra slash to the Node.js mirror URL [#&#8203;10204](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10204).\n- `pnpm store prune` should not fail if the store contains Node.js packages [#&#8203;10131](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10131).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

After i try to run the app locally it just throws me error in browser console :  Uncaught TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null right at the line of service extends baseService{\nmore or less the same issue like in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27991#issue-2388955540 just in my case if i disable AOT everything works with no issues . Checked for circular deps and there is no any , checked for barel exports and also none , tried multiple days to debug deleting and combining diferent versions of libs etc... nothing works . Also checked all the official update procedures and docs , nothing similar is mentioned thre .\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCant share any of the code so not sure how helpful will this be but in general i have huge app with multiple modules and services working together . The problem lies somewhere in services that are extending base service , as soon as you remove one reported the other one that extends base service is reported . This is not happening when AOT is set to false but really hard to debug lost already a week already. Beside that all other fns when AOT is set to false works as expected with all the latest libs and angular updated to v20 so i Assume it has to be issue somewhere in compiler , or not even the issue but some new feature not documented correctly for those usecases .\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nUncaught TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\n```\n\n### Your

This is basically the same bug as https://github.com/blueprintui/web-test-runner-jasmine/issues/25.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI found this via code inspection. I haven't been able to get Angular's web-test-runner integration working at all. The only setup instructions I've found are from the [Angular 17.1 announcement](https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-17-1-release/). They're incomplete, bit-rotted, and look like they might not have worked even when new.\n\nThat said, unless there's a second reporter hiding out somewhere in Angular's integration that handles suite-level failures, I'm pretty confident that adding this spec file to a working Angular web-test-runner setup will reproduce the problem:\n\n\n```\ndescribe('a suite', function() {\n\tit('a spec', function() {});\n\n\tafterAll(function() {\n\t\tthrow new Error('nope');\n\t});\n});\n\nafterAll(function() {\n\tthrow new Error('nope');\n});\n```\n\nThe output should indicate that both the top suite and the \"a suite\" suite failed with the corresponding exceptions. Based on reading the code I think that Angular's implementation, like blueprintui/web-test-runner-jasmine, will indicate an overall status of failed without providing any specifics about the failures.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n/ \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\n                |___/\n    \n\n\nAngular CLI: 20.3.12\nNode: 20.19.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n    \n\nAngular: 20.3.13\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.2003.12\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   20.3.12\n@angular-devkit/core            20.3.12\n@angular-devkit/schematics      20.3.12\n@angular/build                  20.3.12\n@angular/cli                    20.3.12\n@schematics/angular             20.3.12\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.9.3\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nJasmine reports these failures via the `failedExpectations` property of the `suiteDone` and `jasmineDone` reporter events. [Angular's integration](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/212ebdebdd4d5af4920131ec3dea9762cff390ea/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/web-test-runner/jasmine_runner.js) ignores `failedExpectations` in `jasmineDone` and doesn't implement `suiteDone` at all.\n\nThese error paths have been present since jasmine-core 2.1 and jasmine-core 2.5 respectively.

In fact it is optional\n\n```createSpyObj(baseName (opt), methodNames, propertyNames (opt))```, see https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.12/jasmine.html\n\nCurrently something like\n\n```ts\nconst loggerSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj<LoggingService>(['error']);\n```\n\nis transformed to\n```ts\n// TODO: vitest-migration: jasmine.createSpyObj called with a single argument is not supported for transformation.

We currently cannot ship `@pnpm/exe` as `pkg` doesn't work with ESM [#&#8203;10190](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10190).\n- Node.js runtime is not added to \"dependencies\" on `pnpm add`, if there's a `engines.runtime` setting declared in `package.json` [#&#8203;10209](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10209).\n- The installation should fail if an optional dependency cannot be installed due to a trust policy check failure [#&#8203;10208](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10208).\n- `pnpm list` and `pnpm why` now display npm: protocol for aliased packages (e.g., `foo npm:is-odd@3.0.1`) [#&#8203;8660](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8660).\n- Don't add an extra slash to the Node.js mirror URL [#&#8203;10204](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10204).\n- `pnpm store prune` should not fail if the store contains Node.js packages [#&#8203;10131](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10131).\n\n##### Platinum Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://bit.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/bit.svg\" width=\"80\" alt=\"Bit\"></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Gold Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://discord.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/discord.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"Discord\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://coderabbit.ai/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/coderabbit.svg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"CodeRabbit\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://workleap.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/workleap.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Workleap\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <picture>\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" />\n            <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz_light.svg\" />\n            <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/stackblitz.svg\" width=\"190\" alt=\"Stackblitz\" />\n          </picture>\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://vite.dev/?utm_source=pnpm&utm_medium=release_notes\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\"https://pnpm.io/img/users/vitejs.svg\" width=\"42\" alt=\"Vite\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 6am and before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, Friday\" in timezone Europe/Rome, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

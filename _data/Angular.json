Then, by using \"npm link\" inside the dist folder of each lib we are able to add them to our machine's NPM registry. This allow us to go to inside each applications and run \"npm link my-lib\", creating a seamless connection between local apps and local libs . This setup helps speed up the development process, since changes to the libs will trigger it to be recompiled, which then triggers the applications to be recompiled, leading to a quick browser update. This work setup is efficient, clean, and has worked for years. However, once I updated my whole infrastructure to Angular 18, that workflow stopped working. It turns out, it seems that Angular 18 stopped supporting the symbolic links generated by \"npm link my-lib.\" That is is a big issue, because I cannot bring all apps and libs inside the same project or repo (mono repo). They belong to different organizations and must be kept separated. Also, deploying my libs to a remote npm registry every time I need to test a code change to the libs would make it very impractical.\n\nWould it be possible for the Angular team (or Angular CLI team) to bring back the ability to use \"npm link\" on Angular projects?\n\nI am sure you had reasons to drop that feature, but it is quite important for many people I know.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your help on this! =)\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nTerminal 1)\n$: cd my-lib\n$: ng build my-lib\n$: cd dist/my-lib\n$: npm link\n$: cd -\n$: ng serve\n\nTerminal 2)\n$: ng new myApp\n$: cd myApp\n$: npm link my-lib-name\n$: ng serve\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.6\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 18.2.6\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\n... forms, google-maps, localize, platform-browser\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.6\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.6\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.6\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.6\n@schematics/angular             18.2.6\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nThis is a Critical issue, as it is significantly impacting the work of many teams.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28575","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Using \"npm link\" with Angular 18\" (#28575)"},{"Id":"2565941644","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-04T13:26:05","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28573","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: fix typo in directory name","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28573","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: fix typo in directory name\" (#28573)"},{"Id":"2566364187","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-04T13:19:48","Actor":"Raul52","Number":"28574","RawContent":null,"Title":"When using Angular with SSR without prerender there is no index.html generated","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nAngular 16\n\n### Description\n\nI stumbled upon an issue and I do not know what is the expected outcome\n\nI am using Angular 18 with @angular/pwa\n\nInside `ngsw-config.json` , inside the assets group, you can find the initial `app` group.\n\nBy default, the content of the asset group is the following\n\n```\n    {\n      \"name\": \"app\",\n      \"installMode\": \"prefetch\",\n      \"resources\": {\n        \"files\": [\n          \"/favicon.ico\",\n          \"/index.html\",\n          \"/manifest.webmanifest\",\n          \"/*.css\",\n          \"/*.js\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nIf you use Angular with SSR and prefetch false, you will **not** get the `index.html` file in the dist folder.

As you know those libraries are native in nodejs build in and does not support browser environment, so there we have to use polyfills for them like `crypto-browserify` and `stream-browserify`. With `webpack` we could create paths in the `tsconfig` file and everything worked great.\n\nUnfortunately this is not working well for esbuild and there are already a few related bug which where just solved in part, also one from my side [#26901](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26901)\n\nThe solution proposed here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26901#issuecomment-1907045285 by @clydin worked great for production build but it didnt work for dev server as I and also `xkx-dev` pointed out here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26901#issuecomment-1913624658\n\n\nI have created an plain angular project with the real minimum requirements to run into a similar issue, which means the `stream` is not available on dev server.\nBut If I run exactly the same code as production build, everything is fine. So it looks like dev server ignores somehow libs/paths declared in the browser field of the package.json file\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nHere the repository\nhttps://github.com/mburger81/angular-crypto-esbuild\n\nthis is my browser field\n ```\n\"browser\": {\n    \"crypto\": \"crypto-browserify\",\n    \"stream\": \"stream-browserify\",\n    \"os\": \"os-browserify\",\n    \"https\": \"https-browserify\",\n    \"http\": \"stream-http\",\n    \"url\": \"url\"\n  }\n```\n\nAnd in the app.component.ts file I run a very simple example\n\n```\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';\nimport * as crypto from 'crypto';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [RouterOutlet],\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrl: './app.component.css'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'angular-crypto-esbuild';\n\n  key: Buffer;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.key = crypto.createHash('sha256').update('token').digest();\n    console.log('Key:', this.key);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\nvar Transform = require('stream').Transform;\n\nTransform is undefined and this is the thrown exception\n\nERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')\n    at Hash.CipherBase

error:\n\n```\nError: It looks like your application or one of its dependencies is using i18n.\nAngular 9 introduced a global `$localize()` function that needs to be loaded.\nPlease run `ng add @angular/localize` from the Angular CLI.\n(For non-CLI projects, add `import '@angular/localize/init';` to your `polyfills.ts` file.\nFor server-side rendering applications add the import to your `main.server.ts` file.)\n```\n\nMy polyfills are:\n\n`\"polyfills\": [\"@angular/localize/init\"],`\n\nDisabling `\"outputMode\": \"server\"` helps, also i found a solution to start the server with this option too:\n\n1) Comment all $localize fn usages and all routes\n2) Start dev server\n3) Uncomment all $localize fn usages & routes\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCan't reproduce it yet on clean

This was not happening on Angular CDK 17.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: Angular components docs: https://material.angular.io/cdk/tree/examples#cdk-tree-nested-level-accessor\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click on a parent node (e.g. \"Fruit\")\n2. Click on a nested child node (e.g. \"Apple\")\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect the nodes to be expanded or collapsed only when I click an element with the `cdkTreeNodeToggle` directive. But it seems to expand/collapse whenever I click anywhere in the sub-DOM of the `cdk-nested-tree-node`, including child nodes.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nClicking on child nodes collapses the parent node. Also, clicking on a part of the node that is not the `cdkTreeNodeToggle` collapses the node.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 17\n- CDK/Material: 17\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29830","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(CdkTree): Clicking on nested tree nodes collapses parent tree node\" (#29830)"},{"Id":"2566972986","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-04T18:01:09","Actor":"amysorto","Number":"29829","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/chips): Add missing padding to basic chips in M3","State":"open","Body":"Before:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98d9676f-859a-4313-9233-bf3d740d04dd)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09cd14bc-76de-4ad1-b7d3-1626d4480972)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29829","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/chips): Add missing padding to basic chips in M3\" (#29829)"},{"Id":"2565750992","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-04T12:03:09","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Stepper forms integrations fixes","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a couple of issues with the integration between the CDK stepper and the forms module.\r\n\r\n### fix(cdk/stepper): remove mock of forms type\r\nPreviously we were mocking out the `AbstractControl` type, because we didn't want to bring in additional code for the optional forms integration.

That element and it's children will not be able to be dragged/not cause the cdkDrag'ed item to be dragged. \n\n\nAs an alternative to a new directive, It should be possible to accomplish the same goal without adding a new directive by making it so that a cdkDragHandle that's disabled, inside another cdkDragHandle, (or a cdkDrag that's disabled inside another cdkDrag), will result in that element being un-dragable. As it stands, a cdkDrag in a cdkDrag will result in the parent one being moved, and a cdkDragHandle in a cdkDragHandle has no impact. I'm not sure how changing the interactions like that needs to be considered from an API stability point, and I'm also unsure if that's an acceptable option as it is not very intuitive. \n\n### Use Case\n\nThis is specifically targeted at parts of a component/component tree that have interactive elements of their own. (or where one might wish there to be interactivity)\n\n- Text inputs: Unable to highlight the text on an input with a mouse.\n- Text Area: Unable to change the size of a text area input as dragging the anchor in the bottom right corner results in the node moving instead\n- Sliders: Sliders become difficult/nearly impossible to use\n- Simply Highlighting text: Highlighting text in an element becomes difficult as the node itself will move instead of allowing the text to be selected.\n\nThis was discussed previously in #12929 and there was a response of \"You can use the cdkDragHandle directive to configure which element should be draggable\". The complexity of certain draggable components makes this nearly untenable under some circumstances unfortunately. \n\nIf I need to disable dragging on a single sibling element, I have to add cdkDragHandle to all other siblings of that element, all siblings of the element's parent, the parents parent, and so on until I reach the root dragable element itself. That process alone does not account for any margin on the element, which would have to be replaced with margin elements that also have cdkDragHandle, or other such hacks.\n\nThis only gets more complicated and unweildly the more elements you have that require disabling of the dragging.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(cdkDrag): cdkDragExclude to mark a part of the tree as should not be\" (#29827)"},{"Id":"2558306828","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-04T07:16:31","Actor":"marcingryczon","Number":"29805","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-menu): axe a11y report throws aria-expanded not allowed issue","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOur axe a11y reports throws issue points to mat-menu aria-expanded as not allowed:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1211\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 08 21 04\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdc66e0b-d726-4df3-9b80-4fe3a4cde112\">\r\n\r\nIs there any way to use this component without aria-expanded?

The new component uses a combination of an `input` and a dropdown to allow users to either type a time or select it from a pre-defined list. Example usage:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field>\r\n  <mat-label>Pick a time</mat-label>\r\n  <input matInput [matTimepicker]=\"picker\"/>\r\n  <mat-timepicker #picker/>\r\n  <mat-timepicker-toggle [for]=\"picker\"/>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeatures of the new component include:\r\n* Automatically parses the typed-in value to a date object using the current `DateAdapter`. Existing date adapters have been updated to add support for parsing times.\r\n* Time values can be generated either using the `interval` input (e.g. `interval=\"45min\"`) or provided directly through the `options` input.\r\n* Integrated into `@angular/forms` by providing itself as a `ControlValueAccessor` and `Validator`.\r\n* Offers built-in validation for minimum, maximum and time formatting.\r\n* Offers keyboard navigation support.\r\n* Accessibility implemented using the combobox + listbox pattern.\r\n* Can be used either with `mat-form-field` or on its own.\r\n* Can be combined with `mat-datepicker` (docs to follow, see the dev app for now).\r\n* Includes test harnesses for all directives.\r\n* Works with Material's theming system.\r\n* Can be configured globally through an injection token.\r\n* Can be used either as an `NgModule` or by importing the standalone directives.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why did it take so long?\r\nOne of the main reasons why we hadn't provided a timepicker component until now was that there's no \r\nuniversally-accepted design for what a timepicker should look like.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn't Material Design have a timepicker?\r\nMaterial Design has had a [specification for a timepicker](https://m3.material.io/components/time-pickers/overview) for years, but we didn't want to implement it because:\r\n1. This design is primarily geared towards mobile users on Android. It would look out of place in the desktop-focused enterprise UIs that a lot of Angular developers build.\r\n2. The time dial UI is complicated and can be overwhelming, especially in the 24h variant.\r\n3. The accessibility pattern is unclear, users may have to fall back to using the inputs.\r\n4. It's unclear how the time selection would work on non-Westernized locales whose time formatting isn't some variation of `HH:MM`.\r\n5. The time dial requires very precise movements if the user wants to select a specific time between others (e.g. 6:52). This can be unusable for users with some disabilities.\r\n6. The non-dial functionality (inputs in a dropdown) don't add much to the user experience.\r\n\r\nThere are [community implementations](https://dhutaryan.github.io/ngx-mat-timepicker) of the dial design that you can install if you want it for your app.\r\n\r\n#### What are some alternate designs that you considered?\r\nSome libraries like [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dateinputs/timepicker), [Ignite UI](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/time-picker) or [MUI](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/time-picker/), as well as Chrome's implementation of `<input type=\"time\"/>` appear to have settled on a multi-column design for the dropdown. We didn't want to do something similar because:\r\n1. The selected state is only shown using one sensory characteristic (color) which is problematic for accessibility. While we could either add a second one (e.g. a checkbox) or adjust the design somehow, we felt that this would make it look sub-optimal.\r\n2. The UI only looks good on smaller sizes and when each column has roughly the same amount of text. Changing either for a particular column can throw off the whole UI's appearance.\r\n3. It requires the user to tab through several controls within the dialog.\r\n4. It's unclear how the time selection would work on non-Westernized locales whose time formatting isn't some variation of `HH:MM`.\r\n5. Each column requires a lot of filler whitespace in order to be able to align the selected states to each other which can look off on some selections.\r\n\r\n#### Why this design?\r\nWe chose the current design, because:\r\n1. Users are familiar with it, e.g. Google Calendar uses something similar for their time selection.\r\n2. It reuses the design from existing Material Design components.\r\n3. It uses an established accessibility pattern (combobox + listbox) and it doesn't have the same concerns as the multi-column design around indicating the selected state.\r\n4. It allows us to support a wide range of locales.\r\n5. It's compact, allowing us to do some sort of unified control with `mat-datepicker` in the future.\r\n\r\nFixes #5648.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29806","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(material/timepicker): add timepicker component\" (#29806)"},{"Id":"2564990127","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-03T20:57:01","Actor":"DBowen33","Number":"29825","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slider): change color of inactive track","State":"open","Body":"change color and remove the opacity of inactive track to pass 3:1 non text color contrast ratio.\r\n\r\nhttps://screenshot.googleplex.com/9xZQAkEaEjY2Ad4\r\n\r\nBEFORE:\r\nforeground: #E1E3E13d\r\nbackground: #faf9fd\r\nratio: 1.04:1\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\nforeground: #74777f\r\nbackground: #faf9fd\r\nratio: 4.27:1\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a significant design change, so curious to see what y'all think of this\r\n\r\nfixes b/286300099","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29825","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/slider): change color of inactive track\" (#29825)"},{"Id":"2563833211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-03T18:01:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29820","RawContent":null,"Title":"Expose tokens to docs site","State":"closed","Body":"Adds some new functionality to the build that will extract information about tokens into JSON files so that it can be shown on the docs site.

In other words, there should be no difference in the final result compared to when `cdk/drag-drop` did not use popoper under the hood for the preview.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe element is centered vertically between top and bottom (if you do not consider the transform).\r\n\r\nThe combination of CSS below results in this particular issue (only properties included that really lead to this particular behavior):\r\n```css\r\nelement.style {\r\n    position: fixed !important;\r\n    top: 0px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.example-box {\r\n    align-self: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* user agent stylesheet */\r\n[popover] { \r\n    inset: 0px;\r\n}\r\n``` \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.0.0-next.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 19.0.0-next.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 11","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29809","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(cdk/drag-drop): Improper positioning of drag preview since it uses native popover (v17.3.6 and above)\" (#29809)"},{"Id":"2561042091","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-02T15:27:47","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29813","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(cdk/drag-drop): positioning thrown off with align-self","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes that the combination of setting `align-self: center` and the user agent styling of `inset: 0` on popovers was breaking the positioning of the preview.\r\n\r\nFixes #29809.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29813","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(cdk/drag-drop): positioning thrown off with align-self\" (#29813)"},{"Id":"2554734853","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-02T09:12:19","Actor":"yakovmeister","Number":"29801","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): remove duplicate condition for setting content","State":"closed","Body":"refactor(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): remove duplicate condition for setting content\r\n\r\nSeems like the condition for setting the `advancedMarker.content` is redundant here:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9011f50-afda-4569-8571-06ec49a6e12b)\r\nI think it's safe to remove the first condition.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29801","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(google-maps/map-advanced-marker): remove duplicate condition for setting content\" (#29801)"},{"Id":"2560285711","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T22:01:55","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29812","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(multiple): remove visually hidden styles from core","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29812","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(multiple): remove visually hidden styles from core\" (#29812)"},{"Id":"2559812472","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T17:28:28","Actor":"vejandla","Number":"29810","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-from-field): Remove the border for the input.","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n7.0\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nwith angular material 7.0, mat-form-field used to have `appearance=\"none\"` option, which would remove the border.

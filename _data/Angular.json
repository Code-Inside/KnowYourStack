Running `ng completion` now finds the relevant `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc. file and adds the command to load Angular autocompletion for you, so users don't have to understand how to do it. `ng completion script` prints the actual shell script which needs to be evaluated in the shell (previously this was done by `ng completion` directly).\r\n\r\nThis also includes a prompt which is displayed to users on first command execution. After set up or if the user refuses the prompt, the CLI stores this state in the global workspace configuration and avoids prompting again. Users are expected to use `ng completion` if they want to set up autocompletion after previously refusing the prompt. This hopefully provides a good middle ground where users who might not be aware of the feature can discover it without being too annoying to users who have custom shell setups or don't want autocompletion.\r\n\r\nThe prompt is also skipped when running on CI, in a non-interactive terminal, when running `ng completion` or `ng update` commands, or if a run configuration for the current shell already has `ng completion script` in it (implying the user already set this up).\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end tests cover most of the flows, though there are a couple error conditions which are impractical to test.

This greatly limits and even blocks some Angular applications.\r\n\r\nThere are timeswhen the actual index file of the app is hosted on a separate domain. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nGiven the following criteria: \r\n* The build Angular app's assets are uploaded to a **cdn**. \r\n  * Example: `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/build-123/<contents-of-the-dist-folder>`\r\n* The `index.html` file of the app is then **\"deployed\"** to a separate domain. \r\n  * Example: `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/build-123/index.html` is moved to `https://apps.mydomain.com/my-angular-app/index.html`\r\n\r\nThe combined use of `--deployUrl` and `--baseHref` gives Angular apps the ability to do this. \r\n\r\nHowever, this cannot be accomplished with _only using_ the `--baseHref` option. The two outcomes:\r\n1. if `index.html` uses `--baseHref` equal to the **cdn** (ie. `https://s3.cdn.com/my-angular-app/...`)\r\n    * assets are able to load\r\n    * route _throws an error_ and does not load the app (see error below)\r\n2. if `index.html` uses `--baseHref` equal to the **\"deployed\"** domain (ie. `https://apps.mydomain.com/my-angular-app/`)\r\n    * assets _cannot load_ because they are not uploaded to **deployed** domain\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI created a minimum reproduction repo. It has a detailed README with setup and testing instructions. It also adds a little more context and clarity around the difference between a **cdn** url and the **deployed** url. \r\n\r\n* https://github.com/djhouseknecht/angular-deploy-url-repro\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Unhandled Navigation Error: SecurityError: Failed to execute 'replaceState' on 'History': A history state object with URL 'http://localhost:8080/fake-cdn/#/' cannot be created in a document with origin 'http://localhost:4200' and URL 'http://localhost:4200/thor/'.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n> Error is taken from the mini repo above\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1300.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   13.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core            13.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      13.0.4\r\n@angular/cli                    13.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular             13.0.4\r\nrxjs                            7.4.0\r\ntypescript                      4.4.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nExtra relevant information in the minimum repo.

Without the option, all direct and transitive\r\ndependencies would have their scripts executed during the task's package manager installation operation.\r\nThe change only affects the package manager behavior controlled by the Schematics `NodePackageInstallTask`.\r\n\r\nFirst-party Angular schematics do not currently require any direct or transitive dependency\r\n`install`/`postinstall` scripts to execute. Only two dependencies within a v14.0 new project would\r\npotentially be affected by this: `nice-napi` (transitive from `piscina`) and `esbuild`. The `nice-napi`\r\nfunctionality of `piscina` is unused within the Angular CLI with no plans to use it in the future.\r\nEven if it was used, the `install` script runs `node-gyp-build` which would only have an effect\r\n(based on the current version 1.0.2) on platforms that are not Windows, darwin-x64, or linux-x64.\r\nIn the event this functionality is eventually used, the Angular CLI could be setup to automatically execute\r\nthis particular script for unsupported platforms. For `esbuild`, the `postinstall` functionality\r\nperforms an optional native binary bootstrap optimization but would only be performed if not\r\nusing Windows or Yarn. As such, it would not be performed for many users regardless of the change in\r\nthis commit. If noticeable performance regressions on platforms where the optimization was previously\r\nperformed are reported, the script could also be setup to be automatically run by the Angular CLI during\r\nproject creation and/or first build.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Schematics `NodePackageInstallTask` will not execute package scripts by default\r\nThe `NodePackageInstallTask` will now use the package manager's `--ignore-scripts` option by default.\r\nThe `--ignore-scripts` option will prevent package scripts from executing automatically during an install.\r\nIf a schematic installs packages that need their `install`/`postinstall` scripts to be executed, the\r\n`NodePackageInstallTask` now contains an `allowScripts` boolean option which can be enabled to provide the\r\nprevious behavior for that individual task. As with previous behavior, the `allowScripts` option will\r\nprevent the individual task's usage of the `--ignore-scripts` option but will not override the package\r\nmanager's existing configuration.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23059","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/schematics): disable package script execution by default in `NodePackageInstallTask`\" (#23059)"},{"Id":"1219449790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-28T23:34:54","Actor":"jbedard","Number":"23055","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update node to m1 compatible v16","State":"open","Body":"This sure would be nice :/\r\n\r\nnpm also updated to v7 due to: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3623 although that doesn't seem to fix it","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23055","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update node to m1 compatible v16\" (#23055)"},{"Id":"1219165441","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-28T19:17:07","Actor":"twerske","Number":"23054","RawContent":null,"Title":"schematic to add font inlining for a new font family","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 Feature request\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [x] add\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNew schematic to add the configurations to add a new font to font inlining so that if you have a theme with a new font, we can give the user a prompt like `ng add font-inlining --font=\"Google Sans\"` and add this to the app configs to inline their given font","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23054","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"schematic to add font inlining for a new font family\" (#23054)"},{"Id":"1219004337","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-28T17:34:16","Actor":"devversion","Number":"23053","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dev-infra to latest snapshot","State":"closed","Body":"Updates dev-infra to the latest snapshot, supporting for the\r\nnew migrate to main helper command.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23053","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update dev-infra to latest snapshot\" (#23053)"},{"Id":"1218530741","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-28T14:19:34","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"23051","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v2.1.9","State":"closed","Body":"[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action) | action | patch | `v2.1.8` -> `v2.1.9` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action</summary>\n\n### [`v2.1.9`](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.1.8...v2.1.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v2.1.8...v2.1.9)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[`v14.0.0-next.15`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1400-next15-2022-04-27)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/14.0.0-next.14...14.0.0-next.15)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### common\n\n-   Adds new required class member that any implementors of the LocationStrategy will need to satisfy.\n    Location does not depend on PlatformLocation anymore.\n\n##### router\n\n-   When a guard returns a `UrlTree`, the router would previously schedule\n    the

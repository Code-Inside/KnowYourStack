Libraries like Material come from npm and are published with `.metadata.json` files rather than codegen outputs (at least until a later point when the codegen is stable and we recommend that libraries publish it, maybe around v9)\r\n1. Bazel rules communicate symbol information with each other with `.ngsummary.json` files, partly to avoid cascading re-builds. They cannot do codegen for npm packages since that would mean two rules have conflicting outputs, or duplicate the code\r\n1. To bridge the two worlds, we run `ngc` as a postinstall step so that npm packages contain codegen before Bazel references them. This creates `ngsummary.json` files from `metadata.json` files, though @alxhub is surprised that it even works to do that.\r\n1. The translation of `.metadata.json` to `.ngsummary.json` files works okay for a leaf compilation.\r\n\r\nHowever, a downstream compilation will read from the intermediate `ngsummary.json` file and will produce undeclared symbols in the `.ngfactory.js` output.\r\n\r\nFor example, in angular-bazel-example\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-bazel-example/tree/c1f9819a9cc5f431a970a4ab6125860eef32b5a0\r\n\r\nIf we build `//src/material` we get\r\n\r\n`dist/bin/src/material/material.module.ngsummary.js`\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const i16 = require(\"@angular/material/toolbar\");\r\n...\r\n{ reference: i16.MatToolbar }, \r\n...\r\n```\r\nwhich is good, but the corresponding .json output doesn't propagate the module name:\r\n\r\n`dist/bin/src/material/material.module.ngsummary.json`\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"moduleName\": \"angular_bazel_example/src/material/material.module\",\r\n    \"symbols\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"__symbol\": 66,\r\n            \"name\": \"MatToolbar\",\r\n            \"filePath\": \"angular_bazel_example/external/npm/node_modules/@angular/material/toolbar/typings/index\",\r\n            \"moduleName\":\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that a downstream compilation unit like `//src` will produce\r\n`dist/bin/src/application.module.ngfactory.js` that references the `MatToolbar` symbol but never declares it, leading to runtime errors.\r\n\r\nHere's an analysis of how we get to that state:\r\n\r\nFirst, within the compiler, we don't find an import location for this. We try to write the import to the ngfactory here:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cfa6e8e008767387e366bf6a6baf6c1f2db9d122/packages/compiler/src/aot/compiler.ts#L255\r\nwhich calls to the `_fileNameToModuleName`\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cfa6e8e008767387e366bf6a6baf6c1f2db9d122/packages/compiler/src/aot/compiler.ts#L704\r\nbut the `importedFilePath` is not found in the summaryResolver's knownModuleName lookup table.\r\n\r\nThen we fall through to asking the host. Even if we strip off the `external/npm/node_modules`, the host cannot know the right import because the javascript file to load is in a different place from the files we read the summary data.\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n\r\n1. Why don't non-bazel users have this problem? They use the MetadataResolver which always gets the moduleName. The summaryResolver is used only under bazel/blaze\r\n1. Why don't blaze users have this problem? They build everything from source (as we've done under Bazel as well until recently) and so they only rely on summaries, not on metadata.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29454","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Not possible to generate a correct ngfactory import for an npm package using summary files\" (#29454)"},{"Id":"423975823","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T22:52:09","Actor":"devversion","Number":"29453","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ngtsc is unable to detect flat module entry-point on windows","State":"open","Body":"* See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29453","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): ngtsc is unable to detect flat module entry-point on windows\" (#29453)"},{"Id":"423893691","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T22:20:01","Actor":"devversion","Number":"29447","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: disable sauce-connect ssl bumping","State":"closed","Body":"By default we disable SSL bumping for all requests.

I've even logged `browser.baseUrl` and it's value is always `http://localhost:4200` no matter what value I define in protractor.conf.js\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.3\r\nNode: 8.10.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.2.3\r\n@angular/cdk                       7.3.0\r\n@angular/cli                       7.2.3\r\n@angular/flex-layout               7.0.0-beta.23\r\n@angular/material                  7.3.0\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   7.3.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.2.3\r\n@schematics/angular                7.2.3\r\n@schematics/update                 0.12.3\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.2.4\r\nwebpack                            4.28.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29445","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Protractor: Angular app uses hash routing. e2e tests do not navigate correctly.\" (#29445)"},{"Id":"423759692","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T16:36:44","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"29443","RawContent":null,"Title":"rollback pr #29375","State":"closed","Body":"It causes failing sharded tests to be reported as passing","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29443","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"rollback pr #29375\" (#29443)"},{"Id":"423741897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T16:23:36","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"29442","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: disable shard_count as it causes broken tests to pass","State":"closed","Body":"See discussion in slack #dev-infra","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29442","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: disable shard_count as it causes broken tests to pass\" (#29442)"},{"Id":"423533214","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T16:16:12","Actor":"alxhub","Number":"29436","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(compiler-cli): enable full TypeScript strictness","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29436","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build(compiler-cli): enable full TypeScript strictness\" (#29436)"},{"Id":"423721535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T14:06:37","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"29440","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(core): passing or failing?","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29440","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(core): passing or failing?\" (#29440)"},{"Id":"423725488","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T13:20:44","Actor":"rcketscientist","Number":"29441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Failed to find exported name of node","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/....\r\n\r\n`ivy-ngcc` throws this:\r\n`Failed to find exported name of node`\r\non an internal module that's not exported in a library.

Create a new project using `ng new`.  \r\n2. Create two components `ng g c app/components/home` `ng g c app/components/feature`.  \r\n3. Make a copy of app.module.ts file and name it app.module.prod.ts file.   \r\n4. Remove `import { FeatureComponent } from './app/components/feature/feature.component';` from app.module.prod.ts.  Reason is feature component is not needed in production.  \r\n5. Run `ng build --configuration=production`\r\n\r\nYou can clone the following repo and run `ng build --configuration=production`\r\nhttps://github.com/Jun711/replaceAppModule\r\n\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>/Users/j/Projects/replaceAppModule/src/app/app.component.ts is part of the declarations of 2 modules: AppModule in /Users/j/Projects/replaceAppModule/src/app/app.module.ts and AppModule in /Users/j/Projects/replaceAppModule/src/app/app.module.prod.ts!

In order to do this cleanly, and without namespace conflicts/races, we give each of these applications their own base-href, as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build\r\n    --configuration=staging\r\n    --output-path=./dist-e2e\r\n    --base-href=/ci-cd-draft-build-${JOB_NUMBER}/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is then uploaded to S3, and tested as follows:\r\n```\r\nng e2e --baseUrl=https://<s3-bucket>/ci-cd-draft-build-${JOB_NUMBER}/\r\n```\r\nWe also use these draft builds to perform Beta feature usability tests, product demos, and a variety of other activities that are greatly enhanced by having a fully functioning UI. Similarly, we publish whitelabel UI's for our customers, which we also run protractor-driven acceptance tests against, and whose base-url's vary greatly.\r\n\r\nJust now, I noticed this message:\r\n```\r\nOption \"baseUrl\" is deprecated: Use \"baseUrl\" in the Protractor config file instead.\r\n```\r\nWhich I traced to the following entry in the protractor schematic.\r\n```\r\n    \"baseUrl\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Base URL for protractor to connect to.\",\r\n      \"x-deprecated\": \"Use \\\"baseUrl\\\" in the Protractor config file instead.\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAs our `buildUrl` value is not known ahead of time, we cannot easily use the protractor config file; while we could attempt to inject it via some form of environment parameter, modifying environment parameters is more cumbersome than adding a commandline flag.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWe do not want this flag to be removed. It's not harming anyone, why is it being removed?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nWriting a configuration file for CI/CD, for every customer, environment, and build target we have.

I was able to pass extra args with 1.7.X builds but with new CLI versions I can't simply because CLI is very restrictive. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nDevelopers should be able to pass custom arguments to ng serve command. Classic example as follows. Our current project has so many API endpoints like DEV1, DEV2... SIT1, SIT2, SVP to PROD.

At one point, you may find that it is better for maintainability if each tab was its own component so you do not need to have one giant component with every piece of data that may show up across any of the tabs.\r\n\r\nThis is also better if, for example, each tab fetches data from a different source and you'd like to delay that network call until navigating to the tab (although [lazy-loading](https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/overview#lazy-loading) may handle that as well).\r\n\r\nAlso, in a lot of cases, it would be more ideal to be able to deep link into a given tab by using a `<router-outlet>`, which is why `mat-tab-nav-bar` seems like a good fit for something like this.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nA work around may be to build separate components, have those components be within each `<mat-tab>`, and then manually wire up the active tab state in the router via query string or route params. However, it looks like `mat-tab-nav-bar` was built specifically for this use-case, so it may be worth just baking the functionality into `mat-tab-nav-bar`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15570","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Tabs] Slide animation for mat-tab-nav-bar\" (#15570)"},{"Id":"423057807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T21:24:06","Actor":"suhailshaik777","Number":"15544","RawContent":null,"Title":"coloumn cannat be null error in angualr","State":"closed","Body":"#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nProviding a StackBlitz reproduction is the *best* way to share your issue. <br/>\r\nStackBlitz starter: https://goo.gl/wwnhMV<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15544","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"coloumn cannat be null error in angualr\" (#15544)"},{"Id":"423508982","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T20:51:22","Actor":"devversion","Number":"15557","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: serve ivy dev-app with lazy loading ","State":"closed","Body":"* Updates the Ivy script/build pipeline to support lazy-loading with the dev-app.\r\n* Removes duplicate lazy routes (otherwise causes error within rollup; to be in sync: #15558)\r\n* Ensures Ivy Angular install script ensures clean Ivy packages are installed\r\n* Ensures Ivy `build.sh` script works if Gulp is not installed globally.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15557","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: serve ivy dev-app with lazy loading \" (#15557)"},{"Id":"423928937","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T20:33:14","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"15568","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: don't format api golden files","State":"open","Body":"As discussed a while ago, we should be formatting the API golden files, because the task that checks them verifies that the files are exactly the same and the formatting throws it off.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15568","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: don't format api golden files\" (#15568)"},{"Id":"423918448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T20:06:46","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"15567","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(sidenav): some internal subjects not being completed","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a couple of internal subjects not being completed in MatDrawer and MatDrawerContainer.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15567","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(sidenav): some internal subjects not being completed\" (#15567)"},{"Id":"423911022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T19:47:04","Actor":"itslenny","Number":"15566","RawContent":null,"Title":"Click animations sometimes fire without firing click event","State":"open","Body":"\r\nOccasionally, I'll click a button, tab, etc and see the animation fire, but the click event doesn't fire.\r\n\r\nThis causes an obviously broken feeling experience.

Min-width is the current width, but should be expand if the text is greater. In most cases it's only a bit more pixels. About 4-5 characters? e.g. \"1000\" or \"0.1km\"\r\nBut the shape should not be stretched, because it looks ugly. A 3-patch (9-patch) object could help.\r\n- Allow custom shapes. And / or add the option to have a pretty rectangle shape.\r\n- ~~Adjust the font size.

My goal is to create a unit test using the Testbed provided by Angular Core.  I happen to be using Jest Test Runner (syntax similar to Jasmine) for my unit testing.  I am currently able to run tests without Testbed, by newing up the component.\r\n<br><br>\r\nExpected:<br>\r\nI expected that after the CLI generates a component and its associated unit test that the unit test would pass (see Component and Unit Test for the minimal reproducible example below).\r\n<br><br>\r\nActual:<br>\r\nIn actuality, I received two errors (see Errors below).  These errors show me that the component is not being instantiated in time for the test.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThings I have tried:<br>\r\nMy [previous question][1] shows a history of things I have tried thus far.  That start with the first thing I tried which was [adding the initiation of the test environment to the setup File][2]. This just resulted in `Can't resolve all parameters for ApplicationModule: (?).` You can go to that ticket if you are interested in the riveting discussion coming from that. On to this attempt...\r\n1. The second major attempt after the above leads to the below steps.  I tried wrapping the beforeEach Testbed call in an async function. <br>\r\n2. This simply results in the error `ProxyZoneSpec is needed for the async() test helper but could not be found.` After that, you add `import 'zone.js/dist/proxy.js';` to your setup file.<br>\r\n3. This results in the error `Expected to be running in 'ProxyZone', but it was not found.` After that, you find a few SO posts [one of which][3] suggests you use `fakeAsync` instead of `async` so you try that.  The error doesn't change this time. The test is still failing.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nThis post could have also been named:\r\n>Using Testbed to do Angular Unit testing - BeforeEach wrapped in Async causes the error: Expected to be running in 'ProxyZone', but it was not found. \r\n<br>\r\nBut I believe starting on solid ground with the MRE where the CLI leaves you is the best since that SHOULD work, but doesn't.\r\nAnyway, I am wondering where I went astray here.  If you have anything I could try I am all ears.  Thank you for your help.

The plugin is based on the design introduced by `tsc_wrapped` within Bazel’s `rules_typescript` and leverages the newly added ngtsc plugin from within the `@angular/compiler-cli` package.  By leveraging the same plugin interface that is used by Bazel, a common interface can be used to access the Angular compiler.  This has benefits to both major build systems and dramatically reduces the necessary code infrastructure to integrate the Angular compiler.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the plugin simplifies and reduces the amount of code within the plugin by leveraging newer TypeScript features and capabilities.  The need for the virtual filesystem has also been removed.  The file replacements capability was the primary driver for the previous need for the virtual filesystem.  File replacements are now implemented using a two-pronged approach.  The first, for TypeScript, is to hook TypeScript module resolution and adjust the resolved modules based on the configured file replacements.  This is similar in behavior to TypeScript path mapping.  The second, for Webpack, is the use of the `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` to facilitate bundling of the configured file replacements.  An advantage to this approach is that the build system (both TypeScript and Webpack) are now aware of the replacements and can operate without augmenting multiple aspects of system as was needed previously.\r\n\r\nThe plugin also introduces the use of TypeScript’s builder programs.  The current primary benefit is more accurate and simplified dependency discovery.  Further, they also provide for the potential future introduction of incremental build support and incremental type checking.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The deprecated string format for lazy routes is not supported by this plugin.  Dynamic imports are recommended for use with Ivy and are required when using the new plugin.\r\n\r\nPerformance and memory usage have also been improved with these changes.  Initial benchmarking indicates an average ~10% reduction in production build time and a similar ~10% reduction in peak memory usage.  The plugin is also not yet fully optimized.  The next phase of development will introduce performance tracing and support further improvements.  Watch mode is currently slower than the previous plugin and will be further optimized and improved once the performance tracing support is introduced.  Also, parallel type checking is currently not yet integrated which was a primary reason for the previous plugin’s watch mode performance.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17717","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Ivy-only Webpack ngtsc Plugin\" (#17717)"},{"Id":"617557035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-13T15:44:46","Actor":"alyahmedaly","Number":"17714","RawContent":null,"Title":"calling custom schematics that uses filter rule throws Error: A merge conflicted on path \"/angular.json\"","State":"open","Body":"We have a schematic which call's another 2 schematics using `externalSchematic` like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n    externalSchematic('@blabla/schematics-app', 'app', options),\r\n    externalSchematic('@blabla/schematics-widget', 'widget',options),\r\n```\r\n\r\nand both schematics app and widget updating same file, but the implementation of the widget one has\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { filter } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';\r\n...\r\nexport const widgetRule = (host)=>{return filter(path=>path !== \"blabla\")}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe problem is when schematics try to merge the tree back it has this condition\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/6e03adb9e2f161a9ba9f8826537bd13047981e79/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/tree/host-tree.ts#L166\r\n\r\nwhich check if the tree instance of HostTree and not consider FilteredHost tree\r\nnot sure the fix will to make filter return a Tree or to handle FilteredHost tree in this check\r\n\r\nhere is my versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.0\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: undefined\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics-cli    0.800.0\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.0\r\n@angular/compiler                 8.0.0\r\n@angular/compiler-cli             8.0.0\r\n@ngtools/json-schema              1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.0\r\n@schematics/schematics            0.800.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.0\r\nng-packagr                        5.2.0\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17714","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"calling custom schematics that uses filter rule throws Error: A merge conflicted on path \"/angular.json\"\" (#17714)"},{"Id":"617508896","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-13T15:23:07","Actor":"Heerschop","Number":"17713","RawContent":null,"Title":"Added buildOptimizer option for the ng serve command","State":"closed","Body":"Added the `--build-optimizer` option to the `ng serve` command. \r\n\r\nWith this change you can use `ng serve` in a production configuration without optimization enabled, which is a lot faster.

Have a look at the reproduction below. After you followed the steps, inside the `dist` folder, you can see that `my-lib` is not built for production anymore, even though I previously built the library for production. It seems that the command `ng build my-application --prod` changes the output of `my-lib`. If I build `my-application`, the output of `my-lib` should not be changed in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThis is annoying, because what I need to do to prevent errors in the build pipeline, is to\r\n\r\n1) build the library for production\r\n2) build the application for production\r\n3) build the library for production\r\n\r\nThe third step should not be necessary.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nCreate a workspace with a library and an application\r\n\r\n```\r\nng new my-workspace --create-application=false\r\ncd my-workspace\r\nng generate library my-lib\r\nng generate application my-application\r\n```\r\nNow build the library and the application with `production` configuration:\r\n```bash\r\nng build my-lib --prod\r\n# my-lib is now built for production\r\nng build my-application --prod\r\n# my-lib is not anymore built for production\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nBelow is the output in the console. As you can see, one step of the application build is `Compiling my-lib : es2015 as esm2015`\r\n<pre><code>> ng build my-lib --prod && ng build my-application --prod\r\n\r\nBuilding Angular

-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 8.x.x\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nConsider following situation:\r\n\r\n- there is an AngularJS application\r\n- follow [official upgrade guide](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade#upgrading-with-ngupgrade) to get it into hybrid mode with `ngUpgrade`\r\n- start writing all new components in new Angular (to not to add more legacy code) and where needed - use `downgradeComponent` to be able to use Angular components in AngularJS\r\n- if downgraded component is used _only_ in AngularJS templates - it will be shaken off the tree with production build - this manifests itself in component just not being rendered. Silently. No errors, warnings, or whatsoever.\r\n\r\n#### Workaround\r\n\r\nIt can be fixed with referencing the component somewhere, as suggested in related issues - https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35314#issuecomment-584821399, or in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16246#issuecomment-557051190\r\n\r\nFix commit: https://github.com/zuzusik/angular-upgrade-ivy-bug/commit/f123b6bcb680231f823d9260c29b9a79cd6d4c2f\r\n\r\n#### Things to fix/improve\r\n\r\nThere are several things about this which don't look right:\r\n\r\n- this is huge regression for applications using `ngUpgrade` - _ideally_ this should be fixed\r\n- it all happens silently - no errors/warnings/logs or whatsoever - _at least_ it should give some clues about it \r\n- it's discrepancy between prod and dev build - in dev build all still works great - _ideally_\r\n these 2 builds should not have such huge discrepancies\r\n- official upgrade guide says to include component into `entryComponents` which has no effect in Ivy - _at least_ it should have some notes about compatibility with Ivy and possible shake off of the downgraded components\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n* clone https://github.com/zuzusik/angular-upgrade-ivy-bug\r\n* run `ng serve`\r\n* observe all components rendered\r\n* run `ng serve --configuration=production`\r\n* observe `<downgraded-component>` not being rendered\r\n* expected - `<downgraded-component>` is rendered\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nNo exceptions or errors or whatsoever - and this is very frustrating.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.5\r\nNode: 12.16.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router, upgrade\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.5\r\n@angular/cli                      9.1.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.5\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

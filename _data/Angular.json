Please contact the administrator to restore access.`;\n    }\n\n    return $localize`Something went wrong`\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen I localize my application with `LoginService` implemented exactly like above, the strings in `_resolveEmailLoginErrorMessage` method aren't being picked up by the localization engine. **However**, when I move `_resolveEmailLoginErrorMessage` to a different file that will be imported by `LoginService`, then those strings will be added to the messages file as expected.\n\nIs there anything that I can do so that strings in a service are picked up by the localization engine?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nNone\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.4\nNode: 20.17.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 9.7.0\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.3\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... localize, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\n... platform-server, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.4\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.4\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.4\n@angular/cdk                    19.0.2\n@angular/cli                    19.0.4\n@angular/material               19.0.2\n@angular/ssr                    19.0.4\n@schematics/angular             19.0.4\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/60818","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"$localize does not pick up strings in services\" (#60818)"},{"Id":"2983994862","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-09T22:25:29","Actor":"egermano","Number":"60817","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: adds Azion deployment option to the CLI guide","State":"closed","Body":"Adds Azion as a deployment option to the CLI guide, providing users with another platform to deploy their Angular applications.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

automatic change detection or manual calls to `ApplicationRef.tick`.\n    Prior to this change, animations would not be flushed in some situations\n    if change detection did not run on any views attached to the\n    application. This change can affect tests which may rely on the old\n    behavior, often by making assertions on DOM elements that should have\n    been removed but weren't because DOM removal is delayed until animations\n    are flushed.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7a971766dc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7a971766dc59691dc68da9439e180a6c4d7b17d8) | feat | add extended diagnostic for uninvoked track function on `@for` blocks ([#&#8203;60495](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60495)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [8744c9a165](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8744c9a165518b77d2037d1255827836326dadf4) | fix | ensure HMR works with different output module type ([#&#8203;60797](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60797)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [4e88e18a8e](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/4e88e18a8ef0f19aed85316e80627ad6d2ec80a7) | feat | mark `toObservable` as stable ([#&#8203;60449](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60449)) |\n| [8d050b5bfc](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/8d050b5bfc49878f01777f71a37e34d5c1733b1b) | feat | stabilize linkedSignal API ([#&#8203;60741](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60741)) |\n| [866cea9a05](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/866cea9a057ac67fa3f679f1f3da18700926c15a) | feat | Stabilize PendingTasks Injectable ([#&#8203;60716](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/60716)) |\n| [39a4e00464](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/39a4e00464465b1e5a7f894d0992254d43f5028f) | fix | fix ng generate [@&#8203;angular/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/core):output-migration.

Replacement (HMR) Problems with Module \"NodeNext\"\n\nSetting `\"module\"` to `\"NodeNext\"` in `tsconfig.json` leads to errors during HMR, when changing the template or styles of a component.\nThis repository is showcasing this behaviour by providing two npm scripts `esnext` and `nodenext`.\n\nTo understand the problem further you can checkout following explanation:\n\n## Example\n\nTS:\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: `<div class='title'>{{title}}</div>`,\n  styles: '.title { font-size: xxx-large }',\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'hello world'\n}\n```\n\nRunning `npm run esnext` will start the dev server with `module` set to `Esnext` and `moduleResolution` set to `bundler`.\nWhen now for example changing `font-size` to `x-large` will trigger an update, the build will be rerun,\na network request to `http://localhost:4200/@ng/component?c=src%2Fcomponent.ts%40AppComponent&t=<timestamp` will be made,\nfollowing code will be loaded and thus replaces the component with the update correctly.\n\n```mjs\nexport default function AppComponent_UpdateMetadata(AppComponent, ɵɵnamespaces) {\n    const ɵhmr0 = ɵɵnamespaces[0];\n    AppComponent.ɵfac = function AppComponent_Factory(__ngFactoryType__) {\n        return new (__ngFactoryType__ || AppComponent)();\n    }\n    ;\n    AppComponent.ɵcmp = /*@__PURE__*/\n    ɵhmr0.ɵɵdefineComponent({\n        type: AppComponent,\n        selectors: [[\"app-root\"]],\n        decls: 2,\n        vars: 1,\n        consts: [[1, \"title\"]],\n        template: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {\n            if (rf & 1) {\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵelementStart(0, \"div\", 0);\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵtext(1);\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n            }\n            if (rf & 2) {\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵadvance();\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵtextInterpolate(ctx.title);\n            }\n        },\n        styles: [\"\\n\\n.title[_ngcontent-%COMP%] {\\n  font-size: x-large;\\n}\\n/*# sourceMappingURL=component.css.map */\"]\n    });\n    (() => {\n        (typeof ngDevMode === \"undefined\" || ngDevMode) && ɵhmr0.ɵsetClassDebugInfo(AppComponent, {\n            className: \"AppComponent\",\n            filePath: \"src/component.ts\",\n            lineNumber: 8\n        });\n    })();\n}\n```\n\nRunning `npm run nodenext` instead will start the dev server with module set to `NodeNext`.\nWhen doing the same change the network request will instead deliver following code:\n\n```cjs\n\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n    value: true\n});\nexports.default = AppComponent_UpdateMetadata;\nfunction AppComponent_UpdateMetadata(AppComponent, ɵɵnamespaces) {\n    const ɵhmr0 = ɵɵnamespaces[0];\n    AppComponent.ɵfac = function AppComponent_Factory(__ngFactoryType__) {\n        return new (__ngFactoryType__ || AppComponent)();\n    };\n    AppComponent.ɵcmp = /*@__PURE__*/\n    ɵhmr0.ɵɵdefineComponent({\n        type: AppComponent,\n        selectors: [[\"app-root\"]],\n        decls: 2,\n        vars: 1,\n        consts: [[1, \"title\"]],\n        template: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {\n            if (rf & 1) {\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵelementStart(0, \"div\", 0);\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵtext(1);\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n            }\n            if (rf & 2) {\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵadvance();\n                ɵhmr0.ɵɵtextInterpolate(ctx.title);\n            }\n        },\n        styles: [\"\\n\\n.title[_ngcontent-%COMP%] {\\n  font-size: x-large;\\n}\\n/*# sourceMappingURL=component.css.map */\"]\n    });\n    (() => {\n        (typeof ngDevMode === \"undefined\" || ngDevMode) &&

One requirement I got was to have the mobile design trigger whenever the Small breakpoint is triggered (not just at XSmall). However, when using the fixedTopGap like in the example given in the docs ([via Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fapp%2Fsidenav-responsive-example.ts)), I found out that the Toolbar switches its height from 64px to 56px when on XSmall.\n\nI'd like to add to the docs of the Toolbar at least some mention of the height-changing behavior. From what I can see, only the Toolbar (of all Angular Material components) has a behavior like this and is thus very different from what I was used to. The only mention of a separate mobile height is in the Styling part of the docs and it only mentions there is a value with that name and how to override it.\n\nAdditionally, I'd add something like the following to the docs of fixedTopGap in Sidenav: \n\"When used with Material Toolbar, the value set here should take into consideration the standard-height and mobile-height difference and when it's applied.\"\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/toolbar/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30829","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(COMPONENT): Toolbar doesn't mention responsiveness or how it works with Sidenav\" (#30829)"},{"Id":"2981100243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T22:48:25","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"30828","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/icon): mat-icon misaligned when text-spacing is applied","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30828","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/icon): mat-icon misaligned when text-spacing is applied\" (#30828)"},{"Id":"2977996944","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T20:14:36","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"30822","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: merge component token files","State":"closed","Body":"Reduces the number of token files so that each component has just one `m2` and one `m3` token file\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n- Removes support for \"ambiguous tokens\" in the overrides API.

After a lot of digging around I was actually able to get all the requirements for runtime translations running using all the things Angular offers. So it is really just the poor documentation that takes a lot of time on debugging and finding the right functions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest to add a section to the `Internationalization` guide under `Optional internationalization practices`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIn this guide I would cover the following things:\r\n\r\n1. Describe pros and cons of runtime translations (why would someone want that)\r\n2. Explain the necessary functions/variables (`loadTranslations`, `$localize.locale`, `registerLocaleData`, `LOCALE_ID`)\r\n3. Describe the required format of the JSON file for `loadTranslations` and potentially a script to parse `xliff` to `JSON`\r\n4. Show a minimal/simple setup for the `main.ts` and `app.module.ts` for the right initialization\r\n      1. Read locale from `LocalStorage`\r\n      2. Load the translation file using `fetch`\r\n      3. Call `loadTranslations` and init `$localize.locale`\r\n      5. Show how to lazy load only the required locale from `@angular/common/locales/` using webpack\r\n      6. Call `registerLocaleData`\r\n      7. Bootstrap app by dynamically importing `AppModule` **after** loading translations to also translate static variables (see [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46783#issuecomment-1183558559))\r\n      8. Set `LOCALE_ID` in `AppModule`\r\n4. Some further considerations\r\n\r\nI am happy to create a PR for this guide as soon as somebody from the Angular team gives me green light for it.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWe could also extends the documentations for `loadTranslation` and `registerLocaleData` but then the developers still need to find out that these functions even exist.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46851","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add doc section for runtime translations in internationalization guide\" (#46851)"},{"Id":"1306289333","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-15T17:06:43","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"46850","RawContent":null,"Title":"Usability improvement for previous versions on AIO","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you navigate to a previous version of a page using a version-specific URL like: https://v13.angular.io/guide/architecture, there is a banner at the top saying that:\r\n```\r\nThis is the archived documentation for Angular v13.\r\nPlease visit [angular.io](https://angular.io/) to see documentation for the current version of Angular.\r\n```\r\nThe link brings you to the homepage for the current version.

Since the switch however we only run this on the `main` branch because the previous branch filter `renovate/angular` doesn't match.\r\n    \r\nUnfortunately, we can no longer rely on the branch filter as for forked repos circle passes the branch names in the form of `pull/<number>`.\r\n    \r\nThus, we use orbs path-filtering together with circle ci dynamic configuration feature.\r\n    \r\nSee: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/path-filtering\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**ci: remove setup job**\r\n    \r\nWith this change we remove the `setup` job in favor of doing the setup in each step. This is faster because uploading and downloading the workspace archive on each run is time consuming.\r\n    \r\nOne of the main reason for this is `node_modules` directory, which is over 400mb in size.\r\n    \r\nWe save `node_modules` in the cache instead of yarn cache. This makes `yarn install` significantly faster in each job.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**ci: run `e2e-cli-ng-snapshots` in a separate workflow**\r\n    \r\nWith this change we fan out `e2e-cli-ng-snapshots` into a separate workflow to leverage circle ci conditional workflows feature https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043638052-Conditional-steps-in-jobs-and-conditional-workflows\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**ci: disable husky in CI**\r\n    \r\nHusky is not needed to be setup in CI runs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**ci: add all `node_modules` to cache**\r\n    \r\nThis is needed for noop future `yarn install` when cache is restored.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/23567","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"CI fixes and improvements\" (#23567)"},{"Id":"1305640895","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-15T06:39:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"23579","RawContent":null,"Title":"Circle config clean up","State":"open","Body":"See commits.

This is ultimately problematic for working in a Yarn pnp environment.  In fact, Angular Material's current `ng-add` logic adds one of their prebuilt styles to the `angular.json` using a relative path to `node_modules`, which is problematic on its own, but even if they adjusted it to be a package-relative path, it wouldn't work since their prebuilts are made accessible through package `exports`.\r\ne.g.:\r\n```json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n    \"@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\",\r\n    \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request is that module resolution for loading styles (and scripts) from the `angular.json` is expanded to support package `exports`, which would allow Angular Material to adjust their `ng-add` to use a package-relative path instead of a `node_modules` relative one.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nWithin a new project, run `ng add @angular/material`\r\nAfter completion, change the styles array in the `angular.json` to this:\r\n```json\r\n\"styles\": [\r\n    \"@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\",\r\n    \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\nRun `ng serve`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to use the above, you get this error on build/serve, since it's treating it as a file path:\r\n```\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat 'C:\\Users\\<user>\\Desktop\\test147\\@angular'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 14.0.5\r\nNode: 16.14.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.18\r\nOS: win32

Use mat-slider in template\r\n2. Scroll vertically into the mat-slider and interact with it. It can be hard to get the interaction with the vertical scroll so try a few different ways.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo \"[Intervention] Ignored attempt to cancel a touchstart event with cancelable=false, for example because scrolling is in progress and cannot be interrupted.\" in the console when interacting with the mat-slider control.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n\"[Intervention] Ignored attempt to cancel a touchstart event with cancelable=false, for example because scrolling is in progress and cannot be interrupted.\" repeatedly erroring in the console when interacting with the mat-slider control and slider doesn't move in deployed mobile device.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:v 14.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows, Android\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25272","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"fix(material/slider): avoid error on some touchstart events\" (#25272)"},{"Id":"1303478465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-13T14:50:52","Actor":"devversion","Number":"25271","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: improve logging for docs deployment targets","State":"closed","Body":"This makes it easier to spot where the docs deploy job deploys to.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25271","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: improve logging for docs deployment targets\" (#25271)"},{"Id":"1303415173","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-13T13:16:00","Actor":"devversion","Number":"25270","RawContent":null,"Title":"[14.1.x] build: fix missing sass import in `mdc-core/option/option.scss`","State":"closed","Body":"There were some imports removed accidentally due to us having\r\nto land changes in three branches.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25270","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[14.1.x] build: fix missing sass import in `mdc-core/option/option.scss`\" (#25270)"},{"Id":"1303303330","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-13T11:31:28","Actor":"Tomassito","Number":"25269","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(List): custom typography","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGiving list component as[ an example](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/3463c5a38cbbe187d022e3bfca075c93dcad2919/src/material/list/_list-theme.scss#L63) here. \r\nWhy does it have `subheading-2` defined as its font? \r\nNormally `subheading-2` corresponds to `h3` element which is bold (~700) and relatively big (~1.15 REM).\r\nThis is how it looks like when dev-tools-applied to 1. element:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37559178/178722495-da89c651-c887-488f-9d77-70e891b86cc4.png)\r\n\r\nThe problem is hidden until you want to provide your own typography definitions, because normally the theme sets the font to a fixed size of ~16px. However when we want our custom typography for the app, and define the `h3` (subheading-2) this is when it breaks. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

In order for an event to be successfully reported, the event must meet at least one of two criteria:\r\n1. The event explicitly contains context.reportLocation, or\r\n2. The event contains a message with a properly formatted stack trace.\r\n\r\nFor JavaScript, the endpoint expects the message to \"be the value of [error.stack](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Stack-Trace-API) as returned by V8.\"\r\n\r\nWhen sending the zone.js rewritten stack as the message for an event, stackdriver responds with:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"code\": 400,\r\n    \"message\": \"ReportedErrorEvent.context must contain a location unless `message` contain an exception or stacktrace.\",\r\n    \"status\": \"INVALID_ARGUMENT\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf instead I send error.originalStack as the message, the response is 200 and the event is reported.\r\n\r\nWhile there's no issue here that cannot be worked around, I think it's an unexpected gotcha that you cannot use error.stack in the message, particularly because this process of rewriting the stack isn't particularly easy to find in documentation.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nAvailable by request.

regression?\r\n@angular/cli<8.1.0 are good, so I think it is\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm using angular with laravel, so I can not directly use ng serve to test my site, but after I upgrade angular to 8.1.0, I found that `ng build --watch` can not work, before the upgrade, it's fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nsteps to reproduction:\r\n- cd `webroot folder`\r\n- ng new test-app\r\n- npm add -D holderjs\r\n- add `\"node_modules/holderjs/holder.min.js\"` to angular.json's `scripts` part\r\n- change `base` tag in `index.html` to something like `/test-app/dist/test-app/`, and it must be the correct folder\r\n- ng build --watch\r\n- open url like `https://localhost/test-app/dist/test-app` then, you will find that holderjs can not be loaded, because, there is no window object exists when running the `holder.min.js`\r\n\r\nbut if I use ng serve, then holderjs will NOT throw any error. this only happens when I'm using `--watch`\r\n\r\n## 🌍

All styles applied to the host are missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSimply create an Ivy enabled app with a SharedModule imported in the AppModule and set the components as described above.\r\n\r\nThen check the missing styles on the reloads.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n```bash\r\nAngular CLI: 8.1.1\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               8.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.801.1\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.35.2\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \":host CSS selector not working on live reload when Ivy enabled\" (#15101)"},{"Id":"468993390","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-17T06:03:46","Actor":"poojadutta","Number":"15099","RawContent":null,"Title":"dynamic switching of two styles.css files in one angular application","State":"closed","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n\r\ni am having two different angular applications, which i need to merge as a one major application.\r\nboth application has its own styles.css files, which after merging is getting distorted(css is going for whole application).\r\nIs there any way i can switch between these two style.css files dynamically?????\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/new/choose\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15099","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"dynamic switching of two styles.css files in one angular application\" (#15099)"},{"Id":"468757311","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T21:42:00","Actor":"clydin","Number":"15096","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: remove material-design-icons package as a development dependency","State":"closed","Body":"The package is quite large at 33MB (46MB on disk and ~90K files).  The large size can occasionally cause package installation issues.  The package is also only used in one test that is already covered by an E2E test.  The E2E test does not require the package to be present for development as the test installs it within a generated project during execution.  This also has the benefit of testing the icons package in a more real world use case; as well as allowing the test to serve as a guide for a user to add the package to their own application.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15096","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: remove material-design-icons package as a development dependency\" (#15096)"},{"Id":"468717668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T17:06:10","Actor":"fareshan","Number":"15094","RawContent":null,"Title":"mime types are not set with version 8","State":"closed","Body":"#14468 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [X] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nI had this issue after upgrading from angular 7 to 8\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn previous version, the generated JS files were indexed in index.html like this:\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"runtime.xxx.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nNow, I am getting it without the mime-types:\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"runtime.xxx.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is giving this error in the browser:\r\nMIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nng build --prod\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nMIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.1.1\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.1.1\r\n@angular/http                     7.2.15\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.801.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               8.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.801.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.35.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15094","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"mime types are not set with version 8\" (#15094)"},{"Id":"468467962","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T16:58:44","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15090","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): add commonjs module to universal tsconfig","State":"closed","Body":"The universal tsconfig extends the application tsconfig which by default it's module format is ES2015.

This feature would enhance the developer experience by providing:\n\n- A built-in ValidationErrorComponent that automatically displays validation messages based on the form's current state (e.g., touched, invalid).\n- Support for Localization, allowing error messages to be dynamically displayed in the user's preferred language using a LocalizationService.\n- Customizable error messages with options to tailor specific error message formats via a service like ValidationService.\n- Enhanced Error Handling: Developers can control whether to show a single error message or all errors for a form field.\n\nKey Features\n\n1. Reusable Validation Error Component\n- Provides a standalone, configurable component that can be used with any form control.\n- Automatically detects validation errors and retrieves corresponding messages from a service.\nLocalization Support\n\n2. Integrates with Angular's internationalization (i18n) capabilities to display error messages in the user's language.\n- Allows developers to specify custom error messages for each form field using a LocalizationService.\n- Error Message Customization\n\n3. Developers can define custom validation message handlers through a ValidationService.\n- Supports advanced configurations like minimum and maximum length, pattern, and required validators.\n\n4. Flexibility in Error Display\n- Option to display either a single validation error (e.g., for a cleaner UI) or all validation errors at once.\n- The singleError input allows switching between these two behaviors.\n\nAPI Design\n#### ValidationErrorComponent Inputs\n- field: The form control to validate.\n- label: The field label, displayed in the validation message.\n- constraints: Additional validation rules (e.g., minlength, maxlength) used for customizing error messages.\n- singleError: A boolean flag that determines if only the first error should be displayed.\n\n#### ValidationService\n- Provides error message handlers for common validation errors (e.g., required, minlength, maxlength, email).\n- Integrates with a LocalizationService to fetch localized error messages.\n\n#### LocalizationService\n- Loads localized messages for validation errors.\n- Provides an observable to determine whether localized messages are available.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```\nexport class BaseComponent {\n\n  protected control(name: string): AbstractControl | null | undefined {\n    return this.form?.get(name);\n  }\n}\n\nexport class SignInComponent extends BaseComponent {\n\n  public get signInForm(): FormGroup {\n    return this.form;\n  }\n\n  public get emailAddress(): AbstractControl | null | undefined {\n    return this.control('emailAddress');\n  }\n\n  public get password(): AbstractControl | null | undefined {\n    return this.control('password');\n  }\n\n  protected override initForm(): void {\n    this.form = this.formBuilder.group({\n      emailAddress: ['', [\n        required,\n        minLength(4),\n        maxLength(150),\n        email\n      ]],\n\n      password: ['', [\n        required,\n        minLength(8),\n        maxLength(24),\n        password()\n      ]],\n    });\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n    <form name=\"sign-in\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" [formGroup]=\"signInForm\" (ngSubmit)=\"signIn()\">\n\n      <div>\n        <label for=\"email_address\">Email Address*:</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"email_address\" id=\"email_address\" formControlName=\"emailAddress\"/>\n        <validation-error label=\"Email Address\" [field]=\"emailAddress\"></validation-error>\n      </div>\n\n      <div>\n        <label for=\"password\">Password*:</label>\n        <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" formControlName=\"password\"/>\n        <validation-error label=\"Password\" [field]=\"password\"></validation-error>\n      </div>\n\n      <button type=\"submit\">Sign In</button>\n    </form>\n```\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'validation-error',\n  standalone: true,\n  providers: [\n    ValidationService,\n    LocalizationService\n  ],\n  templateUrl: './validation-error.component.html',\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n})\nexport class ValidationErrorComponent {\n\n  protected readonly validationService: ValidationService;\n\n  public field: InputSignal<AbstractControl | null | undefined> = input.required({ alias: 'field' });\n  public constraints: InputSignal<AnyObject> = input({}, { alias: 'constraints' });\n\n  public label: InputSignal<string> = input('This field', { alias: 'label' });\n  public singleError: InputSignal<boolean> = input(false, { alias: 'single-error' });\n\n  /**\n   * Creates an instance of the class and initializes the validation service.\n   *\n   * @param {ValidationService} validationService - The service responsible for validation logic.\n   */\n  public constructor(validationService: ValidationService) {\n    this.validationService = validationService;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Retrieves all validation error messages for the current control.\n   *\n   * @returns {string[]} An array of validation error messages.\n   * If there are no errors, the array will be empty.\n   */\n  private getErrorMessages(): string[] {\n    const errors: string[] = [];\n    // Check if the control exists before attempting to gather error messages\n    if (this.controlExists) {\n      // Iterate over the control's error codes and collect their corresponding messages\n      this.controlErrorCodes.forEach((code: string): void => {\n        if (this.hasError(code)) {\n          // Add message for each error code\n          errors.push(this.getMessage(code).concat(' '));\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Return the collected error messages\n    return this.finalizeErrors(errors);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Finalizes the list of errors based on the singleError setting.\n   *\n   * If `singleError` is true and there is at least one error, only the first error\n   * is returned;

During template type checking, the compiler will verify that all required inputs have been specified and will raise a diagnostic if one or more are missing.

This is why there's a new check that enforces that all required inputs of a host directive are exposed on the host.\r\n* Required input diagnostics are reported through the `OutOfBandDiagnosticRecorder`, rather than generating a new structure in the TCB, because it allows us to provide a better error message.\r\n* Currently required inputs are only supported during AOT compilation, because knowing which bindings are present during JIT can be tricky and may lead to increased bundle sizes.\r\n\r\nFixes #37706.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49304","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(compiler): add support for compile-time required inputs\" (#49304)"},{"Id":"1607790898","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-03T01:25:33","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"49303","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): hydration logic for `<ng-container>`s","State":"open","Body":"**NOTE**: this PR is built on top of https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49285 and adds 1 more commit.\r\n\r\nThis commit incrementally builds on top of https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49285 and adds the logic to hydrate `<ng-container>`s and their contents.

In the MDC version (at version 15) of Angular Material, using `ng-container` within a button has an effect on the rendered DOM.\r\n\r\nThese expectations are based off of the Angular documentation, as well as my experience with previous versions of Angular Material. This issue was noticed while migrating an existing app to MDC.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Load this stackblitz in a Chromium based browser: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-1fvgpn?file=src%2Fapp%2Fbutton-overview-example.html,src%2Fapp%2Fbutton-overview-example.ts\r\n2. Observe the difference between the disabled button and the enabled button. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the disabled button (no `ng-container`) and the enabled button (with `ng-container`) to have the same visual appearance and the same DOM structure, since `ng-container` was used to host the `NgIf` directive.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nUsing `NgIf` on an `ng-container` that contains a `MatIcon` within a `MatButton` is effecting the rendered DOM structure. The disabled button's innerHTML has the `mat-icon` rendered as a direct child of the `button`. The enabled button renders the `mat-icon` within the `span.mdc-button__label` element, as a \"grandchild\" of the `button`.\r\n\r\nThis difference in DOM structure leads to an inconsistent visual appearance that is challenging for library consumers to style away. I believe this breaks the expectations of the `NgContainer` API.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: ~15.2\r\n- CDK/Material: ~15.2\r\n- Browser(s): Chromium\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26714","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-button): `ng-container` element is effecting the rendered DOM structure when used with `mat-icon` in `mat-button` template's innerHTML\" (#26714)"},{"Id":"1604164845","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-01T03:24:21","Actor":"pipeng119","Number":"26711","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): After the form control uses the required attribute, the error message cannot be merged with the custom validator attribute","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter using the required attribute in the form control, the object collecting error information will automatically be filled with a required attribute with a value of true, or if the custom form validator also returns the required attribute with a value of the other error information.

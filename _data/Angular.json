If you remove `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` from app component template and put `<app-counter></app-counter>`, everything works fine.\r\n\r\nProblem makes `ɵmarkDirty(this)` that is called immediately in `ngOnInit` method of counter component (see bellow **Workaround 1**). Then, when you click on increment or decrement button, `rootContext.flags` is equal to `1 (DetectChanges)` instead of `0 (Empty)`, and because of that, tick is never scheduled:\r\n\r\n![schedule-tick](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17877290/96188191-9bba5100-0f3e-11eb-8182-c98fad41333f.png)\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/markostanimirovic/zoneless-routing-bug repo\r\n2. Run `npm install`\r\n3. Run `npm start`\r\n4. Click on increment/decrement buttons, observe that count value is not changed\r\n5. Navigate to Counter 2, observe that count paragraph disappeared\r\n6. Navigate back to Counter, observe that count paragraph disappeared too\r\n\r\n**Workaround 1**\r\n\r\n1. Open `counter.component.ts` file\r\n2. Comment out lines 24-29\r\n3. Uncomment lines 32-38\r\n\r\n**Workaround 2**\r\n\r\n1. Open `app.component.ts` file\r\n2.

Lot of packages in  `package.json` got upgraded and 2 new packages got introduced : `@angular-devkit/build-angular` and `rxjs-compat` .

And nothing helped. I think it's not a duplicate. Because in short: I followed the recommended config (no ts-files in \"include\", entry \"files\" only). But this does not fully work and also disables intellisense. ...\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nI think this is since Angular 9, 10, 11.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI get some warnings about unused ts-files. Even if I remove all \"included\" of ts-files and only use entry \"files\".\r\nAnd over this, I need the includes for the autocompletion / auto-import suggestion / IntelliSense.\r\n\r\nWithout `**/*.ts` in `include` of `ts.config`, there are less warnings. But for some files like the prod.ts the problem persists.\r\nAnd without this include, I have no autocomplete anymore. This is no solution for me.\r\n\r\nWhat is this warning? What's the problem to have this \"unused\" files. Those files are included in the build?\r\nAnyway, I cannot remove all warnings about it and cannot use autocomplete if includes are not set. ...\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Build a monorepo (in my case).\r\n2. Call `ng build`.\r\n3. Get the warning/s about unused ts-files.\r\n4. Checkout the `tsconfig` files. Ensure the there is no `**/*.ts` as suggested. Use entry `files` only.\r\n5. Go to `apps\\demo-app\\src\\app\\pages\\dashboard\\dashboard.page.ts` and  test the autocompletion with `sayHello`.\r\n6. Find out that the autocompletion only works when `src/**/*.ts` and `../../shared/**/*.ts` are set in `tsconfig.app.ts`.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter if the include of ts-files is correct or not:\r\n1. You cannot remove all warnings with this suggestion config.\r\n2. You drop the autocompletion if you follow the suggestion.\r\n\r\n**[Download Demo-Project](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/5383307/test-demo.zip)**\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nWarning: ...\\test-demo\\apps\\demo-app\\src\\environments\\environment.prod.ts is part of the TypeScript compilation but it's unused.\r\nAdd only entry points to the 'files' or 'include' properties in your tsconfig.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThe file `environment.prod.ts` is not the only one in the warnings, on a more complex project.\r\n\r\n**tsconfig.json**\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"files\": [\"src/main.ts\", \"src/polyfills.ts\"],\r\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*d.ts\", \"../../shared/**/*d.ts\"],\r\n  \"exclude\": [\"src/**/*.spec.ts\", \"../../shared/**/*.spec.ts\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDown-side: No autocompletion.

([#&#8203;39207](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39207)) ([0875fd2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/0875fd2))\n-   **core:** depend on type definitions for Trusted Types

([#&#8203;38882](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/38882)) ([4a1c12c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4a1c12c))\n-   **language-service:** [Ivy] getSemanticDiagnostics for external templates ([#&#8203;39065](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39065)) ([63624a2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/63624a2))\n-   **language-service:** Add

**router:** add new initialNavigation options to replace legacy ([#&#8203;37480](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/37480)) ([c4becca](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/c4becca))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **router:** \\* The `initialNavigation` property for the options in\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` no longer supports `legacy_disabled`,\n    `legacy_enabled`, `true`, or `false` as valid values.\n    `legacy_enabled` (the old default) is instead `enabledNonBlocking`\n-   `enabled` is deprecated as a valid value for the\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` `initialNavigation` option. `enabledBlocking`\n    has been introduced to replace it\n-   **router:** preserveQueryParams has been removed, use\n    queryParamsHandling=\"preserve\" instead\n-   **router:**  If you were accessing the `RouterLink` values of `queryParams`,\n    `fragment` or `queryParamsHandling` you might need to relax the typing to also\n    accept `undefined` and `null`. ([#&#8203;39151](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/39151))\n-   **core:** \\* `ViewEncapsulation.Native` has been removed. Use `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom` instead. Existing\n    usages will be updated automatically by `ng update`.\n-   **compiler-cli:** Expressions within ICUs are now type-checked again, fixing a regression\n    in Ivy. This may cause compilation failures if errors are found in\n    expressions that appear within an ICU. Please correct these expressions\n    to resolve the type-check errors.\n\n#### 10.1.6 (2020-10-14)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **compiler:** incorrectly encapsulating

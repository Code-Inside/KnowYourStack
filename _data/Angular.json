These changes remove `getOwnedDirectives` and make it so in selectorless `getDirectivesOfNode` accepts the directive AST node itself.\r\n\r\nAnother goal of this refactor is that the TCB shouldn't have to check the `selectorlessEnabled` config option.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): allow binder to be created without matcher \r\nCurrently to create an `R3TargetBinder`, we have to pass some sort of directive matcher, however we also have a couple of use cases where we use the binder to do analysis that's unrelated to directives (e.g. resolving the `@defer` blocks). In these cases having to create a dummy matcher adds some slight overhead and makes the code harder to reason about since it looks like directive matching may be happening.\r\n\r\nThese changes update the `R3TargetBinder` to allow for `null` to be passed as the directive matcher.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): split up large method \r\nThe `ComponentHandler.resolve` method is ~500 lines and is a bit hard to follow due to some very long `if` statements.

I was getting errors with browserslist as they are using CommonJS requires in their code and my library and app were ESM. After removing [browserslist-useragent-regexp](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-useragent-regexp), simplifying my library to JS,  and still getting errors, they asked me to reach out to Angular as they were thinking Angular had an over complicated environment.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a shareable config following browserslist's instructions here: https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist?tab=readme-ov-file#shareable-configs\n\n\nHere is my particular example with text changed as it's for a client I'm working with:\n\n**Snippet of application's package.json:**\n\n```\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"extends @scope/browserslist-config-xxxx\"\n  ]\n```\n\n**Here is the library's code for this config:**\n\nindex.js\n\n```js\n\nconst BROWSERSLIST_QUERY = ['defaults'];\nexport default BROWSERSLIST_QUERY;\n\n```\n\nsnippet of package.json\n\n```\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"extends @scope/browserslist-config-xxxx\"\n  ]\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n[error] TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')\n    at find (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:12:25)\n    at matchBlock (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:46:10)\n    at /../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:73:17\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\n    at parse (/../node_modules/browserslist/parse.js:70:13)\n    at parseQueries (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:454:16)\n    at resolve (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:322:10)\n    at Function.select (/../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:1163:14)\n    at /../node_modules/browserslist/index.js:332:29\n    at Array.reduce (<anonymous>)\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 19.2.8\nNode: 22.14.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.2\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.2.7\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1902.8\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.2.8\n@angular-devkit/core            19.2.8\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.2.8\n@angular/cli                    19.2.8\n@schematics/angular             19.2.8\nrxjs                            7.8.2\ntypescript                      5.7.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30183","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Type error between Angular CLI and Browserslist when extending a browserslist config\" (#30183)"},{"Id":"3020455763","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T16:02:15","Actor":"Platonn","Number":"30180","RawContent":null,"Title":"In application builder allow for custom styles plugins, e.g. for SCSS paths mapping needed in monorepo with many libraries","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\n**Context - our usecase:**\nWere' developing a set of Angular libraries in a monorepo, where some libs can cross-import SCSS files from other libs, and they should @import them using \"symbolic\" library paths (not relative paths). e.g. in a SCSS file inside the lib A (`@my-org/*lib-A*/styles` ) we'd like to import SCSS from lib B (e.g. `@import '@my-org/*lib-B*/styles'` ).\n\n**Solution with old webpack builder:**\nWith the old Angular `browser` builder it was possible to apply SCSS paths mapping by applying a custom webpack plugin (e.g. using a 3rd party builder `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser` which extended the default Angular `browser` builder). See the example defining of paths mapping:\n* example nx `project.json` (but can be `angular.json` ) in our repo: https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/blob/30540a7957989c7ab520704bd2a09220454eaa15/projects/storefrontapp/project.json#L10-L14\n* example `extra-webpack.config.js` in our repo: https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/blob/30540a7957989c7ab520704bd2a09220454eaa15/extra-webpack.config.js#L24-L79\n\n**Problem after migrating to esbuild application builder:**\nAfter migrating to the new Angular `application` builder, which is based on esbuild, such a paths mapping no longer works (even when passing analogical custom plugin e.g. via the 3rd party `@angular-builders/custom-esbuild:application`). \n\nNote: we tried passing a custom plugin to [`buildApplication()`'s 3rd argument `extensions.codePlugins`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L152-L155), but it didn't affect the SCSS paths resolution.  Maybe we did something wrong. I guess it's becasue the styles plugins defined in the array below don't take the ambient `extensions.codePlugins` into account. See the source code of Angular CLI:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts#L61-L66\n\nNote 2: I understand that `buildApplication()` has a JSDoc comment [\"@experimental Direct usage of this function is considered experimental.\"](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/builders/application/index.ts#L145). That said, I'm still hoping we can help improve this function with our feedback, so it addresses needs of authors of custom Angular libraries developed in monorepos.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be nice to be able to inject into `buildApplication()` custom plugins affecting SCSS paths resolution e.g. into the [`plugins` array](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/936bda1b8db6165c4e45b5644a17b435f4739602/packages/angular/build/src/tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts#L61-L66) in `..../tools/esbuild/stylesheets/bundle-options.ts`.\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nWorkaround ideas:\nOur ultimate goal is to keep our example app in our monorepo working. And publish our libs so their consumers can import them and it should work in their apps.\n\nSo alternatively we can keep relative paths in our monorepo (e.g. `@import '*lib-b*/....' `. And as a post-build step of a production build of an Angular library (with ng-packgr) we could search-replace with a regex in the /dist folder all the cross-library scss import paths to relevant \"symbolic\" paths (.e.g `@import *@my-org/lib-b*/...`.\nThanks to this, the example app in our monorepo using relative paths would still work (no need for paths mapping in the `application` builder). And users of our libraries would get shipped SCSS sources which are cross-importing other libs' styles via symbolic paths, which will resolve successfully (using their `node_modules/*@my-org/lib-b*/...` )\nThe downside of it is that our example app in our monorepo would differ from our user's apps - which would be a bit confusing to read (and ambigious to diffrentiate it from non-cross-lib other relative imports from inside the same library itself).\n\nNote: I've found a related issue https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23552 but it's old and related to the webpack builder, where workaround with custom webpack plugin was possible. I've created this issue for the purpose of `application` builder, where I hope we could add an API for injecting a custom plugin affecting SCSS (e.g. for a custom paths mapping).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"In application builder allow for custom styles plugins, e.g. for SCSS paths mapping needed in monorepo with many libraries\" (#30180)"},{"Id":"3019153360","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T08:14:20","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30176","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): ensure `com.chrome.devtools.json` is consistently served after initial run","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nPreviously, `com.chrome.devtools.json` was generated and served correctly on the first run, but subsequent `ng serve` runs failed to serve the file unless the Angular cache was cleared.

This results in a disabled scrollbar being shown in the app.\n\nAs a workaround, apps in this situation should ensure that they remove content they want to hide & wait for that change to be rendered in the DOM before launching the dialog.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30943","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk/overlay): scroll blocking overlay persists when documentElement shrinks to the point it is not needed\" (#30943)"},{"Id":"3014712508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T18:17:29","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"30940","RawContent":null,"Title":"[PATCH] Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package","State":"closed","Body":"Note: this is the second attempt to merge this change, it now includes a fix for the documentation site which can be verified with the preview deployment.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30940","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[PATCH] Migrate to use rules_js based ng_package\" (#30940)"},{"Id":"3014717485","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T17:09:49","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30941","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.8\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30941","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.8\" with changelog.\" (#30941)"},{"Id":"3014682769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:55:28","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30939","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.11 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30939","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.11 release\" (#30939)"},{"Id":"3014678279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:51:41","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"30938","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.11\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30938","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.11\" with changelog.\" (#30938)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-04-29T03:30:02.58137Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1589}

This would allow teams to quickly recognize what improvements, what deprecations were made, as well as to which areas need more attention when conducting acceptance tests after an update.\r\n\r\nI think the following issues should be addressed to improve this experience:\r\n\r\n1. Format of the logs - these should be grouped by areas, aggregated (ie. without intermediate releases in between), no tables, pure text and github links. I am not sure using git commit messages for communication is a good solution - they may get too technical. Would be great if the most prominent features could be listed at the top.\r\n2. Missing minor and patch releases - update.angular.io has stopped listing minor/patch releases since v11. If you want to figure out a diff between `14.1.1` and `15.2.3` - you're out of luck.\r\n3.

I understand it is for performance improvement, But for already existing big enterprise-level applications, with many developers, it poses a big problem. Since many devs are working, an import-based circular dependency can be easily inserted in any part of the code, and with the useful 'circular dependency warnings' removed, there is no way to find such issues. And these issues may cause application to actually break in production. Which causes a huge impact on our reputation with the customer. We tried the alternatives suggested, but no luck\r\n\r\n1) Eslint -> import/no-cycle -> Makes our linter in CI run for more than 1.5 hours and finally breaks\r\n14:55:00  Linting \"@abcd/mnop-efgh\"...\r\n16:27:07  Cannot contact xyz-slave1: java.lang.InterruptedException\r\nThis is probably because our application is very big\r\n\r\n2) Madge -> Only found the type-based circular dependencies and no other circular dependencies... It is able to detect all circ-deps for a smaller application, But since our app is huge it is probably not able to find anything relevant.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n1) Keep the showCircularDependencies flag for development and not have it in production. In the angular.json we can have a warning, if showCircularDependencies is set to true, stating, \"Do not use in Production as it will slow the build\".\r\n\r\n2) Angular can have another script, which after running can let us know the circular dependency warnings. This script can be based on the build, used in Angular-13 or before... which finds circular dependencies. This script will be different from the build so no performance impact will be there.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nAs mentioned above eslint and madge were tried, but no value was added.

Within that components, I have a mat-select, which is not displaying any options, as the title mentioned. When I click on it, the select field itself is focused and gets the correct classes, but the options overlay is not appearing.\r\n\r\nMy guess is, that something is wrong with the handling of the overlay in combination with dynamically generated components. When checking the DOM, I could see that the overlay container was not added to the body. Outside of the dynamic component the exact same mat-select works as expected. I also tried to create a dialog within my dynamic component and it also works fine (overlay container is attached to the body).\r\n\r\nEvery other functionality within the component is working as well (root services, ngrx store, ...).\r\n\r\nThere are no console errors.\r\n\r\nModule imports contain MatSelectModule, MatInputModule & MatFormFieldModule.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or am I just missing something?\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. add mat-select to popupComponent:\r\n```\r\n<mat-form-field appearance=\"fill\">\r\n\t<mat-select multiple [formControl]=\"statusFormControl\">\r\n\t\t<mat-option *ngFor=\"let status of statuses\" [value]=\"status\">{{ status.id }}</mat-option>\r\n\t</mat-select>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Generate Component with createComponent(), using a generic EnvironmentInjector:\r\n\r\n`const popupComponent: ComponentRef<PopupComponent> = createComponent(PopupComponent, {\r\n\tenvironmentInjector: this._environmentInjector\r\n});`\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Add data to the component and execute change detection:\r\n\r\n`component.instance.statuses = statuses;\r\ncomponent.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges();`\r\n\r\n\r\n4. bind content to map popup (might be a possible source for the bug as well):\r\n\r\n`mapMarker.bindPopup(popupComponent.location.nativeElement as Content);`\r\n\r\n\r\n5. when opening the popup on the map and clicking on the select, the highlighting is correct, but nothing else happens:\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125544629/225877898-4a2c8117-ce56-41ac-9fc0-37570d2e91da.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nmat-options should show up\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmat-options notshowing up, overlay container not attached\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 15.0.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 15.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox 102.8\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-select): mat-options not showing up on dynamically generated component\" (#26803)"},{"Id":"1628386782","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-16T22:30:14","Actor":"zarend","Number":"26801","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(select, autocomplete): strong focus indicator not present for selected option","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFor options in a select or autocomplete, strong focus only appears on items that are *not* selected.

He/she can only figure this out by actually using the dialog and spotting that overlay classes are applied on the dialog that is opened.\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/cdk/dialog/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26791","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(CDK:Dialog): CDK dialog does not reference the prebuilt css it uses\" (#26791)"},{"Id":"1623928961","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-14T17:01:10","Actor":"leomayer","Number":"26790","RawContent":null,"Title":"Table matNoDataRow missing \"mdc-data-table__row\"","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n14\n\n### Description\n\nWhen the table row selector `matNoDataRow` is hit it doesn't include the class `mdc-data-table__row`. I guess that's the default class for a row!\r\n\r\nThe quite similar bug #26162 was reported as well - at least the start and the conclusion was the same!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/run?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftable-filtering-example.html\r\n1) Enter any kind of invalid data\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`matNoDataRow` should automatically inject class `mdc-data-table__row` \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n`matNoDataRow` is NOT inject class `mdc-data-table__row` .

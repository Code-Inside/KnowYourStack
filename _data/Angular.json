I believe this to be a bug since the various video tutorials I have followed did not show this behaviour.\r\nStopping the server and relaunching it solves the problem. But this obviously becomes tedious if it has to be repeated every time a new module is imported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create new project `ng new serve-import-bug` with default settings\r\n1. Launch the angular server with `ng serve`\r\n1. Add a new module in app.module.ts, for example `FormsModule`\r\n1. Look at terminal executing the `ng serve` command\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR in node_modules/@angular/forms/forms.d.ts:2553:22 - error NG6002: Appears in the NgModule.imports of AppModule, but could not be resolved to an NgModule class.\r\n\r\n    This likely means that the library (@angular/forms) which declares FormsModule has not been processed correctly by ngcc, or is not compatible with Angular Ivy.

Correct is `\"../dist\"` (two dots). Running `ng build` created a huge mess. In the app root a folder has been created with `...` as name (ending a folder name in Windows with a dot is illegal). Inside of this three dot folder all of my project files were listed (including `node_modules` folder). There was also a folder named `...`, which again contained my whole project files. This recursively went to whatever level (I clicked throuhg the folder approximately 30 levels down, there was still a `...` folder). Deleting the first `...` folder lastet more than 15 minutes, then telling me the files which should be deleted aren't there anymore. Also my project files in the root directory were deleted in this process (luckily most of it in Git). That was the strangest thing, it felt like the content inside of `...` mirrored my root project somehow (like in https://superuser.com/questions/528502/cant-remove-three-dots-folder-on-my-hdd). I also tried reverting my files using Git which did not work at all. I managed to delete the whole repository locally with `rm -rf 'folder'` using the GitBash. After cloning the project again, my IDE (Webstorm) listed the `...` folder once again, which luckily could be deleted this time. The project looks fine right now, and with the correct `outputPath` the app builds correctly.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the CLI checks pathnames for illegal characters. I did not try any other illegal characters inside of the path name.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCaution: Try in a sandbox environment with unimported files only to prevent loss of data!\r\n\r\n1. Change the `\"outputPath\"` in `angular.json` to `\".../dist\"` (three dots)\r\n2.

If we add a lazy loaded route, and in that NgModule we import `MatInputModule`, use MatInput in the lazy component and remove `MatListModule` from the main module, than the `@angular/forms` goes into the bundle of the lazy loaded module. Everything works great so far. Now, import `MatListModule` again in the main NgModule. The `@angular/forms` now goes to the main bundle.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/csbenjamin/issue-with-tree-shake\r\ncd issue-with-tree-shake\r\nnpm install\r\nng buil --prod\r\n```\r\nyou will see that `@angular/forms` goes to the main bundle, and it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.7\r\nNode: 14.8.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.7\r\n@angular/cdk                    10.2.7\r\n@angular/cli                    10.1.7\r\n@angular/material               10.2.7\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.7\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.7\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.5\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19527","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Javascript that should be in lazy loaded chunk is in the main chunk\" (#19527)"},{"Id":"754567738","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-02T07:11:06","Actor":"victorsc","Number":"19525","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support for WorkspaceProject and WorkspaceSchema interfaces","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 Feature request\r\nHello,\r\nStarting Angular 11, the experimental workspace API [has been removed](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/18642).\r\nOn our projects, we were relying on the `WorkspaceProject` and `WorkspaceSchema` interfaces for our internal builders and schematics.\r\n\r\nDo you have any recommendations of what we could use instead? \r\n[WorkspaceSchema](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/schematics/angular/utility/workspace-models.ts#L134) doesn't have all the missing properties the experimental API had.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nVictor \r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`) \r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/19525","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support for WorkspaceProject and WorkspaceSchema interfaces\" (#19525)"},{"Id":"754193686","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-01T09:06:39","Actor":"ikonezg","Number":"19523","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 11 update removes tsconfig.base.json","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] extract-i18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nAfter the update to Angular 11 tsconfig.base.json was deleted.

Using a mat-form-field with mat-chip-list and an input.\r\n2.  Declare the [matChipInputSeparatorKeyCodes]=\"separatorKeysCodes\", with separatorKeysCodes: number[] = [ENTER, COMMA, SEMICOLON, 188];\r\n3. Use a \";\" in the input to trigger the chipEnd event.

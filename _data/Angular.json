But in some cases, directive's input should not be an input on the component, but passing the value of the input is necessary. Value being either static or an expression.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Directive({\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n})\r\nclass MyDirective {\r\n  @Input()\r\n  directiveInput?: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  hostDirectives: [ MyDirective ],\r\n  host: {\r\n    '[directiveInput]': 'inputValue' // This won't work, even if `directiveInput` is defined in the inputs of host directive definition object.\r\n  }\r\n})\r\nclass MyComponent {\r\n\r\n  inputValue: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be a difference between using a directive in the view of the component, or on host, in terms of being able to declaratively bind to the directive inputs.\r\n\r\nRelated link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76662327/directive-input-binding-when-using-angular-hostdirectives\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAllow for binding to input values of host directives. \r\n\r\nA couple of not-thought-through suggestions off the top of mind:\r\n\r\n## Proposal 1:\r\n\r\nMake directive inputs available in host binding (either by [host](https://angular.io/api/core/Directive#host), or [HostBinding](https://angular.io/api/core/HostBinding)). Similar to the example above.\r\n\r\n## Proposal 2:\r\n\r\nIn `hostDirectives`'s `input`, allow for not only mapping directive inputs to component, but to bind as well:\r\n\r\nA couple of backward compatible APIs could be:\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  hostDirectives: { directive: MyDirective, inputs: ['directiveInput: \"inputValue\"'] } // Look at the quotes. If present, it defines an expression that should be bound to `directiveInput`\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  hostDirectives: { directive: MyDirective, inputs: [{input: 'directiveInput', value: 'inputValue'}] } // Look at the quotes. If present, it defines an expression that should be bound to `directiveInput`\r\n})\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nInject the directive, and assign the input manually in ngOnInit, and whenever it needs to be updated.

[`v3.3.0`](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/releases/tag/3.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.2.12...3.3.0)\n\n> **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/compare/3.2.12...3.3.0\n\n##### 🚀 Improvements\n\n**Method aliases**\n\nNew methods (`glob`, `globSync`, `globStream`) have been added in addition to the current methods (default import, `sync`, `stream`), which eliminate the need to rename the method when importing. In addition, an `async` alias has been added for the default import, which makes it possible to use this packet with ESM.\n\n**Method to convert paths to globs**\n\nA new method (`convertPathToPattern`) has been added in this release to convert a path to a pattern. The primary goal is to enable users to avoid processing Windows paths in each location where this package is used by utilities from third-party packages.\n\nSee more details in the [pull request](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/392).\n\n##### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n-   In the past, we mishandled patterns that contained slashes when the `baseNameMatch` option was enabled, which went against the documented behavior. ([#&#8203;312](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/312))\n-   Several problems with matching patterns that contain brace expansion have been resolved.  The primary issue solved is when the pattern has duplicate slashes after it is expanded ([#&#8203;394](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/394)), or the `micromatch` package does not correctly generate a regular expression ([#&#8203;365](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/365)).\n-   All negative patterns will now have the `dot` option enabled when matching paths. Previously, the `!**/*` patterns did not exclude hidden files (start with a dot). ([#&#8203;343](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/343))\n-   The issue that led to duplicates in the results when overlapping or duplicate patterns were present among the patterns has been fixed. At the moment, we are only talking about leading dot. Other cases are not included. For example, running with the patterns `['./file.md', 'file.md', '*']` will now only include `file.md` once in the results. ([#&#8203;190](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/190))\n\n##### 📖 Documentation\n\nA [clarifying note](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/blob/master/README.md#concurrency) has been added for the `concurrency` option, which provides more detailed information about the Thread Pool utilization.\n\n##### ⚙️ Infrastructure\n\n-   The benchmark in CI is now running on Node.js 20.\n-   The benchmark now uses the public package [bencho](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/bencho) instead of an in-house implementation. You may want to try this solution for your packages and provide feedback.\n\n##### 🥇 New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;josh-hemphill](https://togithub.com/josh-hemphill) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/383](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/383)\n-   [@&#8203;mairaw](https://togithub.com/mairaw) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/401](https://togithub.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/pull/401)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>TooTallNate/proxy-agents (https-proxy-agent)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.1`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/HEAD/packages/https-proxy-agent/CHANGELOG.md#701)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/compare/https-proxy-agent@7.0.0...https-proxy-agent@7.0.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   [`23fe1e3`](https://togithub.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/commit/23fe1e3): Correct the header parsing logic to stop before the response content to avoid generating an exception.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rich-harris/magic-string (magic-string)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.30.1`](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0301-2023-07-04)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/compare/v0.30.0...v0.30.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   expose .d.ts as cjs version ([#&#8203;253](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/issues/253)) ([262e113](https://togithub.com/rich-harris/magic-string/commit/262e113ee25e9c7d317282b3015102ec932ae2f5))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>puppeteer/puppeteer (puppeteer-core)</summary>\n\n### [`v20.8.1`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/tag/puppeteer-core-v20.8.1): puppeteer-core: v20.8.1\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/puppeteer-core-v20.8.0...puppeteer-core-v20.8.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   remove test metadata files ([#&#8203;10520](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10520)) ([cbf4f2a](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/cbf4f2a66912f24849ae8c88fc1423851dcc4aa7))\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n-   The following workspace dependencies were updated\n    -   dependencies\n        -   [@&#8203;puppeteer/browsers](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/browsers) bumped from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4\n\n### [`v20.8.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/tag/puppeteer-core-v20.8.0): puppeteer-core: v20.8.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/puppeteer-core-v20.7.4...puppeteer-core-v20.8.0)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **screenshot:** enable optimizeForSpeed ([#&#8203;10492](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10492)) ([87aaed4](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/87aaed4807e5240dec7b25273e44c1ce5e884336))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   add an internal page.locatorRace ([#&#8203;10512](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10512)) ([56a97dd](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/56a97dd2fb1cbf36e4f3344f7d22afd6e7ef2380))\n\n### [`v20.7.4`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/tag/puppeteer-core-v20.7.4): puppeteer-core: v20.7.4\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/puppeteer-core-v20.7.3...puppeteer-core-v20.7.4)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   fix escaping algo for P selectors ([#&#8203;10474](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10474)) ([84a956f](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/84a956f56ba9ce74e9dd0f95ff40fdd14be87b1d))\n-   fix the util import in Connection.ts ([#&#8203;10450](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/10450)) ([61f4525](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/61f4525ae306810404af9083d2e7440403c02722))\n\n##### Dependencies\n\n-   The following workspace dependencies were updated\n    -   dependencies\n        -   [@&#8203;puppeteer/browsers](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/browsers) bumped from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm on monday,before 04:00am on tuesday\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Since the erroneous styling is applied inline, this workaround also requires the use of !important tag, which is fine for now, but not suitable as a permanent solution. \r\n\r\nI'm also attaching the link to a sample github project that I used in the video recording, for more info on how the code is structured. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/swapnil-verma-gl/angular-material-tabs\r\n\r\nAddl note - While the project and the video use Angular Material v16, I can confirm that this issue is also present in at least angular v14, as that is what our actual project uses, and is where we first encountered this bug. \r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackblitz Link - https://stackblitz.com/edit/klkt9a-mfwvvv?file=package.json\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a component with a MatMenu and its trigger\r\n2. Inside the MatMenu, add a MatTabGroup, with a couple of tabs\r\n3. For each tab, add some content. This may be content directly inside the mat tab, or getting projected from another component\r\n4. Now, open the menu and switch between some tabs\r\n5. Close the menu\r\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 repeatedly. Eventually, you will reach a state where the content for the active tab is not being shown. Refer video recording for more details\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nContent for active tab is visible\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nContent for active tab is hidden.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14\r\n- CDK/Material: 14\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/27426","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(MatTabGroup): Visibility hidden mat-active-tab is not removed when MatTabGroup and MatTabs are used inside MatMenu\" (#27426)"},{"Id":"1799621132","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-11T19:25:16","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27434","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/schematics): support all potential default builders for ng add","State":"open","Body":"With the advent of the developer preview for the esbuild-based browser application builder, there are now three potential \"default\" builders that could be present: browser, browser-esbuild, and application.

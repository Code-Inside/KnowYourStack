The computed function generates a read-only signal, while linkedSignal produces a writable signal that can also reset based on changes in its source signals. When linkedSignal is used without specifying the `source `property, it appears to behave similarly to computed. This separation creates redundancy, as linkedSignal encompasses the capabilities of computed while offering additional features.\n\nAdopting a unified approach could provide Angular with a more streamlined and intuitive API for reactive state management, ultimately improving developer productivity and code maintainability.\n\nIf there are specific benefits that computed provides which linkedSignal cannot replicate, or other compelling reasons to maintain two separate APIs, I would greatly appreciate an explanation and your opinion. As it stands, having two such similar constructs feels like unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nTo streamline the API and reduce redundancy, I propose merging computed and linkedSignal into a single function, tentatively named linkedSignal. This unified function would accept an optional configuration parameter to specify its readonly mode. By default, it would create a writable signal, but developers could designate it as read-only through a .readonly() method, analogous to the existing input.required() API.\n\n`// Writable linked signal (default behavior)`\n`linkedSignal(() => {});`\n\n`// Read-only linked signal`\n`linkedSignal.readonly(() => {});`\n\nIn this example, linkedSignal creates a writable signal by default. When invoked with .readonly(), it produces a read-only signal, similar to the current computed function.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nInstead of:\n\n`linkedSignal.readonly(() => {}));`\n\nWe could use:\n`linkedSignal(() => {}, { readonly: true });`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59428","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: Unify computed and linkedSignal APIs in Angular with a readonly Option\" (#59428)"},{"Id":"2777819048","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-09T14:56:10","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"59450","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: clean up pipeline-specific tests","State":"closed","Body":"Now that we only have the template pipeline, we can remove the `.pipeline` extension from the files.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59450","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: clean up pipeline-specific tests\" (#59450)"},{"Id":"2778024846","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-09T14:42:51","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"59452","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(migrations): resolve text replacement issue","State":"open","Body":"Based on https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59353#issuecomment-2580320424, fixes a text replacement issue that seems to cause code to be duplicated in some setups.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59452","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(migrations): resolve text replacement issue\" (#59452)"},{"Id":"2775972281","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-09T14:21:10","Actor":"arturovt","Number":"59430","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(forms): drop `CALL_SET_DISABLED_STATE` name in production","State":"closed","Body":"In this commit, we drop the `CALL_SET_DISABLED_STATE` injection token name in production.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59430","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(forms): drop `CALL_SET_DISABLED_STATE` name in production\" (#59430)"},{"Id":"2777887480","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-09T13:45:46","Actor":"rubiesonthesky","Number":"59451","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs search doesn't find page by it's title (Migrations)","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nI want to see this Migrations page https://angular.dev/reference/migrations on another version but the website search does not find it.

So my set and delete functions used `signal.set(mutatedSignalValue)`, aka setting the signal to its own value, to trigger an artificial dirtiness flag.\nIt turns out an equality check occurs before the dirty flag is set (so it is not always set _**when**_ the set or update method is called), and since the map object was the same before and after, the change was not registered.\nI got away with it by implementing an equals function for maps, and passing it to the `signal` constructor, as documented. But my Maps are large, and that computation is costly, and since I take care of only `set`ting my signal when I really changed them, it would be more optimized if the dirtiness could be set strictly **_if and when_** I call the set or update methods.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSo what if I could just pass `() => false` to the `equals` of the signal constructor ? That way, the lengthy map equality computation would just never happen, and the computed signals would directly know they have to recompute whenever I choose to use the set or update method.\n(That could be offered a syntactic sugar as passing just false to `equals` instead of the arrow function above. It would disable equality checks altogether.)\nBut in order for any of these two to work, we need to know that the equality check (and more broadly the dirtiness flag being set) **_only_** happens **_if_** the set or update methods are called.\nI suppose it's the case, because otherwise if equality checks happen randomly I don't really see the point of having signals at all. But it would need to be set in stone, and documented.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59436","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Decide when equality checks and refreshs are executed on signals, and allow disabling equality checks altogether\" (#59436)"},{"Id":"2776043763","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-08T18:26:08","Actor":"thePunderWoman","Number":"59435","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update next branch to reflect new release-train \"v19.2.0-next.0\".","State":"closed","Body":"The previous \"next\" release-train has moved into the release-candidate phase.

There is no horizontal scrolling.\n\nInitial centering of the content is done with an effect in the constructor:\n\n```\nelement = viewChild.required<ElementRef>('my-scrollable-container');\n\n#scrollTo = computed(() => {\n  const nativeElement = this.element().nativeElement;\n  const scrollHeight: number = nativeElement.scrollHeight;\n  const offsetHeight: number = nativeElement.offsetHeight;\n\n  return 4 + (scrollHeight - offsetHeight) / 2;\n});\n\nconstructor() {\n  effect(() => \n    this.element().nativeElement.scrollTo(0, this.#scrollTo())\n  );\n}\n```\n\nMost of the time `scrollHeight` is 700px and `offsetHeight` is 300px and things work properly; however, about one in ten or fifteen refreshes (in Chrome) the `scrollHeight` and `offsetHeight` are the same, in this case 38px which cause the centering to fail.\n\nAs you might guess, hard-coding the scroll-to value does not fix the problem (and it would not be a viable solution, either).\n\nI'm guessing this is race-condition between the Chrome's layout calculation and the `scrollTo` signal calculation? Any ideas how to fix this calculation and/or behavior, without introducing a delay in the component constructor?\n\nA timeout will work-around the problem, e.g., with the following I didn't see a failed centering in fifty+ refreshes:\n\n```\nconstructor() {\n  effect(() => \n    setTimeout(() =>\n      this.element().nativeElement.scrollTo(0, this.#scrollTo()),\n      100\n    )\n  );\n}\n```\n\nA `afterRenderEffect` behaves better than a plain `effect` without `setTimeout` but still fails often; it is less reliable than a plain `effect` with a `setTimeout`:\n \n```\nconstructor() {\n  afterRenderEffect(() => \n    this.element().nativeElement.scrollTo(0, this.#scrollTo())\n  );\n}\n```\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/79337161/angular-viewchild-native-scrollable-css-window-layout-quirks\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-tz8xkcp1?file=src%2Fwindow.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nWhen `scrollTo` fails, I notice that the `div`s which make up the scroll-able component are not positioned correctly vertically -- there are wacky gaps between them, as if the final position has not yet been calculated by the browser.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.0.6\nNode: 20.18.1\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular:

This can potentially increase bundle size.\n\nConsider the following TypeScript class before build:\n```ts\nclass MyService  {\n    constructor(\n        private translationService: TranslationService, \n        private authService: AuthService) {\n    }\n\n    getActiveLang() {\n        return this.translationService.getActiveLang()\n    }\n\n    getUserMail() {\n        const user = this.authService.currentUser();\n        return user  ? user .email : null\n    }          \n}\n```\nAfter building, the JavaScript output looks like this:\n```js\nclass u {\n    constructor(_, t) {\n        this.translationService = _,\n        this.authService = t\n    }\n    getActiveLang() {\n        return this.translationService.getActiveLang()\n    }\n    getUserMail() {\n        const _ = this.authService.currentUser();\n        return _ ? _.email : null\n    }          \n}\n```\nThe private fields (`translationService` and `authService`) should be aggressively minified to improve bundle size. The expected output could be:\n```js\nclass u {\n    constructor(_, t) {\n        this._ = _,\n        this.t = t\n    }\n    getActiveLang() {\n        return this.t.getActiveLang()\n    }\n    getUserMail() {\n        const _ = this._.currentUser();\n        return _ ? _.email : null\n    }          \n}\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIntroduce a new configuration option in angularCompilerOptions to enable aggressive minification of private fields across Angular classes, such as:\n```json\n{\n  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\n    \"strictPrivate\": true,\n  }\n}\n```\nThis feature could be opt-in to ensure backward compatibility with existing projects, allowing developers to enable or disable aggressive minification as needed.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29285","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Optimize bundle size by minify private field\" (#29285)"},{"Id":"2775392124","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-08T13:38:31","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29283","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update `@angular/ng-dev` to support `rulesJsInteropMode`","State":"closed","Body":"The current version does not support `rulesJsInteropMode` which causes the build to fail.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/29283","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update `@angular/ng-dev` to support `rulesJsInteropMode`\" (#29283)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2778764193","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-09T21:14:34","Actor":"conalryan","Number":"30300","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(Table): Polling data causes memory leak","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nIf you poll for data then you will get Detached nodes each time the table refreshes.

in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using the Luxon date adapter, the first day of the week is always set to Sunday, regardless of the selected locale. However, in certain locales (e.g., French), the first day of the week should be Monday. This behavior can cause inconsistencies in applications relying on localized date formats.\n\nTo address this issue, we can provide custom options for the Luxon date adapter by using a factory function. This factory dynamically calculates the correct firstDayOfWeek based on the current locale, leveraging Luxon’s Info.getStartOfWeek method.\n\nHere's how to configure it:\n\n```ts\nimport { MAT_LUXON_DATE_ADAPTER_OPTIONS } from '@angular/material-luxon-adapter';\nimport { MAT_DATE_LOCALE } from '@angular/material/core';\nimport { Info } from 'luxon';\nimport { inject } from '@angular/core';\n\n{\n  provide: MAT_LUXON_DATE_ADAPTER_OPTIONS,\n  useFactory: () => {\n    const locale = inject<string>(MAT_DATE_LOCALE); // Retrieve the current locale\n    const firstDayOfWeek = Info.getStartOfWeek({ locale }); // Get the first day of the week for the locale\n    return { firstDayOfWeek };\n  },\n},\n```\n\nLuxon relies on the Intl.Locale.prototype.getWeekInfo API to determine the first day of the week. Unfortunately, this API is not supported in Firefox (as of now). However, Luxon includes a fallback mechanism that assumes Monday as the first day of the week, which aligns with the ISO standard.\n\nFor more details on getWeekInfo, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/getWeekInfo).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/gao3m1fm?file=src%2Fexample%2Fdatepicker-overview-example.ts,src%2Fmain.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open date picker and see that \"D\" (\"Dimanche\" aka. Sunday) is the first day of the week which is invalid as LOCAL_ID is \"fr\"\n2. Uncomment the last provider in `bootstrapApplication`\n3.

This enhances SEO capabilities by providing a simple flag-based approach to manage route indexability.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIn modern web applications, controlling which pages are indexed by search engines is crucial for SEO. With Angular's increased focus on Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and static site generation, applications now generate more content that search engines can discover and index. However, not all routes should be publicly indexed - admin panels, user dashboards, draft content, and sensitive pages need to be excluded from search engine crawling. The `nonIndex` property allows developers to specify whether a route should be indexed or not, providing a straightforward way to manage this aspect of routing without requiring complex meta tag manipulation or external SEO tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type Definitions\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport interface Route {\r\n  // ...existing properties...\r\n  \r\n  /**\r\n   * Defines a strategy for setting the non-index behavior of the route.\r\n   *\r\n   * When specified, the route will be marked as non-indexable for search engines.\r\n   * This can be used to control which pages should be indexed by search engines.\r\n   *\r\n   * @see {@link NonIndexStrategy}\r\n   *\r\n   * @usageNotes\r\n   *\r\n   * ### Simple Example\r\n   *\r\n   * ```\r\n   * const route: Route = {\r\n   *   path: 'admin',\r\n   *   component: AdminComponent,\r\n   *   nonIndex: true  // This page will not be indexed\r\n   * };\r\n   * ```\r\n   */\r\n  nonIndex?: boolean | Type<Resolve<boolean>> | ResolveFn<boolean>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n### Basic Usage\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'admin',\r\n    component: AdminComponent,\r\n    nonIndex: true  // Simple boolean flag\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'user-profile',\r\n    component: UserProfileComponent,\r\n    nonIndex: false  // Explicitly allow indexing\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Custom NonIndex Strategy Service\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class CustomNonIndexStrategy extends NonIndexStrategy {\r\n  updateNonIndex(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {\r\n    // Custom logic for determining indexability\r\n    const userRole = inject(AuthService).getCurrentUserRole();\r\n    const routeData = route.data;\r\n    \r\n    // Don't index admin routes for non-admin users\r\n    if (routeData['requiresAdmin'] && userRole !== 'admin') {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Don't index beta features\r\n    if (routeData['betaFeature'] && !inject(FeatureFlagService).isBetaEnabled()) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    return true;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using with Resolvers\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Using a resolver function\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'dynamic-page',\r\n    component: DynamicPageComponent,\r\n    nonIndex: () => inject(ConfigService).shouldExcludeFromIndex()\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\n// Using a resolver class\r\n@Injectable()\r\nclass IndexingResolver implements Resolve<boolean> {\r\n  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {\r\n    return route.params['sensitive'] === 'true';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'content/:sensitive',\r\n    component: ContentComponent,\r\n    nonIndex: IndexingResolver\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Conditional Indexing\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'article/:id',\r\n    component: ArticleComponent,\r\n    nonIndex: (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot) => {\r\n      const articleService = inject(ArticleService);\r\n      return articleService.isDraft(route.params['id']);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n### **Developer Experience**\r\n- **Simple API**: Just add `nonIndex: true` to any route\r\n- **Flexible**: Supports static boolean, resolver classes, and resolver functions\r\n- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions\r\n\r\n### **SEO Control**\r\n- **Granular control**: Set indexing behavior per route\r\n- **Dynamic decisions**: Use resolvers for runtime indexing decisions\r\n- **Search engine optimization**: Prevent sensitive or admin routes from being indexed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\n1. **Admin Routes**: Prevent administrative interfaces from being indexed\r\n2. **User-Specific Content**: Exclude personal dashboards and private pages\r\n3. **Draft Content**: Hide unpublished articles or preview pages\r\n4. **Sensitive Information**: Protect routes containing confidential data\r\n5. **Development Routes**: Exclude debug or testing routes in production\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nNone.

But since `signal` also has a way to hide the `WriteableSignal` behind a readonly interface (using `asReadOnly`) it would make sense imo to have a similar solution for `output`. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI don't have a finished proposal in terms of source code, since it is already very nice and clean to just specify an output with a single line of code and you would want to primarily specify the publicly visible (readonly) output that allows subscription including alias options etc. while also getting private access to the emit-method somehow as well. \n\nA theoretical way of course would be to handle this the same way signals do:\n\n```typescript\nprivate readonly valueEmitter = output<boolean>();\npublic readonly value = this.valueEmitter.asReadOnly();\n```\n\nBut since the output doesn't have any meaning without the component actually calling `emit` the final solution shouldn't rely on having to (always) specify the output twice. \n\nMaybe that is the reason why it hasn't been done in the first place and maybe it is too much to ask. But TypeScript never ceases to surprise me with crazy features that are unthinkable in other languages so maybe there is a way to do this in a \"clean\" and concise way. \n\nWhile we're at it: I think `signal` suffers from the same issue since in general you always want to hide the `WriteableSignal` which is easy to forget. The key difference is that you can actually do something about it thanks to `asReadOnly` and because the user has full control over the behavior. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62523","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"output should have a readonly interface\" (#62523)"},{"Id":"3212855850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-08T14:56:33","Actor":"angelaki","Number":"62522","RawContent":null,"Title":"Inputs as signals do not work when declared inside a generated class","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nJust found this discussion (https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/59152) what was _Closed as not planned_ so really sorry for trying it again!\n\nComing from the _old_ decorators I was always struggling with this issue but got the point, why it never was implemented.

The bundler uses a producer/consumer model internally, and the resource leak was caused by the consumer being termianted while there were still remaining unreceived results from a producer. To avoid the leak, the consumer now waits for all producers to finish before terminating.\n\n- Support empty `:is()` and `:where()` syntax in CSS ([#&#8203;4232](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4232))\n\n  Previously using these selectors with esbuild would generate a warning. That warning has been removed in this release for these cases.\n\n- Improve tree-shaking of `try` statements in dead code ([#&#8203;4224](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4224))\n\n  With this release, esbuild will now remove certain `try` statements if esbuild considers them to be within dead code (i.e. code that is known to not ever be evaluated). For example:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  return 'foo'\n  try { return 'bar' } catch {}\n\n  // Old output (with --minify)\n  return\"foo\";try{return\"bar\"}catch{}\n\n  // New output (with --minify)\n  return\"foo\";\n  ```\n\n- Consider negated bigints to have no side effects\n\n  While esbuild currently considers `1`, `-1`, and `1n` to all have no side effects, it didn't previously consider `-1n` to have no side effects. This is because esbuild does constant folding with numbers but not bigints. However, it meant that unused negative bigint constants were not tree-shaken. With this release, esbuild will now consider these expressions to also be side-effect free:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  let a = 1, b = -1, c = 1n, d = -1n\n\n  // Old output (with --bundle --minify)\n  (()=>{var n=-1n;})();\n\n  // New output (with --bundle --minify)\n  (()=>{})();\n  ```\n\n- Support a configurable delay in watch mode before rebuilding ([#&#8203;3476](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3476), [#&#8203;4178](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4178))\n\n  The `watch()` API now takes a `delay` option that lets you add a delay (in milliseconds) before rebuilding when a change is detected in watch mode. If you use a tool that regenerates multiple source files very slowly, this should make it more likely that esbuild's watch mode won't generate a broken intermediate build before the successful final build. This option is also available via the CLI using the `--watch-delay=` flag.\n\n  This should also help avoid confusion about the `watch()` API's options argument. It was previously empty to allow for future API expansion, which caused some people to think that the documentation was missing. It's no longer empty now that the `watch()` API has an option.\n\n- Allow mixed array for `entryPoints` API option ([#&#8203;4223](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4223))\n\n  The TypeScript type definitions now allow you to pass a mixed array of both string literals and object literals to the `entryPoints` API option, such as `['foo.js', { out: 'lib', in: 'bar.js' }]`. This was always possible to do in JavaScript but the TypeScript type definitions were previously too restrictive.\n\n- Update Go from 1.23.8 to 1.23.10 ([#&#8203;4204](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4204), [#&#8203;4207](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4207))\n\n  This should have no effect on existing code as this version change does not change Go's operating system support. It may remove certain false positive reports (specifically CVE-2025-4673 and CVE-2025-22874) from vulnerability scanners that only detect which version of the Go compiler esbuild uses.\n\n- Experimental support for esbuild on OpenHarmony ([#&#8203;4212](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4212))\n\n  With this release, esbuild now publishes the [`@esbuild/openharmony-arm64`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;esbuild/openharmony-arm64) npm package for [OpenHarmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenHarmony). It contains a WebAssembly binary instead of a native binary because Go doesn't currently support OpenHarmony. Node does support it, however, so in theory esbuild should now work on OpenHarmony through WebAssembly.\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;hqzing](https://redirect.github.com/hqzing).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

(esbuild)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.25.6`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0256)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.5...v0.25.6)\n\n- Fix a memory leak when `cancel()` is used on a build context ([#&#8203;4231](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4231))\n\n  Calling `rebuild()` followed by `cancel()` in rapid succession could previously leak memory. The bundler uses a producer/consumer model internally, and the resource leak was caused by the consumer being termianted while there were still remaining unreceived results from a producer. To avoid the leak, the consumer now waits for all producers to finish before terminating.\n\n- Support empty `:is()` and `:where()` syntax in CSS ([#&#8203;4232](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4232))\n\n  Previously using these selectors with esbuild would generate a warning. That warning has been removed in this release for these cases.\n\n- Improve tree-shaking of `try` statements in dead code ([#&#8203;4224](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4224))\n\n  With this release, esbuild will now remove certain `try` statements if esbuild considers them to be within dead code (i.e. code that is known to not ever be evaluated). For example:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  return 'foo'\n  try { return 'bar' } catch {}\n\n  // Old output (with --minify)\n  return\"foo\";try{return\"bar\"}catch{}\n\n  // New output (with --minify)\n  return\"foo\";\n  ```\n\n- Consider negated bigints to have no side effects\n\n  While esbuild currently considers `1`, `-1`, and `1n` to all have no side effects, it didn't previously consider `-1n` to have no side effects. This is because esbuild does constant folding with numbers but not bigints. However, it meant that unused negative bigint constants were not tree-shaken. With this release, esbuild will now consider these expressions to also be side-effect free:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  let a = 1, b = -1, c = 1n, d = -1n\n\n  // Old output (with --bundle --minify)\n  (()=>{var n=-1n;})();\n\n  // New output (with --bundle --minify)\n  (()=>{})();\n  ```\n\n- Support a configurable delay in watch mode before rebuilding ([#&#8203;3476](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3476), [#&#8203;4178](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4178))\n\n  The `watch()` API now takes a `delay` option that lets you add a delay (in milliseconds) before rebuilding when a change is detected in watch mode. If you use a tool that regenerates multiple source files very slowly, this should make it more likely that esbuild's watch mode won't generate a broken intermediate build before the successful final build. This option is also available via the CLI using the `--watch-delay=` flag.\n\n  This should also help avoid confusion about the `watch()` API's options argument. It was previously empty to allow for future API expansion, which caused some people to think that the documentation was missing. It's no longer empty now that the `watch()` API has an option.\n\n- Allow mixed array for `entryPoints` API option ([#&#8203;4223](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4223))\n\n  The TypeScript type definitions now allow you to pass a mixed array of both string literals and object literals to the `entryPoints` API option, such as `['foo.js', { out: 'lib', in: 'bar.js' }]`. This was always possible to do in JavaScript but the TypeScript type definitions were previously too restrictive.\n\n- Update Go from 1.23.8 to 1.23.10 ([#&#8203;4204](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4204), [#&#8203;4207](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4207))\n\n  This should have no effect on existing code as this version change does not change Go's operating system support. It may remove certain false positive reports (specifically CVE-2025-4673 and CVE-2025-22874) from vulnerability scanners that only detect which version of the Go compiler esbuild uses.\n\n- Experimental support for esbuild on OpenHarmony ([#&#8203;4212](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4212))\n\n  With this release, esbuild now publishes the [`@esbuild/openharmony-arm64`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;esbuild/openharmony-arm64) npm package for [OpenHarmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenHarmony). It contains a WebAssembly binary instead of a native binary because Go doesn't currently support OpenHarmony. Node does support it, however, so in theory esbuild should now work on OpenHarmony through WebAssembly.\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;hqzing](https://redirect.github.com/hqzing).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Looking into it, that `i18n` hash is the same for **all** the chunks (in any locale) across a build and appears to be a SHA256 of all the localized dictionaries.\n\nSince at least a couple of strings are going to change across builds (we have ~14k strings in the app), this effectively means that the entire app is cache-busted on each deploy, leading to increased infrastructure costs and degraded client-side performance.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nMinimal repro is available here: https://github.com/laurentgoudet/angular-i18n-esbuild-bug\n\nSteps I performed:\n- `ng new`\n- `ng add @angular/localize`\n- Configured an `fr` locale in `angular.json`\n- Added some string in `app.ts`\n- Ran `ng extract-i18n` to extract the dictionary\n- Copied `messages.xlf` to `src/locale/messages.fr.xlf` \n- Ran `ng build --localize` to run the localized build\n\n```\nng build --localize\nInitial chunk files   | Names         |  Raw size | Estimated transfer size\nmain-BGVPYDPI.js      | main          | 221.57 kB |                61.67 kB\npolyfills-25EJAOGH.js | polyfills     |  36.97 kB |                12.41 kB\nstyles-5INURTSO.css   | styles        |   0 bytes |                 0 bytes\n\n                      | Initial total | 258.54 kB |                74.08 kB\n\nApplication bundle generation complete.

Browser support, simplified dependencies!\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-browser-mapping/compare/v2.4.4...v2.5.0)\n\n#### ✨ What's new for users?\n\n- `baseline-browser-mapping` is now supported in browser contexts.  Frameworks that support module resolution will now load a single JS file of ~110kb (~22kb when compressed) and allows loading from CDNs like [jsdelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/baseline-browser-mapping) and [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/baseline-browser-mapping).\n- Adds support for CommonJS Node environments using the `/legacy` export path - no shimming required!\n- `baseline-browser-mapping` will now Issues a console warning if the current version of the module is >2 months old.\n\n#### ⚙️ Under the hood\n\n- Refactors methodology for including data from `web-features`, `@mdn/browser-compat-data` and `downstream-browsers.json`.  Instead of using direct dependencies, these modules are now pre-packaged into the exported script using daily GitHub Actions.\n- Jasmine test suite and other CLI tests now included to make it easier to contribute and prevent unintended regressions - all tests can be executed together using `npm run test`.\n- Simplifies GitHub actions and removes Dependabot - critical data updates to `web-feature` and `@mdn/browser-compat-data` are now part of the [`refresh_data.yml`](https://redirect.github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-browser-mapping/blob/main/.github/workflows/refresh_data.yml) action which only creates a new version of `baseline-browser-mapping` if the features or browsers information from the data provider modules has changed meaningfully.\n- Incoporates [@&#8203;notpushkin](https://redirect.github.com/notpushkin) 's simplified `compareVersions()` function from [https://github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-browser-mapping/pull/68](https://redirect.github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-browser-mapping/pull/68)\n- Updates `web-features` to 2.41.0 and `@mdn/browser-compat-data` to 6.0.29.\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n- [@&#8203;mrtnvh](https://redirect.github.com/mrtnvh) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-browser-mapping/pull/64](https://redirect.github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-browser-mapping/pull/64)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-browser-mapping/compare/v2.4.5...v2.5.0\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>danielroe/beasties (beasties)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.3.5`](https://redirect.github.com/danielroe/beasties/releases/tag/v0.3.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/danielroe/beasties/compare/v0.3.4...v0.3.5)\n\n#####    🐞 Bug Fixes\n\n- Write pruned css to disk when `pruneSource` is enabled  -  by [@&#8203;shishkin17](https://redirect.github.com/shishkin17) in [https://github.com/danielroe/beasties/issues/138](https://redirect.github.com/danielroe/beasties/issues/138) [<samp>(91453)</samp>](https://redirect.github.com/danielroe/beasties/commit/914536a)\n\n#####     [View changes on GitHub](https://redirect.github.com/danielroe/beasties/compare/v0.3.4...v0.3.5)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>evanw/esbuild (esbuild)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.25.6`](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0256)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.25.5...v0.25.6)\n\n- Fix a memory leak when `cancel()` is used on a build context ([#&#8203;4231](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4231))\n\n  Calling `rebuild()` followed by `cancel()` in rapid succession could previously leak memory. The bundler uses a producer/consumer model internally, and the resource leak was caused by the consumer being termianted while there were still remaining unreceived results from a producer. To avoid the leak, the consumer now waits for all producers to finish before terminating.\n\n- Support empty `:is()` and `:where()` syntax in CSS ([#&#8203;4232](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4232))\n\n  Previously using these selectors with esbuild would generate a warning. That warning has been removed in this release for these cases.\n\n- Improve tree-shaking of `try` statements in dead code ([#&#8203;4224](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4224))\n\n  With this release, esbuild will now remove certain `try` statements if esbuild considers them to be within dead code (i.e. code that is known to not ever be evaluated). For example:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  return 'foo'\n  try { return 'bar' } catch {}\n\n  // Old output (with --minify)\n  return\"foo\";try{return\"bar\"}catch{}\n\n  // New output (with --minify)\n  return\"foo\";\n  ```\n\n- Consider negated bigints to have no side effects\n\n  While esbuild currently considers `1`, `-1`, and `1n` to all have no side effects, it didn't previously consider `-1n` to have no side effects. This is because esbuild does constant folding with numbers but not bigints. However, it meant that unused negative bigint constants were not tree-shaken. With this release, esbuild will now consider these expressions to also be side-effect free:\n\n  ```js\n  // Original code\n  let a = 1, b = -1, c = 1n, d = -1n\n\n  // Old output (with --bundle --minify)\n  (()=>{var n=-1n;})();\n\n  // New output (with --bundle --minify)\n  (()=>{})();\n  ```\n\n- Support a configurable delay in watch mode before rebuilding ([#&#8203;3476](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3476), [#&#8203;4178](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4178))\n\n  The `watch()` API now takes a `delay` option that lets you add a delay (in milliseconds) before rebuilding when a change is detected in watch mode. If you use a tool that regenerates multiple source files very slowly, this should make it more likely that esbuild's watch mode won't generate a broken intermediate build before the successful final build. This option is also available via the CLI using the `--watch-delay=` flag.\n\n  This should also help avoid confusion about the `watch()` API's options argument. It was previously empty to allow for future API expansion, which caused some people to think that the documentation was missing. It's no longer empty now that the `watch()` API has an option.\n\n- Allow mixed array for `entryPoints` API option ([#&#8203;4223](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4223))\n\n  The TypeScript type definitions now allow you to pass a mixed array of both string literals and object literals to the `entryPoints` API option, such as `['foo.js', { out: 'lib', in: 'bar.js' }]`. This was always possible to do in JavaScript but the TypeScript type definitions were previously too restrictive.\n\n- Update Go from 1.23.8 to 1.23.10 ([#&#8203;4204](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4204), [#&#8203;4207](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4207))\n\n  This should have no effect on existing code as this version change does not change Go's operating system support. It may remove certain false positive reports (specifically CVE-2025-4673 and CVE-2025-22874) from vulnerability scanners that only detect which version of the Go compiler esbuild uses.\n\n- Experimental support for esbuild on OpenHarmony ([#&#8203;4212](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4212))\n\n  With this release, esbuild now publishes the [`@esbuild/openharmony-arm64`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;esbuild/openharmony-arm64) npm package for [OpenHarmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenHarmony). It contains a WebAssembly binary instead of a native binary because Go doesn't currently support OpenHarmony. Node does support it, however, so in theory esbuild should now work on OpenHarmony through WebAssembly.\n\n  This change was contributed by [@&#8203;hqzing](https://redirect.github.com/hqzing).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.0.3`](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/HEAD/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#small-703-2025-07-08-small)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v7.0.2...v7.0.3)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n- **client:** protect against window being defined but addEv undefined ([#&#8203;20359](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20359)) ([31d1467](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/31d1467cf0da1e1dca623e6df0d345b30fae0c3d))\n- **define:** replace optional values ([#&#8203;20338](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20338)) ([9465ae1](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/9465ae1378b456e08659a22286bee6bce8edeedc))\n- **deps:** update all non-major dependencies ([#&#8203;20366](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20366)) ([43ac73d](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/43ac73da27b3907c701e95e6a7d28fde659729ec))\n\n##### Miscellaneous Chores\n\n- **deps:** update dependency dotenv to v17 ([#&#8203;20325](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20325)) ([45040d4](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/45040d48076302eeb101f8d07bbcd04758fde8a4))\n- **deps:** update dependency rolldown to ^1.0.0-beta.24 ([#&#8203;20365](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20365)) ([5ab25e7](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/5ab25e73a2ea2a2e2c0469350288a183dfb57030))\n- use `n/prefer-node-protocol` rule ([#&#8203;20368](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20368)) ([38bb268](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/38bb268cde15541321f36016e77d61eecb707298))\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n- minor changes to reduce diff between normal Vite and rolldown-vite ([#&#8203;20354](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20354)) ([2e8050e](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/2e8050e4cd8835673baf07375b7db35128144222))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>colinhacks/zod (zod)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.25.76`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/releases/tag/v3.25.76)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/compare/v3.25.75...v3.25.76)\n\n#### Commits:\n\n- [`91c9ca6`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/commit/91c9ca6385bef38278605294498af06c89b9aa68) fix: cleanup \\_idmap of $ZodRegistry ([#&#8203;4837](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/4837))\n- [`9cce1c5`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/commit/9cce1c5779aea32d00226a931a7f67d3e2529d58) docs: fix typo in flattenError example on error-formatting page ([#&#8203;4819](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/4819)) ([#&#8203;4833](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/4833))\n- [`a3560ae`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/commit/a3560aeb6c3a8675a932601be79cfae897eec9d9) v3.25.76 ([#&#8203;4838](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/4838))\n- [`5060661`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/commit/50606616c0d291caf3210a7521da51271b918333) Release 3.25.76\n- [`7baee4e`](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/commit/7baee4e17f86f4017e09e12b0acdee36a5b1c087) Update index.mdx ([#&#8203;4831](https://redirect.github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/4831))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nWhen trying to integrate the `esbuild` based builder into Bazel with `rules_js` we found that it will incorrectly follow symlinks out of the sandbox. This is because Node.js based tooling runs in the output tree to support canonical JS project directory structures. The output tree will contain symlinks outside of the sandbox. Node tooling will generally follow these symlinks, which violates the rules of Bazel sandboxing. This can manifest in a wide variety of errors. One example we encountered with Angular compilation is that the symlinked browser entry point (e.g. `main.ts`) is outside of the range of `tsconfig.json` when the compiler follows the symlink.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nSetting the new `ENABLE_BAZEL_SANDBOX_PLUGIN` environment variable to `true` or `1` during a build with the `esbuild` based builder will now inject a special plugin to make `esbuild` compatible with Bazel builds in the output tree.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThe plugin itself was originally written in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_esbuild.

Currently, VoiceOver reads the selected date as “July 3rd, 2025, row X, column X,” but omits the associated day of the week.\n\nThis behavior does not meet [WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html), as the relationship between the date and its corresponding day of the week is not conveyed to assistive technologies.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n\n1. Enable VoiceOver via Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver\n2. Open Safari on an iOS device.\n3. Navigate to the Angular Material Datepicker demo page:https://material.angular.dev/components/datepicker/overview\n4. Open the datepicker by selecting any of the date input fields.\n5.

label-offset-x is incorrectly computed when there is a prefix","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nInside `_mdc-text-field-structure-overrides.scss`\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/7bb0a82a434c40d01a0d1aa35bcddaa3f725eccb/src/material/form-field/_mdc-text-field-structure-overrides.scss#L97\nWe can see that the variable `--mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x` is hardcoded to -16px (I guess it's coming from the fact that out of the box, form-field have a left-padding of 16px).\n\nBut for outlined form field, the left-padding could get bigger in some cases when using a large value for the border-radius.\n\nThis is because the left-padding is defined with `max(16px, var(--mdc-outlined-text-field-container-shape) + 4px)`\n\nSo if I want my outlined form-fields to be rounded like a pill, I have to override the border-radius with this\n```\n@include mat.form-field-overrides((\n  outlined-container-shape: 28px,\n))\n```\n\nWhich will set the left-padding to 32px and not 16px.\n\n\nAt this point everything looks good, and the label is correctly placed (when empty, it's aligned with the input value/placeholder)\n\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06337744-3a2c-407d-b4b4-7b6108a000c2\" />\n\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71516f3f-f5d8-46dd-86f0-45b050a672b0\" />\n\n\nBut things start to break when you add a prefix as it will `translateX` the label to make room for the prefix.\n\nThis transform is based on the hardcoded value of `--mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x: -16px;`, so it works great for out-of-the-box form-field, but doesn't work for my pill form-field.\n\nBecause the padding is set to 32px, the `--mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x` should be -32px and not -16px.\n\nSo I end up with this:\n\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573b3ef4-afd5-4d02-9394-d99bb8bcdae7\" />\n\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/550dca36-748b-43d0-904e-31a8a653cb19\" />\n\nAs you can see, the empty pill form-field's label isn't aligned anymore with where the input's value is.\n\nI know this can be fixed by overriding the `--mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x` myself by using `::ng-deep` to override the hardcoded value, but it's not something trivial to understand and fix, so I'd rather see a fix in the Angular Material repository.\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/tk7fhpq7-w7dz4vdj?file=src%2Fexample%2Fform-field.scss\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe label should be correctly placed when using a large border-radius value for outlined form-field, like the input value is.\n\nI believe the solution would be to change this line of code:\n```diff\n-    --mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x: -16px;\n+    --mat-mdc-form-field-label-offset-x: max(16px, var(--mdc-outlined-text-field-container-shape, var(--mat-sys-corner-extra-small)) + 4px) * -1;\n```\n\nBy the way, it would be nice to be able to control the \"minimum\" left & right padding to something else than the hardcoded 16px too 😅 \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe label is not correctly aligned.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.0.4\n- CDK/Material: 20.0.4\n- Browser(s): Chrome 137\n- Operating System:

You can't use `OverlayRef` as that will lead to the compiler error shown below. A workaround is to use `any` instead.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Set strict mode to `true` in tsconfig\r\n2. Try to implement `ScrollStrategy` using `OverlayRef`\r\n\r\n[Repro on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-d5ewhx?file=tsconfig.json,src%2Fapp%2Fcustom-strategy.ts)\r\n\r\n(On StackBlitz I noticed when opening the link I sometimes have to set strict to false then back to true for the problem to appear)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEither `OverlayReference` should be exported, or at least it should be compat with `OverlayRef` even in strict mode in `ScrollStrategy`.\r\nAlso it's a bit confusing when you look at the `attach` signature (or you run the \"Implement interface\" action) and you find `OverlayReference` which can't be imported. There's no easy way to tell you actually need to change it to `OverlayRef`. This should be somehow documented on the method.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWe get the following compiler error:\r\n```\r\nProperty 'attach' in type 'Some' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'ScrollStrategy'.\r\n  Type '(overlayRef: OverlayRef) => void' is not assignable to type '(overlayRef: OverlayReference) => void'.\r\n    Types of parameters 'overlayRef' and 'overlayRef' are incompatible.\r\n      Type 'OverlayReference' is missing the following properties from type 'OverlayRef': _portalOutlet, _host, _pane, _config, and 29 more.\r\n```\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 14.2.2\r\n- CDK/Material: 14.2.2\r\n- Browser(s): Irrelevant\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n\r\n`ng version`:\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 14.2.3\r\nNode: 18.4.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 8.12.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/25650","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(overlay): Compiler error using OverlayRef when implementing ScrollStrategy's attach method when in strict mode\" (#25650)"},{"Id":"1376705618","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-17T09:34:08","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"25649","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: switch remaining dev app demos to MDC","State":"closed","Body":"Switches all of the remaining demos of components that don't have MDC counterparts to use MDC components.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25649","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: switch remaining dev app demos to MDC\" (#25649)"},{"Id":"1376351269","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-16T18:52:45","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"25648","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: move datepicker to MDC-based button & form-field","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25648","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: move datepicker to MDC-based button & form-field\" (#25648)"},{"Id":"1373660779","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-16T15:43:52","Actor":"zarend","Number":"25643","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(slide-toggle): migrate examples to MDC","State":"closed","Body":"Migrate slide-toggle example to use mdc-based components.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/25643","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(slide-toggle): migrate examples to MDC\" (#25643)"},{"Id":"1375923699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-16T13:04:42","Actor":"djbanana1","Number":"25647","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(matExpansionPanel): mat-expansion-panel not collapsed on IOS v13.2.1 safari","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI opened an angular website that uses some mat-expansion-panels on an iPhone using IOS v13.2.1.

For example, I would like to make a chip that performs an action when clicked (e.g. increment a counter on click). I would expect this chip to be a native `<button/>` element or an element with `role=\"button\"`.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions Considered\r\n\r\n#### listbox\r\n`<mat-chip-listbox/>` is not an appropriate choice because it is for the ARIA listbox interaction pattern, which is not appropriate for chips that perform an action when clicked.\r\n\r\n### grid\r\n`<mat-chip-grid>` is also no an appropriate choice because it is part of chips that are a free form input.\r\n\r\n### `<mat-chip-set> and <mat-chip>`\r\n`<mat-chip-set> and <mat-chip>` allow the developer to set the aria role.

The Angular CLI will now attempt to use the `ParseForTypeErrors` value as well when available. Projects will need to use TypeScript 5.3+ for this option to be available. No behavior changes will occur on TypeScript 5.2 projects. This should not only provide a small improvement to build times but also a reduction in overall memory usage.\r\n\r\nBlocked on: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/53126","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26463","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(@angular-devkit/build-angular): reduce TypeScript JSDoc parsing in application builder\" (#26463)"},{"Id":"2005947864","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-22T17:12:32","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"26458","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): treeshake unused class that use custom decorators","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\nThis changes enables wrapping classes in side-effect free modules that make use of custom decorators when using the esbuild based builders so that when such classes are unused they can be treeshaken.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26458","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): treeshake unused class that use custom decorators\" (#26458)"},{"Id":"2006113427","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-22T17:07:56","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"26461","RawContent":null,"Title":"application builder: JSON import regression with dashed root keys","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild, serve\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nWhen importing a json file using `import('file.json')` in an CLi application, the JSON returned does not include the root keys that have a dash in their name.\r\n\r\nConsider the following JSON:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"withoutdash\": \"Without dash, OK\",\r\n  \"with-dash\": \"With dash, OK\",\r\n  \"nested\": {\r\n    \"withoutdash\": \"Nested without dash, OK\",\r\n    \"with-dash\": \"Nested with dash, OK\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nloaded in a component dynamically:\r\n```ts\r\n  jsonContent: any;\r\n\r\n  async show() {\r\n    const fileName = 'test';\r\n    this.jsonContent = await import(`./${fileName}.json`);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then displayed:\r\n```html\r\n<button (click)=\"show()\">Load and show JSON content</button>\r\n\r\n@if (jsonContent) {\r\n<h1>Whole object</h1>\r\n<pre>{{ jsonContent | json }}</pre>\r\n\r\n<h1>Default property</h1>\r\n<pre>{{ jsonContent.default | json }}</pre>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe whole object displays (no `with-dash` root key):\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"default\": {\r\n    \"withoutdash\": \"Without dash, OK\",\r\n    \"with-dash\": \"With dash, OK\",\r\n    \"nested\": {\r\n      \"withoutdash\": \"Nested without dash, OK\",\r\n      \"with-dash\": \"Nested with dash, OK\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"nested\": {\r\n    \"withoutdash\": \"Nested without dash, OK\",\r\n    \"with-dash\": \"Nested with dash, OK\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"withoutdash\": \"Without dash, OK\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas the default content is correct:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"withoutdash\": \"Without dash, OK\",\r\n  \"with-dash\": \"With dash, OK\",\r\n  \"nested\": {\r\n    \"withoutdash\": \"Nested without dash, OK\",\r\n    \"with-dash\": \"Nested with dash, OK\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-dg68rk?file=json-loading-bug%2Fsrc%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\nRun:\r\n```\r\ncd json-loading-bug/\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm run start\r\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 17.0.3\r\nNode: 18.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.4.2\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.0.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1700.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.0.3\r\n@angular/cli                    17.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular             17.0.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.2.2\r\nzone.js                         0.14.2\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\nA workaround is to use the default property:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nthis.jsonContent = await import(`./${fileName}.json`).then(m => m.default);\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26461","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"application builder: JSON import regression with dashed root keys\" (#26461)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2010530472","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-25T08:33:00","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28187","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: custom lint rules not working locally","State":"open","Body":"We have some custom lint rules that only apply to specific files.

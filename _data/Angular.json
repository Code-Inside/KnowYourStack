It's a no-op because it happens after Jasmine has already constructed its `GlobalErrors` instance. If the monkey-patching occurred early enough to have any effect, it would crash Jasmine beginning with the next jasmine-core release because [GlobalErrors has required constructor parameters](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/42cca93926638d3660efc356b14d3ca3d531e09d/src/core/GlobalErrors.js#L10C25-L10C34) and [zone.js's monkey patch fails to forward them](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/660444fbf296ce45f0a33d443e804237fa9bb8cc/packages/zone.js/lib/jasmine/jasmine.ts#L65)\n\nMy recommendation is to stop monkey patching `GlobalErrors` altogether. Presumably it's not doing anything important, if nobody noticed that it wasn't working. And any monkey patching creates a situation where any future version of jasmine-core could be incompatible, since you're depending on private interfaces that are outside of the scope of semver. So the less of it you can do, the better. But if you have to monkey patch `GlobalErrors`, it would be best to forward all constructor arguments to the real thing.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63072","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"zone.js monkey patching of Jasmine's GlobalErrors is a no-op, and would break Jasmine if it wasn't\" (#63072)"},{"Id":"3307620657","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-11T23:41:17","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"63077","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(zone.js): remove unused jasmine globalerror monkey patch.","State":"closed","Body":"This is for testing purposes for now.

The exact version (and checksum) is saved in the lockfile.\n  3. Scripts use the local runtime, ensuring consistency across environments.\n\n  Why this is better:\n\n  1. This new setting supports also Deno and Bun (vs. our Node-only settings `useNodeVersion` and `executionEnv.nodeVersion`)\n  2. Supports version ranges (not just a fixed version).\n  3. The resolved version is stored in the pnpm lockfile, along with an integrity checksum for future validation of the Node.js content's validity.\n  4. It can be used on any workspace project (like `executionEnv.nodeVersion`). So, different projects in a workspace can use different runtimes.\n  5. For now `devEngines.runtime` setting will install the runtime locally, which we will improve in future versions of pnpm by using a shared location on the computer.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;9755](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9755).\n\n- Add `--cpu`, `--libc`, and `--os` to `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, and `pnpm dlx` to customize `supportedArchitectures` via the CLI [#&#8203;7510](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/7510).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix a bug in which `pnpm add` downloads packages whose `libc` differ from `pnpm.supportedArchitectures.libc`.\n- The integrities of the downloaded Node.js artifacts are verified [#&#8203;9750](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9750).\n- Allow `dlx` to parse CLI flags and options between the `dlx` command and the command to run or between the `dlx` command and `--` [#&#8203;9719](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9719).\n- `pnpm install --prod` should removing hoisted dev dependencies [#&#8203;9782](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9782).\n- Fix an edge case bug causing local tarballs to not re-link into the virtual store.

When enabled, `node_modules` contains only symlinks to a central virtual store, rather to `node_modules/.pnpm`. By default, this central store is located at `<store-path>/links` (you can find the store path by running `pnpm store path`).\n\n  In the central virtual store, each package is hard linked into a directory whose name is the hash of its dependency graph. This allows multiple projects on the system to symlink shared dependencies from this central location, significantly improving installation speed when a warm cache is available.\n\n  > This is conceptually similar to how [NixOS manages packages](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works/), using dependency graph hashes to create isolated and reusable package directories.\n\n  To enable the global virtual store, set `enableGlobalVirtualStore: true` in your root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, or globally via:\n\n  ```sh\n  pnpm config -g set enable-global-virtual-store true\n  ```\n\n  NOTE: In CI environments, where caches are typically cold, this setting may slow down installation. pnpm automatically disables the global virtual store when running in CI.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;8190](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8190)\n\n* The `pnpm update` command now supports updating `catalog:` protocol dependencies and writes new specifiers to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.\n* Added two new CLI options (`--save-catalog` and `--save-catalog-name=<name>`) to `pnpm add` to save new dependencies as catalog entries. `catalog:` or `catalog:<name>` will be added to `package.json` and the package specifier will be added to the `catalogs` or `catalog[<name>]` object in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` [#&#8203;9425](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9425).\n* **Semi-breaking.** The keys used for side-effects caches have changed. If you have a side-effects cache generated by a previous version of pnpm, the new version will not use it and will create a new cache instead [#&#8203;9605](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9605).\n* Added a new setting called `ci` for explicitly telling pnpm if the current environment is a CI or not.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Sort versions printed by `pnpm patch` using semantic versioning rules.\n- Improve the way the error message displays mismatched specifiers. Show differences instead of 2 whole objects [#&#8203;9598](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9598).\n- Revert [#&#8203;9574](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9574) to fix a regression [#&#8203;9596](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9596).\n\n### [`v10.11.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10111)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.11.0...v10.11.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix an issue in which `pnpm deploy --legacy` creates unexpected directories when the root `package.json` has a workspace package as a peer dependency [#&#8203;9550](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9550).\n- Dependencies specified via a URL that redirects will only be locked to the target if it is immutable, fixing a regression when installing from GitHub releases.

Fixes a regression shipped in pnpm v10.11 via [#&#8203;9502](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9502).\n- `pnpm -r --silent run` should not print out section [#&#8203;9563](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9563).\n\n### [`v10.11.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10110)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.10.0...v10.11.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- A new setting added for `pnpm init` to create a `package.json` with `type=module`, when `init-type` is `module`. Works as a flag for the init command too [#&#8203;9463](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9463).\n\n- Added support for Nushell to `pnpm setup` [#&#8203;6476](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/6476).\n\n- Added two new flags to the `pnpm audit` command, `--ignore` and `--ignore-unfixable` [#&#8203;8474](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8474).\n\n  Ignore all vulnerabilities that have no solution:\n\n  ```shell\n  > pnpm audit --ignore-unfixable\n  ```\n\n  Provide a list of CVE's to ignore those specifically, even if they have a resolution.\n\n  ```shell\n  > pnpm audit --ignore=CVE-2021-1234 --ignore=CVE-2021-5678\n  ```\n\n- Added support for recursively running pack in every project of a workspace [#&#8203;4351](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/4351).\n\n  Now you can run `pnpm -r pack` to pack all packages in the workspace.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- pnpm version management should work, when `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` is set to `true` [#&#8203;9472](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9472).\n- `pnpm link` should work from inside a workspace [#&#8203;9506](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9506).\n- Set the default `workspaceConcurrency` to `Math.min(os.availableParallelism(), 4)` [#&#8203;9493](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9493).\n- Installation should not exit with an error if `strictPeerDependencies` is `true` but all issues are ignored by `peerDependencyRules` [#&#8203;9505](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9505).\n- Read `updateConfig` from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` [#&#8203;9500](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9500).\n- Add support for `recursive pack`\n- Remove `url.parse` usage to fix warning on Node.js 24 [#&#8203;9492](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9492).\n- `pnpm run` should be able to run commands from the workspace root, if `ignoreScripts` is set tot `true` [#&#8203;4858](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/4858).\n\n### [`v10.10.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#10100)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.9.0...v10.10.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Allow loading the `preResolution`, `importPackage`, and `fetchers` hooks from local pnpmfile.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `cd` command, when `shellEmulator` is `true` [#&#8203;7838](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/7838).\n- Sort keys in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` [#&#8203;9453](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9453).\n- Pass the `npm_package_json` environment variable to the executed scripts [#&#8203;9452](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9452).\n- Fixed a mistake in the description of the `--reporter=silent` option.\n\n### [`v10.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1090)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.8.1...v10.9.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- **Added support for installing JSR packages.** You can now install JSR packages using the following syntax:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm add jsr:<pkg_name>\n  ```\n\n  or with a version range:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm add jsr:<pkg_name>@&#8203;<range>\n  ```\n\n  For example, running:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm add jsr:@&#8203;foo/bar\n  ```\n\n  will add the following entry to your `package.json`:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"@&#8203;foo/bar\": \"jsr:^0.1.2\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  When publishing, this entry will be transformed into a format compatible with npm, older versions of Yarn, and previous pnpm versions:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"@&#8203;foo/bar\": \"npm:@&#8203;jsr/foo__bar@^0.1.2\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Related issue: [#&#8203;8941](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8941).\n\n  Note: The `@jsr` scope defaults to <https://npm.jsr.io/> if the `@jsr:registry` setting is not defined.\n\n- Added a new setting, `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds`, for automatically running any scripts of dependencies without the need to approve any builds. It was already possible to allow all builds by adding this to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:\n\n  ```yaml\n  neverBuiltDependencies: []\n  ```\n\n  `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` has the same effect but also allows to be set globally via:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm config set dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds true\n  ```\n\n  It can also be set when running a command:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm install --dangerously-allow-all-builds\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix a false negative in `verifyDepsBeforeRun` when `nodeLinker` is `hoisted` and there is a workspace package without dependencies and `node_modules` directory [#&#8203;9424](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9424).\n- Explicitly drop `verifyDepsBeforeRun` support for `nodeLinker: pnp`. Combining `verifyDepsBeforeRun` and `nodeLinker: pnp` will now print a warning.\n\n### [`v10.8.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1081)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.8.0...v10.8.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Removed bright white highlighting, which didn't look good on some light themes [#&#8203;9389](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9389).\n- If there is no pnpm related configuration in `package.json`, `onlyBuiltDependencies` will be written to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file [#&#8203;9404](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9404).\n\n### [`v10.8.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1080)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.7.1...v10.8.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- **Experimental.** A new hook is supported for updating configuration settings. The hook can be provided via `.pnpmfile.cjs`. For example:\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    hooks: {\n      updateConfig: (config) => ({\n        ...config,\n        nodeLinker: \"hoisted\",\n      }),\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- Now you can use the `pnpm add` command with the `--config` flag to install new configurational dependencies [#&#8203;9377](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9377).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Do not hang indefinitely, when there is a glob that starts with `!/` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. This fixes a regression introduced by [#&#8203;9169](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9169).\n- `pnpm audit --fix` should update the overrides in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.\n- `pnpm link` should update overrides in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, not in `package.json` [#&#8203;9365](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9365).\n\n### [`v10.7.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1071)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.7.0...v10.7.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `pnpm config set` should convert the settings to their correct type before adding them to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` [#&#8203;9355](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9355).\n- `pnpm config get` should read auth related settings via npm CLI [#&#8203;9345](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9345).\n- Replace leading `~/` in a path in `.npmrc` with the home directory [#&#8203;9217](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9217).\n\n### [`v10.7.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1070)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.5...v10.7.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- `pnpm config get` and `list` also show settings set in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` files [#&#8203;9316](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9316).\n\n- It should be possible to use env variables in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` setting names and value.\n\n- Add an ability to patch dependencies by version ranges. Exact versions override version ranges, which in turn override name-only patches. Version range `*` is the same as name-only, except that patch application failure will not be ignored.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```yaml\n  patchedDependencies:\n    foo: patches/foo-1.patch\n    foo@^2.0.0: patches/foo-2.patch\n    foo@2.1.0: patches/foo-3.patch\n  ```\n\n  The above configuration would apply `patches/foo-3.patch` to `foo@2.1.0`, `patches/foo-2.patch` to all `foo` versions which satisfy `^2.0.0` except `2.1.0`, and `patches/foo-1.patch` to the remaining `foo` versions.\n\n  > \\[!WARNING]\n  > The version ranges should not overlap. If you want to specialize a sub range, make sure to exclude it from the other keys. For example:\n  >\n  > ```yaml\n  > # pnpm-workspace.yaml\n  > patchedDependencies:\n  >   # the specialized sub range\n  >   'foo@2.2.0-2.8.0': patches/foo.2.2.0-2.8.0.patch\n  >   # the more general patch, excluding the sub range above\n  >   'foo@>=2.0.0 <2.2.0 || >2.8.0': 'patches/foo.gte2.patch\n  > ```\n  >\n  > In most cases, however, it's sufficient to just define an exact version to override the range.\n\n- `pnpm config set --location=project` saves the setting to a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file if no `.npmrc` file is present in the directory [#&#8203;9316](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9316).\n\n- Rename `pnpm.allowNonAppliedPatches` to `pnpm.allowUnusedPatches`. The old name is still supported but it would print a deprecation warning message.\n\n- Add `pnpm.ignorePatchFailures` to manage whether pnpm would ignore patch application failures.\n\n  If `ignorePatchFailures` is not set, pnpm would throw an error when patches with exact versions or version ranges fail to apply, and it would ignore failures from name-only patches.\n\n  If `ignorePatchFailures` is explicitly set to `false`, pnpm would throw an error when any type of patch fails to apply.\n\n  If `ignorePatchFailures` is explicitly set to `true`, pnpm would print a warning when any type of patch fails to apply.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Remove dependency paths from audit output to prevent out-of-memory errors [#&#8203;9280](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9280).\n\n### [`v10.6.5`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1065)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.4...v10.6.5)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Remove warnings after having explicitly approved no builds [#&#8203;9296](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9296).\n- When installing different dependency packages, should retain the `ignoredBuilds` field in the `.modules.yaml` file [#&#8203;9240](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9240).\n- Fix usages of the [`catalog:` protocol](https://pnpm.io/catalogs) in [injected local workspace packages](https://pnpm.io/package_json#dependenciesmetainjected). This previously errored with `ERR_PNPM_SPEC_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_ANY_RESOLVER`. [#&#8203;8715](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8715)\n- Setting `workspace-concurrency` to less than or equal to 0 should work [#&#8203;9297](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9297).\n\n### [`v10.6.4`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1064)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.3...v10.6.4)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `pnpm dlx` with `--allow-build` flag [#&#8203;9263](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9263).\n- Invalid Node.js version in `use-node-version` should not cause pnpm itself to break [#&#8203;9276](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9276).\n- The max amount of workers running for linking packages from the store has been reduced to 4 to achieve optimal results [#&#8203;9286](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9286). The workers are performing many file system operations, so increasing the number of CPUs doesn't help performance after some point.\n\n### [`v10.6.3`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1063)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.2...v10.6.3)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `pnpm install --prod=false` should not crash, when executed in a project with a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file [#&#8203;9233](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9233). This fixes regression introduced via [#&#8203;9211](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9211).\n- Add the missing `node-options` config to `recursive run` [#&#8203;9180](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9180).\n- Removed a branching code path that only executed when `dedupe-peer-dependents=false`. We believe this internal refactor will not result in behavior changes, but we expect it to make future pnpm versions behave more consistently for projects that override `dedupe-peer-dependents` to false. There should be less unique bugs from turning off `dedupe-peer-dependents`.\n\n  See details in [#&#8203;9259](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9259).\n\n### [`v10.6.2`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1062)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.1...v10.6.2)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `pnpm self-update` should always update the version in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`.\n- Fix running pnpm CLI from pnpm CLI on Windows when the CLI is bundled to an executable [#&#8203;8971](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8971).\n- `pnpm patch-commit` will now use the same filesystem as the store directory to compare and create patch files.\n- Don't show info output when `--loglevel=error` is used.\n- `peerDependencyRules` should be set in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to take effect.\n\n### [`v10.6.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1061)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.0...v10.6.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- The pnpm CLI process should not stay hanging, when `--silent` reporting is used.\n- When `--loglevel` is set to `error`, don't show installation summary, execution time, and big tarball download progress.\n- Don't ignore pnpm.patchedDependencies from `package.json` [#&#8203;9226](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9226).\n- When executing the `approve-builds` command, if package.json contains `onlyBuiltDependencies` or `ignoredBuiltDependencies`, the selected dependency package will continue to be written into `package.json`.\n- When a package version cannot be found in the package metadata, print the registry from which the package was fetched.\n\n### [`v10.6.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1060)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.5.2...v10.6.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` can now hold all the settings that `.npmrc` accepts. The settings should use camelCase [#&#8203;9211](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9211).\n\n  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` example:\n\n  ```yaml\n  verifyDepsBeforeRun: install\n  optimisticRepeatInstall: true\n  publicHoistPattern:\n    - \"*types*\"\n    - \"!@&#8203;types/react\"\n  ```\n\n- Projects using a `file:` dependency on a local tarball file (i.e. `.tgz`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar`) will see a performance improvement during installation. Previously, using a `file:` dependency on a tarball caused the lockfile resolution step to always run. The lockfile will now be considered up-to-date if the tarball is unchanged.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `pnpm self-update` should not leave a directory with a broken pnpm installation if the installation fails.\n- `fast-glob` replace with `tinyglobby` to reduce the size of the pnpm CLI dependencies [#&#8203;9169](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9169).\n- `pnpm deploy` should not remove fields from the deployed package's `package.json` file [#&#8203;9215](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9215).\n- `pnpm self-update` should not read the pnpm settings from the `package.json` file in the current working directory.\n- Fix `pnpm deploy` creating a `package.json` without the `imports` and `license` field [#&#8203;9193](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9193).\n- `pnpm update -i` should list only packages that have newer versions [#&#8203;9206](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9206).\n- Fix a bug causing entries in the `catalogs` section of the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to be removed when `dedupe-peer-dependents=false` on a filtered install.

Use the `sync-injected-deps-after-scripts` setting to specify which scripts build the workspace package. This tells pnpm when syncing is needed.

Example:\n\n  ```ini\n  sync-injected-deps-after-scripts[]=compile\n  ```\n\n- The `packages` field in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` became optional.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `pnpm link` with no parameters should work as if `--global` is specified [#&#8203;9151](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9151).\n- Allow scope registry CLI option without `--config.` prefix such as `--@&#8203;scope:registry=https://scope.example.com/npm` [#&#8203;9089](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9089).\n- `pnpm link <path>` should calculate relative path from the root of the workspace directory [#&#8203;9132](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9132).\n- Fix a bug causing catalog snapshots to be removed from the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file when using `--fix-lockfile` and `--filter`. [#&#8203;8639](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8639)\n- Fix a bug causing catalog protocol dependencies to not re-resolve on a filtered install [#&#8203;8638](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8638).\n\n### [`v10.4.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1041)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.4.0...v10.4.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Throws an error when the value provided by the `--allow-build` option overlaps with the `pnpm.ignoredBuildDependencies` list [#&#8203;9105](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9105).\n- Print pnpm's version after the execution time at the end of the console output.\n- Print warning about ignored builds of dependencies on repeat install [#&#8203;9106](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9106).\n- Setting `init-package-manager` should work.\n\n### [`v10.4.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1040)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.3.0...v10.4.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- `pnpm approve-builds --global` works now for allowing dependencies of globally installed packages to run postinstall scripts.\n\n- The `pnpm add` command now supports a new flag, `--allow-build`, which allows building the specified dependencies. For instance, if you want to install a package called `bundle` that has `esbuild` as a dependency and want to allow `esbuild` to run postinstall scripts, you can run:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm --allow-build=esbuild add bundle\n  ```\n\n  This will run `esbuild`'s postinstall script and also add it to the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` field of `package.json`. So, `esbuild` will always be allowed to run its scripts in the future.\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;9086](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9086).\n\n- The `pnpm init` command adds a `packageManager` field with the current version of pnpm CLI [#&#8203;9069](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9069). To disable this behaviour, set the `init-package-manager` setting to `false`.\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- `pnpm approve-builds` should work after two consecutive `pnpm install` runs [#&#8203;9083](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9083).\n- Fix instruction for updating pnpm with corepack [#&#8203;9101](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9101).\n- The pnpm version specified by `packageManager` cannot start with `v`.\n\n### [`v10.3.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1030)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.2.1...v10.3.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Added a new setting called `strict-dep-builds`. When enabled, the installation will exit with a non-zero exit code if any dependencies have unreviewed build scripts (aka postinstall scripts) [#&#8203;9071](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9071).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix a false negative of `verify-deps-before-run` after `pnpm install --production|--no-optional` [#&#8203;9019](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9019).\n- Print the warning about blocked installation scripts at the end of the installation output and make it more prominent.\n\n### [`v10.2.1`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1021)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.2.0...v10.2.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Don't read a package from side-effects cache if it isn't allowed to be built [#&#8203;9042](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9042).\n- `pnpm approve-builds` should work, when executed from a subdirectory of a workspace [#&#8203;9042](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9042).\n- `pnpm deploy --legacy` should work without injected dependencies.\n- Add information about how to deploy without \"injected dependencies\" to the \"pnpm deploy\" error message.\n\n### [`v10.2.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1020)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.1.0...v10.2.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Packages executed via `pnpm dlx` and `pnpm create` are allowed to be built (run postinstall scripts) by default.\n\n  If the packages executed by `dlx` or `create` have dependencies that have to be built, they should be listed via the `--allow-build` flag. For instance, if you want to run a package called `bundle` that has `esbuild` in dependencies and want to allow `esbuild` to run postinstall scripts, run:\n\n  ```\n  pnpm --allow-build=esbuild dlx bundle\n  ```\n\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;9026](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9026).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Quote args for scripts with shell-quote to support new lines (on POSIX only) [#&#8203;8980](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8980).\n- Fix a bug in which `pnpm deploy` fails to read the correct `projectId` when the deploy source is the same as the workspace directory [#&#8203;9001](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9001).\n- Proxy settings should be respected, when resolving Git-hosted dependencies [#&#8203;6530](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/6530).\n- Prevent `overrides` from adding invalid version ranges to `peerDependencies` by keeping the `peerDependencies` and overriding them with prod `dependencies` [#&#8203;8978](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8978).\n- Sort the package names in the \"pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies\" list saved by `pnpm approve-builds`.\n\n### [`v10.1.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1010)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.0.0...v10.1.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Added a new command for printing the list of dependencies with ignored build scripts: `pnpm ignored-builds` [#&#8203;8963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8963).\n- Added a new command for approving dependencies for running scripts during installation: `pnpm approve-builds` [#&#8203;8963](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8963).\n- Added a new setting called `optimistic-repeat-install`. When enabled, a fast check will be performed before proceeding to installation. This way a repeat install or an install on a project with everything up-to-date becomes a lot faster. But some edge cases might arise, so we keep it disabled by default for now [#&#8203;8977](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8977).\n- Added a new field \"pnpm.ignoredBuiltDependencies\" for explicitly listing packages that should not be built. When a package is in the list, pnpm will not print an info message about that package not being built [#&#8203;8935](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8935).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Verify that the package name is valid when executing the publish command.\n- When running `pnpm install`, the `preprepare` and `postprepare` scripts of the project should be executed [#&#8203;8989](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8989).\n- Allow `workspace:` and `catalog:` to be part of wider version range in `peerDependencies`.\n- `pnpm deploy` should inherit the `pnpm` object from the root `package.json` [#&#8203;8991](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8991).\n- Make sure that the deletion of a `node_modules` in a sub-project of a monorepo is detected as out-of-date [#&#8203;8959](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8959).\n- Fix infinite loop caused by lifecycle scripts using `pnpm` to execute other scripts during `pnpm install` with `verify-deps-before-run=install` [#&#8203;8954](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8954).\n- Replace `strip-ansi` with the built-in `util.stripVTControlCharacters` [#&#8203;9009](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9009).\n- Do not print patched dependencies as ignored dependencies that require a build [#&#8203;8952](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8952).\n\n### [`v10.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1000)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.15.9...v10.0.0)\n\n##### Major Changes\n\n- Lifecycle scripts of dependencies are not executed during installation by default! This is a breaking change aimed at increasing security. In order to allow lifecycle scripts of specific dependencies, they should be listed in the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` field of `package.json` [#&#8203;8897](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8897). For example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"pnpm\": {\n      \"onlyBuiltDependencies\": [\"fsevents\"]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `pnpm link` behavior updated:\n\n  The `pnpm link` command now adds overrides to the root `package.json`.\n\n  - In a workspace: The override is added to the root of the workspace, linking the dependency to all projects in the workspace.\n  - Global linking: To link a package globally, run `pnpm link` from the package’s directory. Previously, you needed to use `pnpm link -g`.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8653](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8653)\n\n- Secure hashing with SHA256:\n\n  Various hashing algorithms have been updated to SHA256 for enhanced security and consistency:\n\n  - Long paths inside `node_modules/.pnpm` are now hashed with SHA256.\n  - Long peer dependency hashes in the lockfile now use SHA256 instead of MD5. (This affects very few users since these are only used for long keys.)\n  - The hash stored in the `packageExtensionsChecksum` field of `pnpm-lock.yaml` is now SHA256.\n  - The side effects cache keys now use SHA256.\n  - The pnpmfile checksum in the lockfile now uses SHA256 ([#&#8203;8530](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8530)).\n\n- Configuration updates:\n\n  - `manage-package-manager-versions`: enabled by default. pnpm now manages its own version based on the `packageManager` field in `package.json` by default.\n\n  - `public-hoist-pattern`: nothing is hoisted by default. Packages containing `eslint` or `prettier` in their name are no longer hoisted to the root of `node_modules`. Related Issue: [#&#8203;8378](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8378)\n\n  - Upgraded `@yarnpkg/extensions` to v2.0.3. This may alter your lockfile.\n\n  - `virtual-store-dir-max-length`: the default value on Windows has been reduced to 60 characters.\n\n  - Reduced environment variables for scripts:\n    During script execution, fewer `npm_package_*` environment variables are set. Only `name`, `version`, `bin`, `engines`, and `config` remain.\n    Related Issue: [#&#8203;8552](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8552)\n\n  - All dependencies are now installed even if `NODE_ENV=production`. Related Issue: [#&#8203;8827](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8827)\n\n- Changes to the global store:\n\n  - Store version bumped to v10.\n\n  - Some registries allow identical content to be published under different package names or versions. To accommodate this, index files in the store are now stored using both the content hash and package identifier.\n\n    This approach ensures that we can:\n\n    1. Validate that the integrity in the lockfile corresponds to the correct package, which might not be the case after a poorly resolved Git conflict.\n    2. Allow the same content to be referenced by different packages or different versions of the same package.\n       Related PR: [#&#8203;8510](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8510)\n       Related Issue: [#&#8203;8204](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8204)\n\n  - More efficient side effects indexing. The structure of index files in the store has changed. Side effects are now tracked more efficiently by listing only file differences rather than all files.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8636](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8636)\n\n  - A new `index` directory stores package content mappings. Previously, these files were in `files`.\n\n- Other breaking changes:\n  - The `#` character is now escaped in directory names within `node_modules/.pnpm`.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8557](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8557)\n  - Running `pnpm add --global pnpm` or `pnpm add --global @&#8203;pnpm/exe` now fails with an error message, directing you to use `pnpm self-update` instead.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8728](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8728)\n  - Dependencies added via a URL now record the final resolved URL in the lockfile, ensuring that any redirects are fully captured.\n    Related Issue: [#&#8203;8833](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8833)\n  - The `pnpm deploy` command now only works in workspaces that have `inject-workspace-packages=true`. This limitation is introduced to allow us to create a proper lockfile for the deployed project using the workspace lockfile.\n  - Removed conversion from lockfile v6 to v9. If you need v6-to-v9 conversion, use pnpm CLI v9.\n  - `pnpm test` now passes all parameters after the `test` keyword directly to the underlying script. This matches the behavior of `pnpm run test`. Previously you needed to use the `--` prefix.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8619](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8619)\n\n- `node-gyp` updated to version 11.\n\n- `pnpm deploy` now tries creating a dedicated lockfile from a shared lockfile for deployment. It will fallback to deployment without a lockfile if there is no shared lockfile or `force-legacy-deploy` is set to `true`.\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Added support for a new type of dependencies called \"configurational dependencies\". These dependencies are installed before all the other types of dependencies (before \"dependencies\", \"devDependencies\", \"optionalDependencies\").\n\n  Configurational dependencies cannot have dependencies of their own or lifecycle scripts. They should be added using exact version and the integrity checksum. Example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"pnpm\": {\n      \"configDependencies\": {\n        \"my-configs\": \"1.0.0+sha512-30iZtAPgz+LTIYoeivqYo853f02jBYSd5uGnGpkFV0M3xOt9aN73erkgYAmZU43x4VfqcnLxW9Kpg3R5LC4YYw==\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Related RFC: [#&#8203;8](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/rfcs/pull/8).\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;8915](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8915).\n\n- New settings:\n\n  - New `verify-deps-before-run` setting. This setting controls how `pnpm` checks `node_modules` before running scripts:\n\n    - `install`: Automatically run `pnpm install` if `node_modules` is outdated.\n    - `warn`: Print a warning if `node_modules` is outdated.\n    - `prompt`: Prompt the user to confirm running `pnpm install` if `node_modules` is outdated.\n    - `error`: Throw an error if `node_modules` is outdated.\n    - `false`: Disable dependency checks.\n      Related Issue: [#&#8203;8585](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8585)\n\n  - New `inject-workspace-packages` setting enables hard-linking all local workspace dependencies instead of symlinking them. Previously, this could be achieved using [`dependenciesMeta[].injected`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#dependenciesmetainjected), which remains supported.\n    Related PR: [#&#8203;8836](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8836)\n\n- Faster repeat installs:\n\n  On repeated installs, `pnpm` performs a quick check to ensure `node_modules` is up to date.\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;8838](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8838)\n\n- `pnpm add` integrates with default workspace catalog:\n\n  When adding a dependency, `pnpm add` checks the default workspace catalog. If the dependency and version requirement match the catalog, `pnpm add` uses the `catalog:` protocol. Without a specified version, it matches the catalog’s version. If it doesn’t match, it falls back to standard behavior.\n  Related Issue: [#&#8203;8640](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8640)\n\n- `pnpm dlx` now resolves packages to their exact versions and uses these exact versions for cache keys. This ensures `pnpm dlx` always installs the latest requested packages.\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;8811](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8811)\n\n- No `node_modules` validation on certain commands. Commands that should not modify `node_modules` (e.g., `pnpm install --lockfile-only`) no longer validate or purge `node_modules`.\n  Related PR: [#&#8203;8657](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8657)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I have already spent ~35h on that, close to the end but still... something ongoing. (Just a context - our project started with angular 5, and was migrated every 1-2 versions during these years).\n\nFirst of all what concerns me already for some time, is `inject` instead of constructor injection. I am a java background developer, with a strong Spring framework fundamentals. The story there was (except xml beans injection) was primary an `@Autowired` annotation, which allowed for field based injection. Latter it was changed to constructor based injection, because of portability, easier reading, testing, performance. I feel we have a circle there, in terms - you will get back to that idea. And that lint does not make me happy, even more:\n\n<img width=\"1463\" height=\"202\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d125f11-eeab-4c9e-800d-4b1ab1660704\" />\n\nalso see that: https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/12kk84j/why_i_should_use_angular_14s_new_inject_instead/\n\nSecond, I have no idea why, but my prettier failed to format the code as it was before (finally I needed to update eslint because the used version did not work with the ts used after migration). I did all automated migrations which were required :) Maybe it is NX fault, maybe Angular team. I do not know. Same with SCSS and `import` warnings. Standalone migration failed as well (in another project when I was migrating from 18 to 19 it was more smoth but still not no-op on my side), I needed to make all by hand.\n\nLastly, another migration, another bug debuggings. Currently my biggest unicorn is \"why our components are showing up from the bottom after rendering\". No changes in styles, but after adding them with `ViewContainerRef` these drives from the bottom. I removed all animations (in angular component declaration, and also `transition` in css) , it still happens the same way. I could expect a nicer experience, not spending hours every migration on bug spotting.\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63075","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular 20 feedback after migrating from 18\" (#63075)"},{"Id":"3306902930","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-09T22:07:06","Actor":"ErfanMirzapour","Number":"63074","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update expression-syntax.md (typo)","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.dev application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In a zoneless Angular project, they are reported twice.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create a new Angular project.\n2. Paste the code below into a spec file.\n3. `npm t`\n\n```\nit('triggers an unhandled rejection', function(done) {\n\tPromise.reject(new Error('nope'));\n\n\t// Make sure the unhandled rejection event has plenty of time to fire before\n\t// Jasmine finishes running. This helps distinguish between timing issues\n\t// (event is firing a bit later than usual) and the event not firing at all.\n\tsetTimeout(done, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nExpected result: The spec should fail with a single \"Unhandled promise\nrejection: Error: nope\" error.\n\nObserved:\n* If the project was set up zoneless, the spec fails with two copies of the expected error.\n* Otherwise, the spec passes.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/sgravrock/ng-unhandled-rejection\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you

This makes MCP unusable for many common monorepo layouts.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate folder structure like this:\n\n```\nrepo-root/\n  README.md\n  .vscode/\n    mcp.json\n  apps/\n    project-anga/\n      angular.json ...\n    project-angb/\n      angular.json ...\n    project-backa/\n      package.json ...\n```\n\nInstall mcp server as defined in `ng mcp`.\n\n```\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"angular-cli\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@angular/cli\",\n        \"mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"inputs\": []\n}\n```\n\nThen ask which project are in angular application in chat.\n\n<img width=\"620\" height=\"651\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/650bc906-2d25-44e1-9ba0-05adafdee417\" />\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.1.4\nNode: 22.17.1\nPackage Manager: npm 11.5.2\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: \n... \n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2001.4 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/core         20.1.4 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.1.4 (cli-only)\n@schematics/angular          20.1.4 (cli-only)\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30855","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI MCP cannot detect projects in monorepo\" (#30855)"},{"Id":"3301101501","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-08T07:50:14","Actor":"SebastianPost1996","Number":"30849","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular CLI >= 20.1.0 - Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncli\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nAs of CLI version 20.1.0, running any `ng` command, regardless of the project and even in a global context, results in the error below.\nVersion 20.0.6 does not result in an error.\n\n```\nUnknown error: Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module C:\\Users\\SebastianPost\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\@angular\\cli\\node_modules\\yargs\\helpers\\helpers.mjs from C:\\Users\\SebastianPost\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\@angular\\cli\\src\\command-builder\\command-module.js not supported.\nInstead change the require of C:\\Users\\SebastianPost\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\@angular\\cli\\node_modules\\yargs\\helpers\\helpers.mjs to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.\n```\n\n<img width=\"1457\" height=\"437\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edc16a36-da42-4c35-a1f1-48d0f9f7ac78\" />\n\n\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.1.0\nNode: 22.18.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.9.3\nOS: win32 x64\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30849","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular CLI >= 20.1.0 - Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]\" (#30849)"},{"Id":"3297808831","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T15:16:35","Actor":"clydin","Number":"30844","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular/build): provide private component stylesheet bundling API for internal compilation infrastructure","State":"closed","Body":"The `ComponentStylesheetBundler` class is now available from the `private` entry point for the `@angular/build` package.

Connect physical keyboard to the Android device (e.g. bluetooth keyboard connected to Mobile with Android).\n4. Open the app and use the Tab key to navigate through the page elements.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen tabbing towards a mat-form-field, focus should move directly from the previously focused element to the inner `<input>` element. The wrapper _div (.mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper)_ should be skipped entirely in the tab order, as it is not an interactive control itself.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe keyboard focus first lands on the _div.mat-mdc-text-field-wrapper_. The user must then press Tab a second time to move focus from the wrapper to the actual `<input>` element. This creates a \"ghost\" tab stop that provides no user-facing functionality and disrupts the logical navigation flow.\n\n### Environment\n\n- **Angular:** any from 5.2.5 to 20.1.5 (latest)\n- **CDK/Material:** any from 5.2.5 to 20.1.5 (latest)\n- **Browser(s):** Android System WebView\n- **Operating System:** verified on Android 14 and 15","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31669","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Accessibility: mat-form-field redundant focus on Android WebView with keyboard\" (#31669)"},{"Id":"3299992807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T10:51:50","Actor":"benelliott","Number":"31668","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(M2 theming): M2 theming guide references defunct background and foreground palettes","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nSince the release of 20.1.0, Material 2 components no longer use the `background` and `foreground` palettes for neutral colours (such as default-colour button backgrounds). However, these are still referenced in the Material 2 Theming guide - both in terms of the palette tokens being listed out, and in terms of being able to read the palette values via `mat.get-theme-color`. \n\nIn my opinion the fact that these are documented strengthens the argument that the move to `_mat-system` is a breaking change that should have been pushed to the next major release. Regardless, there is now a bug with the documentation because it references these outdated tokens that no longer do what the documentation claims.\n\n(More discussion in #31630)\n\n### Affected documentation page\n\nhttps://material.angular.dev/guide/material-2-theming#reading-values-from-a-theme","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31668","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs-bug(M2 theming): M2 theming guide references defunct background and foreground palettes\" (#31668)"},{"Id":"3299690821","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T09:14:12","Actor":"6apc1k","Number":"31667","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(timepicker): Support for seconds","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nCurrently, the timepicker only allows selection of hours and minutes.

build a solution for our customers that is used on many different devices, including TV's and their browsers, or smartboards.\r\nThe problem I am running into is that some of these devices do fail to setup the angular app and since it is a device with no development toolbars or any access into what caused the error, I am blind as to watch is causing the issue.\r\n\r\nI am using an App Error Handler, which can report errors to our slack channel, but that only works if the Angular app was launched correctly.\r\n\r\nI created a little mini project to try report an error in the browser if the JS fails to load, but that is not a complete reflection of our product. \r\nWith that I found that some TV's don't like Nullish_coalescing_assignment operator (??=) and I could use browserlistrc to force Safari >= 13 which get's rid of that operator.\r\nBut now I am facing another error which results in a white screen.\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n\r\nSolution: it would be great it Angular had some kind of try/catch mechanism which could report on errors that occur trying to load the angular app and it can be printed in the window. \r\nI know it will be crude, but at least it is better than a white screen.\r\nIt could show that the angular app failed to load because of this specific reason and show the stack trace if possible.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nMaybe the consensus is that this is not Angular's responsibility  and it should be dealt with by the developer.\r\nBut then it would be nice to maybe create a blog about this with pointers for others so we can deal with the nightmare of supporting a wide range of devices.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56510","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Provide a option to print an error report in the browser

This promise already resolves in an `afterNextRender` hook and is only used directly by the browser's view transition machinery.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/56494","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): Delay the view transition to ensure renders in microtask…\" (#56494)"},{"Id":"2360105050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-18T15:30:08","Actor":"alaindeurveilher","Number":"56492","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot run test with ChromeHeadless in Continuous Integration","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\ncore\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to make my CICD work with GitLab CICD runner, but the test job fails.\r\n\r\nI followed the instructions on the documentation:\r\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/testing#testing-in-continuous-integration\r\n\r\nSo, in my .gitlab-ci.yml I configured my job as so:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ntest:\r\n  image: artifactory.my-organisation/docker/node:20\r\n  before_script:\r\n    - yarn install\r\n  script:\r\n    - yarn test:cicd\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the test script is defined as so in the package.json:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test\": \"yarn generate:libs:local && ng test\",\r\n    \"test:once\": \"yarn test --no-watch\",\r\n    \"test:cicd\": \"yarn test:once --no-progress --browsers=ChromeHeadless\",\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that ultimately the following command in executed in my node container:\r\n`ng test --no-watch --no-progress --browsers=ChromeHeadless`\r\n\r\nBut the job fails with the following error, which is not documented in the testing section of the Angular documentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR [launcher]: No binary for ChromeHeadless browser on your platform.\r\n  Please, set \"CHROME_BIN\" env variable.\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would be the correct setup please?\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nERROR [launcher]: No binary for ChromeHeadless browser on your platform.\r\n  Please, set \"CHROME_BIN\" env variable.\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\n\"@angular/core\": \"^17.3.11\",\r\n\"karma\": \"~6.4.0\",\r\n\"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~3.2.0\",\r\n\r\nDocker image: node:20\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56492","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Cannot run test with ChromeHeadless in Continuous Integration\" (#56492)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2363421929","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-20T03:23:37","Actor":"Milldrew","Number":"27884","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature 🏗 option to generate cfile compatible error file","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nserve\n\n### Description\n\n```\r\nng serve --error-file\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command would generate a file in the root of the angular workspace that would track the current errors\r\n\r\nerror-file.txt\r\n```\r\n/Users/milldrew/readme.txt:2:2:angular error code message\r\n/Users/milldrew/readme.txt:10:2:angular error code message\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin vim we could run the cfile command to go directly to the line and column of the error\r\n```\r\n:cfile error-file.txt\r\n```\r\nto read about cfile in vim\r\n```\r\n:h cfile\r\n```\r\nThis will make it easy for vim users to write small vim scripts that handle angular project navigation powerfully\r\n\r\nI can build this feature for the command line and write the docs if this feature is approved.

This arose in https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url/issues/274 and https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-6210.\r\n\r\nI believe the problem is the Angular compiler generating a SSR bundle, because this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst AsyncIteratorPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(async function* () {}).prototype);\r\n```\r\n\r\nturns into \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n    var AsyncIteratorPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(function() {\r\n      return __asyncGenerator(this, null, function* () {\r\n      });\r\n    }).prototype);\r\n```\r\n\r\nonly when I run `npm run build` using the ng compiler (see the example repro).  Compiling the TS doesn't perform this transformation.\r\n\r\nRegardless, `Object.getPrototypeOf(function() {\r\n      return __asyncGenerator(this, null, function* () {\r\n      });\r\n    })` returns undefined when using Angular SSR and the the code throws a type error.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI created a reproduction that's a lightly modified version of the starter template (`npx @angular/cli new app-name-mongodb`, enable SSR).\r\n\r\nClone https://github.com/baileympearson/angularssr-whatwg-url-repro.\r\nInstall deps (`npm install`).\r\nBuild the project (`npm run watch` or `npm run build`).\r\nAttempt to serve the project (`npm run serve:ssr:app-name-mongodb`).\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nfile:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/server.mjs:31422\r\n    var AsyncIteratorPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(function() {\r\n                                        ^\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object\r\n    at Function.getPrototypeOf (<anonymous>)\r\n    at node_modules/whatwg-url/lib/utils.js (file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/server.mjs:31422:41)\r\n    at __require2 (file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/chunk-YBYOXPTQ.mjs:51:50)\r\n    at node_modules/whatwg-url/lib/URL.js (file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/server.mjs:34219:17)\r\n    at __require2 (file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/chunk-YBYOXPTQ.mjs:51:50)\r\n    at node_modules/whatwg-url/webidl2js-wrapper.js (file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/server.mjs:34593:16)\r\n    at __require2 (file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/chunk-YBYOXPTQ.mjs:51:50)\r\n    at node_modules/whatwg-url/index.js (file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/server.mjs:34604:42)\r\n    at __require2 (file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/chunk-YBYOXPTQ.mjs:51:50)\r\n    at file:///Users/bailey.pearson/dev/app-name-mongodb/dist/app-name-mongodb/server/server.mjs:40427:1\n```\n\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\n18.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27880","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"SSR compiled code throws when loading whatwg-url package\" (#27880)"},{"Id":"2359946497","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-18T14:23:51","Actor":"clydin","Number":"27876","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): use Node.js available parallelism for default worker count","State":"closed","Body":"The Node.js `os.availableParallelism` API now provides more accurate values when used within containers such as many CI environments.

Please see the minimal example using ifdef-loader (https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/grapehunter/ngtool_webpack_show):\r\n\r\n**webpack.config.json**\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = (env) => {\r\n    ...\r\n    module: {\r\n      rules: [\r\n        {\r\n          test: /\\.[cm]?[tj]sx?$/,\r\n          resolve: { fullySpecified: false },\r\n          exclude:\r\n            /[\\\\/]node_modules[/\\\\](?:core-js|@babel|tslib|web-animations-js|web-streams-polyfill|whatwg-url)[/\\\\]/,\r\n          use: [\r\n            { loader: \"ifdef-loader\", options: { DEBUG: !isProduction } }, \r\n            { loader: path.resolve(__dirname, \"./scripts/trace-loader.cjs\") }, // log source code in pipeline\r\n            {\r\n              loader: \"@ngtools/webpack\",\r\n            },\r\n          ],\r\n        },\r\n      ],\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**index.ts**\r\n```ts\r\n...\r\n/// #if DEBUG\r\nalert(\"Running in development mode!\");\r\n/// #else\r\nalert(\"Running in production mode!\");\r\n/// #endif\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"app-root\",\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  /// #if DEBUG\r\n  template: ` <h1>Hello from development!</h1> `,\r\n  /// #else\r\n  // @ts-ignore\r\n  template: ` <h1>Hello from production!</h1> `,\r\n  /// #endif\r\n})\r\nexport class App {}\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, {\r\n  providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()],\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. If the example code is executed first by @ngtools/webpack (AngularWebpackPlugin), then the code processed by @ngtools/webpack is printed out as follows through trace-loader.cjs:\r\n```ts\r\n/// #if DEBUG\r\nalert(\"Running in development mode!\");\r\n/// #else\r\nalert(\"Running in production mode!\");\r\n/// #endif\r\nexport class App {\r\n}\r\nApp.ɵfac = function App_Factory(t) { return new (t || App)(); };\r\nApp.ɵcmp = /*@__PURE__*/ i0.ɵɵdefineComponent({ type: App, selectors: [[\"app-root\"]], standalone: true, features: [i0.ɵɵStandaloneFeature], decls: 2, vars: 0, template: function App_Template(rf, ctx) { if (rf & 1) {\r\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(0, \"h1\");\r\n        i0.ɵɵtext(1, \"Hello from production!\");\r\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\r\n    } }, encapsulation: 2 });\r\nbootstrapApplication(App, {\r\n    providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()],\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, after @ngtools/webpack compilation, the commented code within the @Component scope disappears. Thus, when ifdef-loader receives the code, it cannot process the second /// #if DEBUG in main.ts, leading to incorrect page output (`Hello from production!` instead of the correct `Hello from development!`).\r\n\r\n2. If { loader: \"ifdef-loader\", options: { DEBUG: !isProduction } } is placed below @ngtools/webpack, i.e., ifdef-loader is executed first and then @ngtools/webpack. Since @ngtools/webpack internally loads source files from the path, not through the loader pipeline, the final compiled result will ignore any changes made by ifdef-loader to the code.\r\nHere is an example of an incorrectly executed project: https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/grapehunter/ngtool_webpack_show\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n## The modification method I am currently using\r\nI currently preprocess the code by patching the AngularWebpackPlugin configuration parameters of @ngtools/webpack to add a sourceModifier. \r\nThe patch file is as follows:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/plugin.js b/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/plugin.js\r\nindex 9c970d0..8c00f1f 100644\r\n--- a/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/plugin.js\r\n+++ b/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/ivy/plugin.js\r\n@@ -139,7 +139,7 @@ class AngularWebpackPlugin {\r\n         // Webpack lacks an InputFileSytem type definition with sync functions\r\n-        compiler.inputFileSystem, (0, paths_1.normalizePath)(compiler.context));\r\n+        compiler.inputFileSystem, (0, paths_1.normalizePath)(compiler.context), this.pluginOptions.sourceModifier ??

It should be compatible with Android TV so I am testing the behaviour on Chromecast 2 using the dpad controller. Only available controls are the 4 directional arrows with Back and Enter.\r\nMy first page has a mat-tab-nav-bar at the top. On page load, the Chromecast browser focuses the first element and then let the user navigate in the page only using the previously listed controls. \r\nAs mat tabs enables keyboard navigation, it is switching tabs focus with arrow keys and changing active tab with Enter. But because dpads is missing Tab key, it becomes impossible to focus out the tabs and click on next elements.\r\nWe would need a way to configure the mat tabs to focus to next elements with arrows when last element has been reached instead of looping back to the first tab. That would allow dpad to navigate to the rest of the page.\r\nAny known hack to make this work would be more than welcome!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/examples#tab-group-align\r\nSteps to reproduce the same behaviour in a browser:\r\n1. Use tab to enter focus on first tabs bar\r\n2. Use only arrows and Enter and try to navigate in the whole page\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen last element is selected and right arrow key is pressed, have a way to jump to next element (like a Tab) instead of going back to first tab element.\r\nWhen first element is selected and left arrow key is pressed, have a way to jump to previous element (like a Shift+Tab) instead of going to last tab element.\r\nThis could be done with some config maybe to stay compatible with current behaviour\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen last element is selected and right arrow key is pressed it is going back to first tab element.\r\nWhen first element is selected and left arrow key is pressedit is going to last tab element.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 18\r\n- CDK/Material: 18\r\n- Browser(s): Chromecast browser\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Android TV\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29284","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-tab-nav-bar): Accessibility issue with dpad navigation in mat tabs\" (#29284)"},{"Id":"2361517764","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-19T10:35:32","Actor":"msftedad","Number":"29281","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to access the controls in the \"Rearrange columns\" dialog with the keyboard.","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\n**Environment (OS, Application, Versions):**\r\nOS Build: Windows 11 Enterprise 23H2 22631.3672\r\nEdge Dev Version: Version 125.0.2535.85 (Official build) dev (64-bit)\r\n\r\n**Repro Steps:**\r\n1.

It will always be at least as accurate as the user's sizes value, and will often be more accurate. In cases where the user has erroneously fallen back to `sizes=\"100vw\"`, using `sizes=\"auto\"` could reduce image download by 50% or more.\r\n\r\nOn [browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlimageelement_sizes_auto) which do not support sizes=\"auto\", it is simply ignored, and srcset selection behavior will be unchanged.\r\n\r\nWhen browser adoption for `sizes=\"auto\"` increases, the behavior of NgOptimizedImage could be changed to rely on `sizes=\"auto\"` completely for lazy loaded images, without requiring the user to provide `sizes` at all. However, give the current partial state of adoption, I think this smaller change is the best option--it improves loading performance in some cases, and never makes it worse.\r\n\r\nCC: @AndrewKushnir @kara ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57479","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(common): automatically use sizes auto in NgOptimizedImage\" (#57479)"},{"Id":"2478724849","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-21T18:26:39","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"57478","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]","State":"open","Body":"Updated Angular CLI help contents.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57478","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: update Angular CLI help [main]\" (#57478)"},{"Id":"2476557047","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-21T18:26:29","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"57465","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): fix regressions around members & deprecations","State":"closed","Body":"This commit fixes regressions introduced by #57255\r\n\r\nDemo: \r\n* Interface members:  https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-57465-adev-prev-vodn78k4.web.app/api/router/CanMatch\r\n* deprecations : https://ng-dev-previews-fw--pr-angular-angular-57465-adev-prev-vodn78k4.web.app/api/forms/FormBuilder","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57465","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(docs-infra): fix regressions around members & deprecations\" (#57465)"},{"Id":"2478094762","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-21T18:25:56","Actor":"steciuk","Number":"57472","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove extra space in DI example code","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

While this feature works perfectly for end users and does not impact the functionality of the site, it has caused a significant issue with SEO. After deploying the site, I checked the rendered pages in Google Search Console. The screenshots captured by Google's crawler show a blank (white) page instead of the actual content. This suggests that the Google crawler is unable to properly render the content when enableViewTransitions is enabled, leading to potential SEO issues as the pages appear empty to the crawler.\r\n\r\nIssue 2: Component Instantiation in Hierarchical Components\r\nAdditionally, I noticed a strange behavior when adding console logs in the constructors of hierarchical components (parent-child structure). Only the AppComponent was instantiated and logged in the console, while none of the child components were instantiated. This is unexpected and may indicate an issue with how components are being initialized in a hierarchical structure in this version of Angular.\r\n\r\nThese issues do not affect the user experience or the site's functionality, but they do present a significant problem for SEO. I hope the Angular team can investigate and address these problems.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to these matters.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nVahid\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a

This means that in version 17 and earlier the behavior is like eventCoalescing to false -- won't scroll to the top\". \r\nso I will say \"no scroll to the top\" is the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 18, Angular sets eventCoalescing to true by default, and zoneless mode is expected to become the default in the future. This change in behavior could cause problems. If the Angular Team does not consider this a bug, it should be clearly highlighted in the documentation.\r\n\r\nWhy it happened? (I guess)\r\nAfter insertView, ChangeDetectionScheduler.notify is triggered, but refreshView does not run immediately. instead, it runs after a setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame. In the example above, the template contains an @for. Due to the delay, the content is removed first, and then the browser renders. At this point, the @for hasn't executed yet, so there are no elements in the body, causing scrollTop jump to 0. After the timeout, the @for runs, but scrollTop can no longer automatically return to its previous position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/keatkeat87/ng-routing-zone-v18.git\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 18.2.0\r\nNode: 20.11.1\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 18.2.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             18.2.0\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.5.4\r\nzone.js                         0.14.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57460","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Routing Bug - eventCoalescing true cause scroll to top\" (#57460)"},{"Id":"2478259776","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-20T16:56:19","Actor":"shadow1349","Number":"57473","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug: export 'ɵɵInputFlags' (imported as 'i0') was not found in '@angular/core' ","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n17.3.2\n\n### Description\n\nI have a project that I started on Angular 17 and I just updated to Angular 18.

The parent component is in a library module that we have lazy loaded in a showcase app. The animations work fine on components that are not lazy loaded i a separate module, but when going to a route that lazy loads a seperate module the child components animation no longer fire and eventually with enough navigation in the module the components no longer get removed from the router-outlet and start just appending on top of each other.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\n\"@angular/animations\": \"^18.1.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^18.1.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^18.1.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^18.1.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^18.1.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^18.1.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^18.1.4\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^18.1.4\",\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57459","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Animation of Child component is not firing when component is loaded from lazy loaded module\" (#57459)"},{"Id":"2475373935","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-20T11:11:22","Actor":"9kubczas4","Number":"57458","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(docs-infra): add top level banner component","State":"open","Body":"docs(docs-infra): add top level banner component\r\n\r\n- create top level banner component\r\n- write unit tests\r\n- close banner and keep state in the local storage\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

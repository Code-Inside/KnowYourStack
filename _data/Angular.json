This class is available for use in all browsers and Node.js\r\nversions supported by the Angular framework (https://caniuse.com/textencoder). The\r\ncustom encoder is still used by the compiler's source map generator and cannot yet be\r\nfully removed.\r\nThe native UTF-8 encoder (`TextEncoder`) provides its output as a `Uint8Array`\r\nwhich is a specialized `TypedArray` for storing byte values. To remove the need\r\nto copy and transform this data multiple times, a `DataView` is used to allow\r\nfor low-level access to the data in a variety of bit-widths and endianness.\r\nThe `DataView` class is natively available and supported by all browsers and\r\nNode.js versions support by the framework (https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_dataview).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48256","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Initial modernization refactor for i18n digest generation\" (#48256)"},{"Id":"1466709478","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-28T16:25:25","Actor":"sharshuv-quotient","Number":"48255","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make FormControlName directive typed","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\nforms\n\n### Description\n\nthe biggest disadvantage of the `FormControlName` directive is that it's not typed.

These styles are scoped to the component.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to use other UI frameworks (eg. Bootstrap, Tailwind, ...), to write a component library for angular.\r\nAt the moment the only way I know to achieve this is like this:\r\n\r\n    @Component({\r\n      selector: 'bs-accordion',\r\n      styleUrls: [ './accordion.component.scss' ],\r\n      template: '...'\r\n    })\r\n    export class BsAccordionComponent { }\r\n\r\n    @Component({ selector: 'bs-accordion-tab' })\r\n    export class BsAccordionTabComponent { }\r\n\r\naccordion.component.scss\r\n\r\n```\r\n:host ::ng-deep {\r\n    // Configuration\r\n    @import \"~bootstrap/scss/functions\";\r\n    @import \"~bootstrap/scss/variables\";\r\n    @import \"~bootstrap/scss/mixins\";\r\n\r\n    // Layout & components\r\n    @import \"~bootstrap/scss/accordion\";\r\n\r\n    // Custom SCSS\r\n    bs-accordion {\r\n        margin: -1px;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`::ng-deep` is required for components that need to work together to make the styles work over all these components.\r\nHowever, using `::ng-deep` indicates that these styles cannot be bundled into the component.js. Because of this, angular will **now** create javascript chunks containing these styles, and bundle them in the main bundle, creating a massive main bundle with component styles that aren't really needed (in the case of a component library).\r\n\r\nAtm, we may as well just import `tailwind.css` or `boostrap.css` entirely, but this increases the initial bundle load, which is obviously something we need to avoid.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt would be really useful to support module-scoped `styleUrls`. This way we'd be able to have a module declaring multiple components\r\n\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [\r\n    BsAccordionComponent,\r\n    BsAccordionTabComponent,\r\n    BsAccordionTabHeaderComponent\r\n  ],\r\n  imports [ ... ],\r\n  styleUrls: [ './accordion.module.scss' ],\r\n})\r\nexport class BsAccordionModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way styles can be loaded when the module is being loaded, and would reduce initial load time of applications using component libraries.\r\n\r\nThis would require one of 2 things:\r\n1) An additional scope-attribute on the components declared by the module `...[_ngModule_c25]`\r\n2) Adding component tags to the selectors in the generated css (incremental complexity)\r\n\r\nI really hope you consider this. It doesn't seem really complex compared to the gains of module-scoped styles.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing directives as sub-components, but this isn't always possible.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<bs-accordion>\r\n  <div bsAccordionTab>...</div>\r\n  <div bsAccordionTab>...</div>\r\n</bs-accordion>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would still require the use of `::ng-deep`, and would only be an option if the sub-components don't contain complex logic.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48243","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Scoped styles per module\" (#48243)"},{"Id":"1465390049","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-27T10:04:04","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"48241","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove non-null assertions on common/http & common/directives ","State":"open","Body":"## PR Type\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n\r\nThese are fixes targeted to resolve #24571\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48241","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Remove non-null assertions on common/http & common/directives \" (#48241)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1467138419","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-28T21:51:11","Actor":"metaloha","Number":"24339","RawContent":null,"Title":"Browserslist unique for each project","State":"open","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nAn Angular project with some shared functionality between multiple front-end applications (ex. `./projects/full-client` and `./projects/lite-client`) currently needs to be built via lowest common denominator.

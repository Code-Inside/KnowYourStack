As a result this introduces a row of rendering bugs, depending on device, browser, zoom level, dpi etc.\r\n\r\n- The arrow does not look the same from column to column, changing appearance between columns\r\n- The arrow has lost its symmetrical form\r\n  - https://material.angular.io/components/sort/overview: ![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/60887273/0855a9f3-bca1-4abf-ba8b-90774606d6ed)\r\n  - Our case: ![image](https://github.com/angular/angular/assets/60887273/69ceebe9-427d-41eb-b9eb-300948df4172)\r\n- The arrow has a flat top or sometimes even holes where the two rectangles meet in rare cases, on a specific combination of browser, zoom level, dpi etc. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/sort/overview\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 16.2.10      \r\nNode: 21.5.0 (Unsupported)\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.3.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 16.2.12\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1602.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   16.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core            16.2.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      16.2.10\r\n@angular/cli                    16.2.10\r\n@schematics/angular             16.2.10\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\nzone.js                         0.13.3\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/53916","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"mat-table sort arrows are disproportionate and have rendering bugs\" (#53916)"},{"Id":"2080958781","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-14T23:22:33","Actor":"benb545","Number":"53915","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unexplained DOM Node accumulation and performance degradation in Angular 17 while routing between pages","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\r\n\r\nDon't known / other\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen navigating between my pages in my application using `this.router.navigate`, my DOM Nodes are increasing and the whole application eventually starts to slow down (Especially animations and transitions). \r\n\r\nThis happens mostly on Chrome, but also happens in Edge and Firefox but a lot better, takes more time to make it slow, or navigating between bigger pages with more elements.\r\n\r\nI have another app in the company that is a lot bigger than the app I write now with Angular 17, and is written with Angular 13 and has way more content and heavier pages, written very similar and this doesn't happen, nodes getting cleared eventually and nothing slows down.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to fix this, after long researching.\r\n\r\nI unsubscribe on destroys, I destroy unused components (actually it does it automatically on navigating), I use trackBy, I use a lot of ngIfs for skeleton loaders though, not sure if it can cause an issue.

the `signal()` functions.\r\n\r\n`signal<T>()` expects an argument and returns a `Signal<T>`, whereas `input<T>()` can be called with or without argument and returns a `Signal<T | undefined>` if no argument is passed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if we have code that uses `input()` without argument:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncollapsed = input<boolean>();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand want to pass it options, then suddenly we're forced to \r\n- pass an initial value, although the initial value is the same as before;\r\n- change the generic type passed to the function, even though the type of the signal to create is the same as before:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncollapsed = input<boolean | undefined>(undefined, { alias: 'appCollapsed' });\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nEven though it requires a bit more code, I find the the

I did not expect.\r\n\r\nI have a package in node_module that exports an enum like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n(function (MyEnum) {\r\n    MyEnum[\"A\"] = \"a\";\r\n    MyEnum[\"B\"] = \"b\";\r\n    MyEnum[\"C\"] = \"c\";\r\n})(MyEnum || (exports.MyEnum = MyEnum = {}));\r\n```\r\nI use it in my code like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {MyEnum} from '@my-package';\r\n\r\nconst MyEnumTitlesMap = new Map<MyEnum, string>([\r\n  [MyEnum.A, 'title for A'],\r\n  [MyEnum.B, 'title for B'],\r\n  [MyEnum.C, 'title for C'],\r\n]);\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-test',\r\n  templateUrl: './test.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./test.component.scss'],\r\n})\r\nexport class TestComponent {\r\n  ...\r\n  myMethod() {\r\n    const title = MyEnumTitlesMap.get(MyEnum.A)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTypescript recognizes the enum `MyEnum` but at runtime `MyEnum` is undefined. \r\n\r\nWhen I look a the generated bundle using @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser  as builder,  with `buildOptimized: true` the genrated bundle has \r\n```javascript\r\nvar MyEnum = /*#__PURE__*/(() => {\r\n  MyEnum = MyEnum || {};\r\n  MyEnum[\"A\"] = \"a\";\r\n  MyEnum[\"B\"] = \"b\";\r\n  MyEnum[\"C\"] = \"d\";\r\n  return MyEnum;\r\n})();\r\n```\r\nMyEnum is no longer exported, that's why at runtime it's undefined.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nI have spent 4 days trying to reproduce in a simple project but I couldn't.\r\nWhat I have is a commonJs package on npm registry which I install using yarn on my angular 16 project, the packag exports an enum which I can only use if It's inside the component for example a public property of the component and not in a const outside the component, in which case it gets tree shaken.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nBeing able to use the enum, and it wouldn't be tree-shaken.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nI have been unable to reproduce myself.\n\n###

In other frameworks like react the user is able to configure the postcss configs and therefore is able to use tool like [postcss-rtlcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-rtlcss)\r\n\r\nTo support the argument further, we can take a look at one of the most popular [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/rtl/) and their recommendation of using rtlcss \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAs we understand angular team would like to maintain exclusive control over the postcss configuration. We would like to see a similar implementation to the solution provided for tailwind by looking for a specific config file such as `rtlcss.config` and adding it to the list of postcss plugins if it exists.\r\n\r\nA similar approach on how angular handles the [tailwind plugin

considered\r\n\r\nCurrently we were relying on custom webpack overriding libraries such as [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus), however these are broken with the new build system and therefore it would be best if angular provide an official support for rtlcss plugin","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26867","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add

I also want to use WorkBox and not angular-serviceworker. This conflicts, for in order to compile my WorkBox template and inject built files into it it requires a second build step to be performed after angular has done emitting files to the output directory. I managed to get something like this working using a custom webpack configuration, but with angular 17 we are moving away from webpack and over to esbuild, and this customization is no longer available. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIn the angular.json config, a `serviceWorker` is either missing or declared as a pointer to an angular-serviceworker json config. \r\nI haven't thought this fully through yet, but something like the following config would be nice:\r\n```\r\n\"targets\": {\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"serviceWorker\": {\r\n        \"path\": \"./sw.ts\",\r\n        \"builder\": \"./path/to/buildScript.js\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe alternative is to give up HMR and `ng serve` completely, build angular first, then build and injectManifest into service worker and then run the entire project through a local http-server. This greatly reduces productivity.

See https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25434#issuecomment-1610298235 for more context.\r\n\r\nIf hiding the Jest configuration is a challenge for you, please consider if an alternative approach _without_ hooking into the Jest config is reasonable. Otherwise please post your use case to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25434 so we can evaluate the best path forward for this feature.\r\n\r\nJest was incorrectly picking up custom configurations, even though they exist outside Jest's root directory. This commit fixes that behavior so Jest does not see user configurations and does not apply them. Ideally we would throw an error if a Jest configuration is found to be more clear that it isn't doing what developers expect. However they may use a Jest config to run other projects in the same workspace outside of Angular CLI and we don't want to prevent that. A warning seems like the best trade off of notifying users that a custom config isn't supported while also not preventing unrelated Jest usage in the same workspace.\r\n\r\nI've noticed a few issues where users were using a custom config either causing a problem or attempting to solve one. I want to be up front during the experimentation process what our current stance is for users playing around with Jest so we can collect feedback on how it impacts users earlier.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/26852","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix: ignore custom Jest configuration file and warn if one is found\" (#26852)"},{"Id":"2076735056","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-11T14:15:17","Actor":"MattiJarvinen","Number":"26850","RawContent":null,"Title":"Multiple projects in Angular workspace don't get tested by running ng test without a project name","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\ntest\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\nIt's been a while but this is a documented feature... :(\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs per documentation https://angular.io/cli/test\r\n\r\nng test [project]\r\nng t [project]\r\n\r\nTakes the name of the project, as specified in the projects section of the angular.json workspace configuration file.

The problem is that each ripple registers itself with the `RippleEventManager` which needs to be notified on destroy so that it can dereference the DOM nodes and remove the event listeners.\r\n\r\nThese changes avoid the leaks by:\r\n1.

Fix issue where <mat-error/> does not render.\r\n\r\nExisting behavior is that _ErrorStateTracker sometimes reports error state as false when there is an error. This happens because Closure Compiler renames the _ErrorStateTracker's ErrorStateMatcher. The compiler renames all the other implementations of ErrorStateMatcher, but they have different names. Causes the matcher to be null in _ErrorStateTracker. Since ErrorStateMatcher is used as a class in some situations, Closure Compiler is not aware that it is intended to be the same type as the other implementations of ErrorStateMather.\r\n\r\nFix issue by declaring ErrorStateMatcher as an interface.

When I try to set it up in a stack blitz, the order of the two rules is reversed.

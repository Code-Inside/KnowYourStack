Without cache? This currently becomes reality for VDOM based frameworks like vue & react.\r\n\r\nWith angular it's not that easy, as the framework is basicly a compiler.\r\n\r\n# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\nFaster compiler.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPretty sure the angular team loves performance and compiler stuff. So I just wanna see what you think about this.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two typescript to javascript compilers in development:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild (written in go)\r\nhttps://github.com/swc-project/swc (written in rust)\r\n\r\nIn the wild:\r\nesbuild is used by [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) - maybe the next official bundler for vue 3\r\nswc is used by [deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) - a secure alternative to node.js, which natively understands typescript files\r\n\r\nThe performance is pretty remarkable. The performance gains are in the 100x ballpark. So if your typical webpack + loader written in javascript builds something in 50s, these two do the same in 500ms! So the current javascript based approaches clearly are bottlenecking in what V8 is capable of.\r\n\r\nWe switched our jest unit tests from ts-jest to swc-jest and the runtime went down from 50s to 11s - pretty much just the compute of executing the suite itself is left, the compile effort nearly disappears. Of course the tests run in JIT mode. If we had an angular compiler that fast, this could be even more swift.\r\n\r\nswc in particular may be interesting for angular, as the deno team right now tries to boost the typescript performance if they can just generate the AST via swc. Maybe you could do something similar. Get the AST from swc.\r\n\r\nOf course you are google. Maybe V8 just needs some optimizations for parsers. Sure thats not important for browser performance. But so much of the javascript tooling right now relies on V8. If rust or go can do the same task in a 1/100 of the time, there clearly seems to be some low hanging fruit.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38732","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feature request - faster compiler\" (#38732)"},{"Id":"694974720","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-07T10:48:13","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"38731","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): update CONSTS to DECLS","State":"open","Body":"This terminology was changed in d5b87d32b0fa50e978f1f148b48b1b9fc8134510\r\nbut a few instances were missed.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38731","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(core): update CONSTS to DECLS\" (#38731)"},{"Id":"694907480","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-07T09:26:22","Actor":"tirithen","Number":"38730","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make Angular componets exportable to Web Components by default","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe company I work for wants to reuse Angular custom UI components that is built by another team in a larger project I'm working in. The project I'm a part of uses standard web components with some basic helpers through lit-html/lit-element.\r\n\r\nIt seems that it's hard with Angular to use only a single component outside the Angular \"engine\". Does the Angular project have a roadmap on when the Angular components will be usable outside an all-in Angular app? It would probably help preventing large code re-writes as when AngularJS became Angular as web components using different helpers could then coexist, during migration as well as for the lifespan of a project. Much like the packages in the Node.js world where basically any package could be used separately from another.\r\n\r\nDo you have a roadmap for this, when would it be available? \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe possibility to export any pre-existing Angular component as a standard web component ([customElements.define](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define)) without internal custom modification.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAngular elements, it seems like great start for this approach, but as I understood when talking to the team developing the custom Angular components they would have to re-write the components to make it possible to export them.\r\n\r\nI understand that currently might be the case for a project that started without a thought on exporting their components, but what if the Angular API/syntax was designed as such that the default and only way to create the components was one where they could always be exported.\r\n\r\nSurely that would also help reduce the need for complete re-writes when the next major Angular release comes along as was the case from AngularJS to Angular.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38730","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make Angular componets exportable to Web Components by default\" (#38730)"},{"Id":"694704762","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-07T04:56:44","Actor":"wghglory","Number":"38729","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: word correction","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Most of the time this is fine, because the logic that escapes the rule content to `%BLOCK%` will have converted it to something that won't be matched by the regex. However, it breaks down for rules like `@import` which don't have a body, but can still have quoted content with characters that can match the regex.\r\n\r\nThese changes resolve the issue by making a second pass over the escaped string and replacing all of the remaining quoted content with `%QUOTED%` before parsing it with the regex. Once everything has been processed, we make a final pass where we restore the quoted content.\r\n\r\nIn a previous iteration of this PR, I went with a shorter approach which narrowed down the regex so that it doesn't capture rules without a body. It fixed the issue, but it also ended up breaking some of the more contrived unit test cases. I decided not to pursue it further, because we would've ended up with a very long and brittle regex that likely would've broken in even weirder\r\nways.\r\n\r\nFixes #38587.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38716","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): incorrectly encapsulating @import containing colons and semicolons\" (#38716)"},{"Id":"693442536","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-04T17:55:22","Actor":"acohenOT","Number":"38715","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove duplicate trans-unit element closing tag","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/postcss-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;400-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribpostcss-loadercomparev300v400-2020-09-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   minimum supported `Node.js` version is `10.13`\n-   minimum supported `webpack` version is `4`\n-   `postcss` was moved to `peerDependencies`, you need to install `postcss`\n-   `PostCSS` (`plugins`/`syntax`/`parser`/`stringifier`) options was moved to the `postcssOptions` option, please look at [docs](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader#postcssoptions)\n-   `sourceMap` default value depends on the `compiler.devtool` option\n-   the `inline` value was removed for the `sourceMap` option, please use `{ map: { inline: true, annotation: false } }` to achieve this\n-   source maps contain absolute paths in `sources`\n-   loader output only CSS, so you need to use `css-loader`/`file-loader`/`raw-loader` to inject code inside bundle\n-   `exec` option was renamed to the `execute` option\n-   the `config` option doesn't support `Object` type anymore, `config.path` and `config.ctx` options were removed\n-   argument in the config for `Function` notation (previously `config.ctx`) was changed, now it contains `{ file, mode, webpackLoaderContext }`\n-   loader context in the config was renamed from `webpack` to `webpackLoaderContext`\n\n##### Features\n\n-   message API for emit assets ([#&#8203;443](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/443)) ([e966ab9](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/e966ab965132ca812cb50e5eaf7df5fc2ad9c137))\n-   reuse AST from other loaders ([#&#8203;468](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/468)) ([9b75888](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/9b75888dff4957f2ef1e94eca871e329354a9f6d))\n-   allows to use config and loader options together, options from the loader takes precedence over the config, the `plugins` option from the config and options are merged ([0eb5aaf](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/0eb5aaf3d49f6d5e570a3c3fdb6b201487e503c7))\n-   `postcssOptions` options can be `Function`\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   compatibility with webpack@5 ([#&#8203;437](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/437)) ([ed50491](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/ed504910b70b4d8b4d77084c19ad92330676433e))\n-   `default` export for plugins ([#&#8203;465](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/465)) ([3d32c35](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/3d32c35c5c911d6bd25dc0c4b5b3cd11408632d7))\n-   avoid mutations of loader options and config ([#&#8203;470](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/470)) ([cad6f07](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/cad6f07c7f4923e8ef69ecb402b10bbd08d09530))\n-   respect the `map` option from loader options and config ([#&#8203;458](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/issues/458)) ([98441ff](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader/commit/98441ff87e51b58e9322d1bebb5eefc5ba417e24))\n\n##### Notes\n\n-   you don't need `ident` option for loader\n-   `Object` syntax for the `plugin` option is soft deprecated, please migrate on `Array` syntax (`plugins: ['postcss-present-env', ['cssnano', options]]`)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date:

Description\r\n\r\nIf you first create a component without importing the necessary modules, and then add these necessary modules, the component is not updated until you change the component itself.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this bug is Angular CLI, maybe it's more of an Angular Material bug.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n**Step 1**\r\n```bash\r\nng new my-project\r\ncd my-project\r\nng add @angular/material\r\n```\r\n**Step 2**\r\nIn `src/app/app.module.ts` import only `ReactiveFormsModule` and `MatFormFieldModule`:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\r\nimport { MatFormFieldModule } from '@angular/material/form-field';\r\n\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [\r\n    AppComponent\r\n  ],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BrowserModule,\r\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\r\n    ReactiveFormsModule,\r\n    MatFormFieldModule,\r\n  ],\r\n  providers: [],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule { }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 3**\r\nPut this code to `src/app/app.component.html`:\r\n```html\r\n<mat-form-field>\r\n  <input matInput>\r\n</mat-form-field>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 4**\r\n```bash\r\nng serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn console the browser see:\r\n```text\r\nERROR Error: mat-form-field must contain a MatFormFieldControl.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 5**\r\nImport `MatInputModule`:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { MatInputModule } from '@angular/material/input';\r\n// ...\r\nimports: [\r\n//..\r\n  MatInputModule\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the browser still:\r\n```text\r\nERROR Error: mat-form-field must contain a MatFormFieldControl.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 6**\r\n\r\nMake any change in `src/app/app.component.ts` and the error disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.8\r\nNode: 12.18.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.14\r\n... animations,

The new select is functionally identical to the current one since both are implemented on top of the same base class, but they have the following differences:\r\n* The logic that tries to position the selected option on top of the trigger has been removed from the MDC version. Now we only position the panel above or below, depending on the available space.\r\n* Since we don't have to deal with the panel positioning logic anymore, we can now allow the text of `mat-option` to wrap to multiple lines inside the MDC version.\r\n* The animations of the MDC version are simplified to mimic the ones from `mat-menu`, because the previous animations were tightly coupled to the old overlay positioning logic.\r\n\r\nAside from the new select, this PR includes the following fixes:\r\n* The `MatOptionSelectionChange.source` is now typed to the generic `_MatOptionBase` rather than the non-MDC implementation. This was an oversight when the base class was first implemented.\r\n* Uses `min-height` instead of `height` for the MDC `mat-option` in order to handle multi-line text better.\r\n* Adds the `mat-form-field-hide-placeholder`, `mat-form-field-appearance-outline` and `mat-form-field-appearance-fill` classes which were missing from the MDC form field. They're necessary so that the select can be styled to look correctly across all supported use cases.\r\n* The dev app for the select has been reorganized to emphasize `mat-select`, instead of `mat-form-field` with a native `select`. I've also cleaned up the styles so everything aligns better and is nicer to look at.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I'll add the test harness as a follow-up since the PR is fairly large already.\r\n\r\n![Angular_Material_-_Google_Chrome_2020-09-06_14-02-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4450522/92325575-33797500-f04c-11ea-86eb-b85469b6d91f.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/20502","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/mdc-select): implement MDC-based mat-select\" (#20502)"},{"Id":"694346285","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T11:33:20","Actor":"aimhighrana","Number":"20501","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://stackblitz.com/fork/components-issue\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. \r\n2. \r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/20501","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"bug(COMPONENT): TITLE\" (#20501)"},{"Id":"692414860","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T07:19:28","Actor":"jornfranke","Number":"20495","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(material): Angular 10 - Columns cannot be dragged and dropped in Material Table anymore","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI refactored and simplified some RxJS usage in the Router package in order to reduce its size and increase performance. Unfortunatelly, I'm not able to verify the package size because `node ./scripts/build/build-packages-dist.js` fails on my system for some reason.\r\n\r\nThe biggest changes are these:\r\n- I replaced all accurences of `first()` with `take(1)` because [without any parameter it's the same just `take(1)`](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/src/internal/operators/first.ts#L89-L91) (same with `last` and `takeLast()`).\r\n- Some custom operators were wrapped with another function even though they didn't need `source` Observable.\r\n- `from([x, y, z])` is the same as `of(x, y, z)` and using `of()` should be faster (I'll need to test this).\r\n\r\nThere are some other usecases that seem suspicious like using `from().pipe(mergeAll())` should be the same as using just `merge()` but I'll need to be able to run `build-packages-dist.js` to make sure it generates smaller package.\r\n\r\nBundle size `main-es2015` in `cli-hello-world-lazy-rollup` integration test dropped from expected `218507` to `217825`.\r\nBundle size `main-es2015` in `cli-hello-world-lazy` integration test dropped from expected `241837` to `241139`.\r\nSo both bundles are cca 700 B smaller.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the [removed records in `bundle.golden_symbols.json`](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40290/files#diff-0ea07045c567fb07c48994161c0a3bfa5bd1a676bc484d0fd8d3f9c5c2bc5d8d). It has probably something to do with this change https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40290/files#diff-1706bbbdd4dda445171e80023d67b54f1aa77a457d6b81b6815239113fd34decR62-R66 but I'm not sure why.\r\n\r\nI didn't make any change to existing tests because this should not break anything.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40290","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(router): refactor and simplify router RxJS chains\" (#40290)"},{"Id":"777097152","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-31T17:46:16","Actor":"HarshitChhipa","Number":"40288","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs:Corrected Some Spellings.","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For login we have used [@azure/msal-angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-angular) v1.0.0 plugin. After login we fetch 2 access tokens and store it in localStorage. One access token for normal app API and another for Microsoft Graph API where we fetch a members list from Azure Active Directory Group and use it in the app. We are using HttpClient from @angular/common/http package to make these API calls.\r\n\r\nAll the API calls works fine for desktop browsers but the problem is while sending the Graph API call https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/group-id/members from iPad browsers(tested in Safari, Chrome and Firefox), the headers are getting removed, so the access token is not passed resulting in 401 Unauthorized error. **This issue is happening exclusively for Graph API call in iPad browsers**.

After the upgrade we were able to start 3 other applications that are a little bit smaller than previously mentioned one.\r\n\r\nSince the error is quite unclear i started investigating what could be the cause and found only one issue report similar to this one here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/18792 \r\n\r\nBut that seemed to be an issue that was caused in their own setup. I also looked if we had anything similar, but with no luck. \r\n\r\nI also tried doing divide and conquer approach removing some modules from the application and that made it work. However there was no exact rule which modules work and which dont, the distribution was quite random expect one thing if i made the app smaller, then it worked(by removing bigger modules).\r\n\r\nNext on my list was to add some logging in `patchAliasReferenceResolutionOrDie` for the nodes that were being traversed and I did not see any circular dependency that would cause an infinite recursion.\r\n\r\nThen i tried adjusting the implementation of `isReferencedAliasDeclaration` and was able to make this work by changing this part here:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Before \r\nemitResolver.isReferencedAliasDeclaration = function(node, ...args) {\r\n    if (isAliasImportDeclaration(node) && referencedAliases.has(node)) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return originalReferenceResolution.call(emitResolver, node, ...args);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n// After \r\nemitResolver.isReferencedAliasDeclaration = function(node, checkChildren) {\r\n    if (isAliasImportDeclaration(node) && referencedAliases.has(node)) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return originalReferenceResolution.call(emitResolver, node, checkChildren);\r\n  };\r\n``` \r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/compiler-cli/src/transformers/patch_alias_reference_resolution.ts#L87\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change was made so that `isReferencedAliasDeclaration` looks exactly like the typescript implementation https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/microsoft/TypeScript@3eaa7c65f6f076a08a5f7f1946fd0df7c7430259/-/blob/src/compiler/checker.ts#L36179-36192 \r\n\r\nAnd this fixed the issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents on why this fixed it is better explained when looking at compiled code of the function\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Before\r\nemitResolver.isReferencedAliasDeclaration = function (node) {\r\n    var args = [];\r\n    for (var _i = 1, _len = arguments.length; _i < _len; _i++) {\r\n      args[_i - 1] = arguments[_i];\r\n    }\r\n    if (isAliasImportDeclaration(node) && referencedAliases.has(node)) {\r\n       return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return originalReferenceResolution.call.apply(originalReferenceResolution, tslib_1.__spread([emitResolver, node], args));\r\n};\r\n\r\n// After \r\nemitResolver.isReferencedAliasDeclaration = function (node, checkChildren) {\r\n    if (isAliasImportDeclaration(node) && referencedAliases.has(node)) {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return originalReferenceResolution.call(emitResolver, node, checkChildren);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring tree traversal `isReferencedAliasDeclaration` in each call is creating its own local array copying the arguments and then spreading that back again to original implementation, so i suppose after certain number of calls the memory just gets over allowed threshold and breaks. \r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is

Like this: \r\n```ts\r\nexport class TopBarComponent {\r\n  count = this.cart.getItems().length;\r\n  constructor(private cart: CartService) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```html\r\n<a routerLink=\"/cart\" class=\"button fancy-button\">\r\n  <i class=\"material-icons\">shopping_cart</i>\r\n  Checkout {{ count }}\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt won't work, because when we buy another item the change detection will not be triggered for that component, because Angular isn't listening to that value.  And here is where RxJS comes into play. \r\n\r\nWhat we can do is to introduce a `BehaviourSubject` in the cart service and explain it and the pros of using RxJS for this kind of use-cases.\r\nIt can be a simple pattern like this:  \r\n```ts\r\nexport class CartService {\r\n  private items = new BehaviorSubject<Product[]>([]);\r\n  items$ = this.items.asObservable().pipe(distinctUntilChanged());\r\n\r\n  cartCount$ = this.items$.pipe(map(items => items.length));\r\n\r\n  addToCart(product: Product): void {\r\n    const currentItems = this.items.value;\r\n    this.items.next([...currentItems, product]);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  clearCart(): void {\r\n    this.items.next([]);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand use it like this: \r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  ...\r\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\r\n})\r\nexport class TopBarComponent {\r\n  cartCount$ = this.cartService.cartCount$;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private cartService: CartService) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```html\r\n<a routerLink=\"/cart\" class=\"button fancy-button\">\r\n  <i class=\"material-icons\">shopping_cart</i>\r\n  Checkout ({{ cartCount$ | async }})\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also have created a repo with the app and it uses the RxJS functionalities to add reactivity to the app. [Try It App with RxJS.](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-hhwc8c?file=src/app/cart.service.ts)\r\n\r\nAlso, if this gets added, we can also introduce the dev to `async` pipe, `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` and Immutability","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/40275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Docs: Add 'Adding reactivity' section to 'Try It' in the 'Getting Started' guide\" (#40275)"},{"Id":"775613151","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-28T22:35:14","Actor":"atscott","Number":"40273","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: Add docs label to guide/example changes on aio","State":"open","Body":"The current configuration does not capture all possibilities for the docs label.\r\nThis change adds a group which applies the docs label for anything any changes\r\nto aio guides or examples.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40273","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: Add docs label to guide/example changes on aio\" (#40273)"},{"Id":"775606592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-28T22:10:48","Actor":"atscott","Number":"40272","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(router): Clarify how to clear secondary routes","State":"open","Body":"The example for clearing secondary outlets currently only works because\r\nthe named outlet appears at the root of the application's route config.\r\nIf developers follow this example with an outlet that is not at the\r\nroot level, they will not be able to close the outlet.\r\nThis commit updates the example to provide a more robust way\r\nof clearing the outlet from the activated outlet component\r\nas well as providing a warning about how the commands are applied.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is a small bit of guidance provided for developers who\r\nmight want to explore the ability to close an outlet from any location\r\nin the app, without needing to be aware of the activated route.\r\nAn example of this can be found here:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/close-outlet-from-anywhere\r\n\r\nresolves #13523\r\n\r\nQuestion to reviewers: \r\nI wonder if I should omit the last bit about closing the outlet using `navigateByUrl` because it goes beyond the common use-cases of just closing the outlet from either the parent that opened it or the activated child itself.\r\nIt's quite an advanced topic and complicated to explain but may still be something that devs want to do.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40272","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(router): Clarify how to clear secondary routes\" (#40272)"},{"Id":"775601637","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-28T21:53:14","Actor":"kucharzyk","Number":"40271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Strange behaviour with ngModel and looping over the array","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI've created simple input using ngFor and ngModel connected to array element.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n data = [\r\n   \"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\r\n   \"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",   \r\n ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input \r\n*ngFor=\"let el of data;let i = index\"\r\n[(ngModel)]=\"data[i]\"\r\ntype=\"text\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter focusing first input and typing one character:\r\n* input value changes\r\n* focus is lost and moves to next input\r\n* the following input value is set to previous input value\r\n* after typing another character whole text is copied to next input and it gain focus \r\n\r\nCan anyone explain this behaviour?

This error does not happen normally on these elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\nPull the repro from [here](https://github.com/tgoze/ng-build-optimizer-custom-web-el-repro). This is a base Angular 11 project with @microsoft/fast-components installed. The components are included as instructed on this [site](https://www.fast.design/docs/integrations/angular).\r\n\r\n### Normal behavior:\r\n1. Pull the repo\r\n2. Run `npm i`\r\n3. Run `npm start`\r\n4. Open localhost:4200\r\n5. See a simple textbox and radio button rendered and no console errors\r\n\r\n### Reproduce error:\r\n1. Run `npm start-prod`\r\n2. Open localhost:5005\r\n3. Observe the console error and the radio button un-rendered\r\n\r\nIf `buildOptimizer` in angular.json for the production mode is set to `false` the error will not occur for `npm start-prod`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here:

The old name\n    remains, but is now deprecated.\n\n-   Rename `SassNumber.coerceValueToUnit()`, a shorthand for\n    `SassNumber.coerceValue()` that takes a single numerator unit.\n\n-   Add `SassNumber.coerceToMatch()` and `SassNumber.coerceValueToMatch()`, which\n    work like `SassNumber.coerce()` and `SassNumber.coerceValue()` but take a\n    `SassNumber` whose units should be matched rather than taking the units\n    explicitly. These generate better error messages than `SassNumber.coerce()`\n    and `SassNumber.coerceValue()`.\n\n-   Add `SassNumber.convertToMatch()` and `SassNumber.convertValueToMatch()`,\n    which work like `SassNumber.coerceToMatch()` and\n    `SassNumber.coerceValueToMatch()` except they throw exceptions when converting\n    unitless values to or from units.\n\n-   Add `SassNumber.compatibleWithUnit()`, which returns whether the number can be\n    coerced to a single numerator unit.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The reason is when using Angular CLI there is no way of including `ng-annotate` as part of the pipeline for the AngularJs bits.\r\n\r\nWhat is the 2021 way of using ng-annotate for hybrid applications?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI would like a \"plugins\" section where I could specify \"ng-annotate\" and only for files that match a regex (the AngularJs files).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI've considered:\r\n1. **Ejecting the configuration and not using ng-cli.** I don't like this solution as I want to use Angular CLI and reduce customizations (so upcoming upgrades are smoother).\r\n1. **Running ng-annotate on each of the Angular files by hand, and permanently replacing the original files.** But it's rather involved, I'd need to write a script that:\r\n    - Removes the imports from the top of my files (because ng-annotate doesn't like \"imports/exports\" in non-module files).\r\n    - Runs ng-annotate in each one, redirecting the output to a file, then swapping the files.\r\n1. **Continuing to use the non-optimized version of my product in production**. My company's product is quite large, and it is taking several seconds to download and bootstrap, so this is exactly what I want to avoid.\r\n1. **Using a custom webpack config prepended to ng-cli's one.** I found it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59302237/how-to-use-ng-annotate-with-hybrid-app-based-on-angular-cli).\r\n\r\nSo far it looks like number 4 is what I'm going to try, otherwise doing number 2.

This is not possible using current api state.

-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/common/http\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\n### TLDR:\r\nA boolean as body is seen as `text/plain` where is should be seen as `application/json`, since it is valid JSON, like numbers. See:\r\nhttps://jsonlint.com/\r\nhttps://www.json.org/json-en.html\r\n\r\n### Detailed description:\r\nThe `post()` method of `HttpClient` (and other request methods) accept a body method argument of type `any`. When the HTTP request is about to execute, `HttpClient` will determine the content type of `body`, so that it can set the `Content-Type` header to for example `application/json` or `text/plain`.\r\n\r\nWhen an object is used as `body`, HttpClient will send it as `application/json` as expected.\r\n\r\nWhen a plain number is used as `body` (e.g. `123`, without quotes), HttpClient will also send it as `application/json`, because even a plain number (without curly braces and without quotes) is valid JSON.\r\n\r\nWhen a TypeScript string is used as `body` argument (e.g. `\"abc\"`), HttpClient will send it as `text/plain` because it will be send without quotes in the HTTP request body, and thus isn't valid JSON. So it will use `text/plain` as expected.\r\n\r\nBut when boolean is used, this behavior is different. When a plain boolean (e.g. `true`) is used as `body` argument, HttpClient will send it as `text/plain` even though a simple plain boolean is valid JSON.\r\n\r\nThe code where this problems is caused is:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/2686219fcee938fbb4359aa6318ffd97f91b0240/packages/common/http/src/request.ts#L295\r\n\r\n```\r\n    // Arrays, objects, and numbers will be encoded as JSON.\r\n    if (typeof this.body === 'object' || typeof this.body === 'number' || Array.isArray(this.body)) {\r\n      return 'application/json';\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlain objects, numbers, booleans and arrays values are all [valid JSON code](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). Whereas a plain string without quotes it not valid JSON.\r\nSo plain objects, numbers, booleans and arrays values should be send as `application/json` and strings as `text/plain`. But in HttpClient this behavior unexpectedly differs for booleans.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-umexba?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, VERSION } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <button (click)=\"sendObject()\">Send object</button>\r\n    <button (click)=\"sendNumber()\">Send number</button>\r\n    <button (click)=\"sendBoolean()\">Send boolean</button>\r\n    <button (click)=\"sendString()\">Send string</button>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent  {\r\n  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n  sendObject() {\r\n    // 'application/json'\r\n    this.httpClient.post<any>(\"http://localhost\", {x: 1}).subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sendNumber() {\r\n    // 'application/json'\r\n    this.httpClient.post<any>(\"http://localhost\", 123).subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sendBoolean() {\r\n    // `text/plain`, but should be 'application/json'\r\n    this.httpClient.post<any>(\"http://localhost\", true).subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sendString() {\r\n    // `text/plain`\r\n    this.httpClient.post<any>(\"http://localhost\", \"abc\").subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre>10.1.2</pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38924","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpClient - incorrect ContentType for boolean\" (#38924)"},{"Id":"705801305","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-21T17:55:17","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"38922","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): update docs examples to Angular v10 (and related changes)","State":"open","Body":"WIP","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38922","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(docs-infra): update docs examples to Angular v10 (and related changes)\" (#38922)"},{"Id":"705767538","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-21T17:00:37","Actor":"adrianlafond","Number":"38921","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng-content API docs are missing","State":"open","Body":"# üìö Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNo API page for `ng-content` exists. `ng-content` is mentioned on several pages, almost in passing (eg, https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks), but searching brings up no dedicated page with API info.

The service worker was integrated following [this guide](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started). Because of the fact that *any* request is passed through the security gateway we had to provide additional options to the construction of any `Request` object, namely `credentials` and `mode`, when a service worker is requesting its manifest from the server. Otherwise manifest fetch fails with CORS error:\r\n\r\n> No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\r\n\r\n### Desired behavior\r\nIf I could use the `ngsw-config.json` file, or some other means of configuration, to set some global options which in return are applied to any fetch request.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nReactive Forms are currently not strongly typed. This leads to a suboptimal developer experience and does not catch common mistakes (e.g. typos).\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #13721\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThere are (/have been) multiple attempts to make FormArray, FormControl and FormGroup type safe. My proposal is different compared to the already existing ones: Instead of directly making these three classes type safe, I have introduced three new classes: StrictFormArray, StrictFormControl and StrictFormGroup (inheriting from their non-strict variants).  \r\nDevelopers have to define a separate \"form model\" that describes the structure of the form. Once this has been done, you get lots of benefits, including support for code suggestions/autocompletion, warnings when accessing non-existing controls, etc.\r\n\r\nBenefits compared to other approaches:\r\n- Guaranteed not to be a breaking change\r\n- Developers can gradually migrate to this optional API\r\n- StrictFormControls can still hold objects and not only primitive values\r\n\r\nDrawbacks:\r\n- Developers need to define a separate form model, so they have to type more (pun intended)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI was running the tests on a pretty slow computer, so many just timed out (`FirefoxHeadless failed 2 times (timeout). Giving up.`) Hoping for CI to provide the results.\r\n\r\nSince my PR basically only includes a new model, I did not know if I had to create new tests. If so, I would be happy about a small explanation/example on how these tests should look like. My thoughts: I am literally only forwarding calls to the super classes, so there isn't be much that could break.\r\n\r\n(And one small thing: Most of the examples from the docs are based on ones of the respective non-strict version.)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38906","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): add strict reactive forms api\" (#38906)"},{"Id":"704863846","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-19T11:20:54","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"38905","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(docs-infra): add unit tests for rxjs examples","State":"open","Body":"This commit adds missing unit tests for all rxjs examples from the docs.\r\n\r\nCloses #28017\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38905","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test(docs-infra): add unit tests for rxjs examples\" (#38905)"},{"Id":"704804862","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-19T05:14:10","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"38904","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(zone.js): monkey patches queueMicrotask()","State":"open","Body":"Close #38863\r\n\r\nMonkey patches `queueMicrotask()` API, so the callback runs in the zone\r\nwhen scheduled, and also the task is run as `microTask`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nZone.current.fork({\r\n  name: 'queueMicrotask',\r\n  onScheduleTask: (delegate: ZoneDelegate, curr: Zone, target: Zone, task: Task) => {\r\n    logs.push(task.type);\r\n    logs.push(task.source);\r\n    return delegate.scheduleTask(target, task);\r\n  }\r\n}).run(() => {\r\n    queueMicrotask(() => {\r\n      expect(logs).toEqual(['microTask', 'queueMicrotask']);\r\n      expect(Zone.current.name).toEqual('queueMicrotask');\r\n      done();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38904","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(zone.js): monkey patches queueMicrotask()\" (#38904)"},{"Id":"704596568","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-18T23:55:58","Actor":"atscott","Number":"38902","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler): refactor ast spans test to be more human readable","State":"closed","Body":"The current tests print out the span numbers, which are really difficult to verify\r\nsince it requires manually going to the template string and looking at what\r\ncharacters appear within those indexes.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community.

All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For instance, getting the 8.0 release ready took [4 months of work](https://twitter.com/PostCSS/status/1273368785592999936).\n\nThis release was possible thanks to out community. [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), [**De Voorhoede**](https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/), [**InVision AG**](https://www.ivx.com/), [**Brainbow**](https://opencollective.com/brnbw), and [many individual contributions](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://refactoringui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tailwind-logo.svg\"\n       alt=\"Sponsored by Tailwind CSS\" width=\"273\" height=\"64\">\n</a>\n\nIf your company wants to support the sustainability of front-end infrastructure or just wants to give some love to PostCSS, you can join our supporters by:\n\n-   [**Tidelift**](https://tidelift.com/) with a Spotify-like subscription model and supporting all projects from your lock file.\n-   Direct donations in [**PostCSS & Autoprefixer Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/postcss#section-contributors).\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nWe try to avoid any breaking changes for end-users:\n\n-   PostCSS 8 dropped **Node.js 6.x, 8.x, 11.x, and 13.x** versions support. All these versions have no security updates anymore.\n-   We now serve ES6+ sources in the npm package **without Babel** compilation. If you are creating tools like CodePen and put PostCSS into the client-side JS bundle, you may need to run Babel on `node_modules/postcss` for old browsers.\n-   We removed rarely used `postcss.vendor` API.\n\n#### New Plugin API\n\nThe biggest change in PostCSS 8 is a new plugin API. Thanks to [@&#8203;BondarenkoAlex](https://togithub.com/BondarenkoAlex) for big help in creating a new API.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = () => {\n  return {\n    postcssPlugin: 'postcss-will-change',\n    Declaration: {\n      'will-change': (decl, { Declaration }) => {\n        decl.cloneBefore(\n          new Declaration({ prop: 'backface-visibility', value: 'hidden' })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.postcss = true\n```\n\nWe know that rewriting old plugins will take time, but the new API will improve the end-user‚Äôs experience and make life easier for plugin developers:\n\n-   With new API, all plugins can share a single scan of the CSS tree. It makes CSS processing up to **20% faster**.\n-   Because npm often duplicates dependencies, you may have many `postcss` duplicates in your `node_modules`. New API fixes this problem.\n-   Plugins will re-visit changed nodes to **reduce compatibility issues** between plugins. Now the order of plugins in your PostCSS config will be less important.\n-   New API is close to Babel‚Äôs visitor API.\n\nThese resources will help plugin developers in API migration:\n\n-   [**The Migration Guide**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/postcss-8-plugin-migration)\n-   [**Writing a PostCSS Plugin**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/writing-a-plugin.md)\n-   We have a [**Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) open for all questions related to plugin migration.\n\nPostCSS development guidelines were also changed:\n\n-   Now it is prohibited to create own AST on top of PostCSS AST classes since it could lead to [painful bugs](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1305) due to the usage private APIs.\n-   Plugins and runners must have `postcss` in `peerDependencies`.\n\n#### New Website without React\n\nPreviously PostCSS used [a React-based framework](https://togithub.com/phenomic/phenomic) for the project's website. Since we have a static website, we decided to migrate to a React-free framework and got good performance improvements:\n\n-   **360 ‚Üí 20** ms for Max Potential First Input Delay\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for First CPU Idle\n-   **3.3 ‚Üí 1.5** seconds for Time to Interactive\n\nCheck out [**postcss.org**](https://postcss.org/) and [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/) that feature the awesome alchemy-inspired design by [@&#8203;okonet](https://togithub.com/okonet).\n\n<a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/92683881-153c9f00-f302-11ea-8355-e61d0f02776e.jpeg\" alt=\"PostCSS website performance results\" />\n</a>\n\nWe also removed Google Analytics tracking scripts and encourage other open source projects to be an example in caring about user‚Äôs privacy and performance.\n\n#### Parser Improvments\n\nDid you know that all examples below are valid CSS?\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --empty: ;\n  --JSON: [1, \"2\", {\"three\": {\"a\":1}}, [4]];\n  --javascript: function(rule) { console.log(rule) };\n}\n\n@&#8203;supports (--element(\".minwidth\", { \"minWidth\": 300 })) {\n  [--self] {\n    background: greenyellow;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow PostCSS parses even those rare edge cases correctly. Thanks to Tailwind CSS and Prettier teams for adding more cases to our [CSS parser tests collection](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss-parser-tests/).\n\nNote that now `--roundMixin: { border-radius: 8px }` will be parsed as a `Declaration` with the `{ border-radius: 8px }` value.\n\n#### Better Source Map Support\n\nWe have added support for two new source map formats: [**Index map**](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html#h.535es3xeprgt) and [**JSON**](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1371) (`data:application/json`).\n\nPostCSS 8 is now much closer to the source map spec. Thanks to the Google team for reports:\n\n-   We now [treat](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1347) `sources` in map **as URLs** instead of file paths.\n-   We now [resolve](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1348) `sources` **relative to map file**, not CSS file.\n\nA few source map APIs were added:\n\n-   `opts.maps.absolute = true` option for [absolute paths](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1352) in source map.\n-   `opts.maps.annotation = (file, root) => url` for a [dynamic path](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1324) to source map.\n-   `Node#origin()` now returns `position.url` in addition to `position.file` for compatibility with absolute URLs in source map‚Äôs `sources`.\n\n#### API Changes\n\nWe have added **ES modules** support and now we **export all classes** from the main entry:\n\n```js\nimport { CssSyntaxError, parse } from \"postcss\"\n```\n\n[@&#8203;graberzz](https://togithub.com/graberzz) added [`Node#source.offset`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1325) in addition to `line` and `column`.\n\nCSS Custom Properties and Sass-like `$`-variables now have a special `Declaration#variable` mark:\n\n```js\nconst root = parse(`\n  :root {\n    --propery: value;\n  }\n  $variable: value\n`)\n\nroot.first.first.variable //=> true\nroot.last.variable //=> true\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nPostCSS now has a first-class TypeScript support:\n\n-   We moved API docs from JSDoc to [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/). Check out our [**new API docs**](https://postcss.org/api/).\n-   We are using [**check-dts**](https://togithub.com/ai/check-dts) to test types with [special unit tests](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/test/errors.ts).\n-   We keep types in separate files for better readability.\n-   With the new structure and test system, we fixed many small issues in types.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   [Fixed calling `replaceWith`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1368) with input replaced node (by [@&#8203;josephkaptur](https://togithub.com/josephkaptur)).\n-   Reduce dependencies by replacing `chalk` to [`colorette`](https://togithub.com/jorgebucaran/colorette).\n-   Added `Declaration#value` [auto-conversion](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/issues/1373) to string to prevent plugin‚Äôs bugs.\n-   Fixed building PostCSS with Rollup (by [@&#8203;MapGrid](https://togithub.com/MapGrid)) because of [circular dependencies](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/pull/1321).\n-   Moved unknown source from counter to random IDs: `<input css 9M4X8l>:10:6`.\n-   Removed docs from the npm package.\n\n### [`v7.0.34`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7034)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.33...7.0.34)\n\n-   Fix compatibility with `postcss-scss` 2.\n\n### [`v7.0.33`](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;7033)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/postcss/compare/7.0.32...7.0.33)\n\n-   Add error message for PostCSS 8 plugins.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

[`v2.0.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-sources/releases/v2.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack-sources/compare/v1.4.3...v2.0.0)\n\n### API\n\n#### Additions\n\n-   add `buffer` method to Source\n-   add SizeOnlySource\n-   expose everything needed for serialization as public methods\n-   add `CompatSource`\n-   add support for a lazy function as original Source for CachedSource\n\n#### Removals\n\n-   remove node and listNode methods from public API\n-   remove LineToLineMappedSource\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   ConcatSource falls back to sourceAndMap when node() or listMap() is not available\n-   PrefixSource do no longer insert prefix in the middle of the line in some cases\n-   fix updateHash for SourceMapSource\n-   fix crash when Source in CachedSource returns null map\n\n### Performance:\n\n-   avoid unnecessary sorting in ReplaceSource\n-   make exports lazy\n-   cache utf-8 conversion\n-   allow keeping Buffer instead of string and only convert it lazily\n-   add optimization step to ConcatSource which converts strings to RawSources (which cache)\n-   cache Buffers instead of string in CachedSource cache for `map()`\n\n### Changes\n\n-   increase minimum node.js version to 10.13\n\n### Other\n\n-   add Source types to hash\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am

The structural styles are close to what we have in the current paginator, while the theming and typography are implemented on top of MDC's mixins. Furthermore, we're using the MDC versions of `mat-select` and `mat-button` inside the paginator.\r\n\r\nThere are the following gotchas in this implementation:\r\n1. The `mat-form-field` inside the paginator is set to always use the densest layout possible. This is necessary, because the MDC form field is too tall by default.\r\n2. We hide one internal element from the form field, because it throws off the vertical alignment and is only used for hints and error messages which the paginator doesn't have.\r\n3. I had to duplicate the `MatPaginatorDefaultOptions` interface, because the appearance of the MDC form field doesn't support the `legacy` and `standard` values.\r\n\r\n**Note:** doesn't include a test harness, because it depends on #20603.

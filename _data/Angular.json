However this argument allows a selector or element incompatible with the selector of the root component.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component, ElementRef, inject } from '@angular/core';\nimport { createApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: `\n    <!-- Expect this to always be `app-root`. -->\n    <div>My tag name is: <code>{{ tagName }}</code>.</div>\n  `,\n})\nexport class App {\n  private readonly elementRef = inject(ElementRef);\n  protected readonly tagName =\n    this.elementRef.nativeElement.tagName.toLowerCase();\n}\n\n(async () => {\n  const root = document.createElement('definitely-not-an-app-root');\n  document.body.append(child);\n\n  const appRef = await createApplication();\n  appRef.bootstrap(App, root);\n})();\n```\n\nThis works and renders the application into the provided root element, but is also confusing and unexpected that `App` is rendering to a different element than its selector specifies. This makes it easy to accidentally bootstrap an application on the wrong element and I think it breaks the expected invariants of `App`.\n\nThe same issues applies with `createComponent` and its `hostElement` property.\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hwtnadeo?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThrow an error when rendering a component to an element with an incompatible selector.\n\nThis goes beyond just tag names, as a component might use attributes or any other syntax in its selector. Ultimately whatever element is provided just needs to match the provided selector. Directives should also receive the same check, though I think that would be harder to abuse.\n\nWe can certainly limit this to `ngDevMode` to avoid depending on a runtime representation of the `selector` in production, which I think would be fine.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe can consider that it is actually acceptable for a component to be rendered to an element incompatible with its selector and ignore any complexity or confusion which arises from this.\n\nI don't think it's major problem in urgent need of a fix, but I don't see any valid use case for keeping it around.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/63554","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Components should throw when rendered to incompatible selectors\" (#63554)"},{"Id":"3374416334","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-02T17:10:23","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"63540","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update github/codeql-action action to v3.30.0 (20.2.x)","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [github/codeql-action](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action) | action | minor | `v3.29.11` -> `v3.30.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>github/codeql-action (github/codeql-action)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.30.0`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v3.30.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v3.29.11...v3.30.0)\n\n### CodeQL Action Changelog\n\nSee the [releases page](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases) for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.\n\n#### 3.30.0 - 01 Sep 2025\n\nNo user facing changes.\n\nSee the full [CHANGELOG.md](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/v3.30.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

URI to render its dotted buffer animation via a background-image style. \nThis is a change from Angular Material v14, where the SVG was injected directly into the DOM.\nWhile the SVG itself is static and safe, this implementation forces developers who use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to enable img-src data:, [which is widely considered a security risk as it opens a potential vector for XSS attacks](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#:~:text=In%20either%20case%2C%20developers%20SHOULD,they%20are%20best%20avoided%20completely.): \"(...)developers SHOULD NOT include (...) data: as valid sources in their policies.\"\nContent Secruity Policy does not allow to be specific to allow only one particular data: URI.\n\nI tried to generate a sha256 from the SVG based on what is output in the Google Chrome console : \n```\nRefused to load the image 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' x='0px' y='0px' enable-background='new 0 0 5 2' xml:space='preserve' viewBox='0 0 5 2' preserveAspectRatio='xMinYMin slice'%3E%3Ccircle cx='1' cy='1' r='1'/%3E%3C/svg%3E' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"img-src 'self' 'sha256-w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g=' https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.googletagmanager.com\".\n```\n`w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g=` is the sha256 I get with this script :\n``` bash\necho -n \"<svg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' x='0px' y='0px' enable-background='new 0 0 5 2' xml:space='preserve' viewBox='0 0 5 2' preserveAspectRatio='xMinYMin slice'><circle cx='1' cy='1' r='1'/></svg>\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64\n```\nMy CSP image source looks like to `img-src 'self' 'sha256-w6m3g59F/ECbFbkAT4tMCzZ06TdY+u9MjSbNwZy1T3g='` and the error is still raising.\nDebuging this is very time-consuming.\n\nThis is a significant regression from the v14 behavior, which was CSP-friendly out-of-the-box.\n\nProposed Solution / Suggestion:\n1. Please consider reverting to the previous implementation of injecting the SVG directly into the DOM.\n2. Providing an alternative mechanism that does not rely on data: URIs for styling. \n\nThis would greatly simplify CSP implementation for security-conscious applications. Thank you!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create an Angular application with a strict Content Security Policy that does not include img-src data:. For example: img-src 'self';.\n2. Use the <mat-progress-bar mode=\"buffer\"></mat-progress-bar> component.\n3. Observe the browser console for CSP errors related to a blocked data: URI.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe mat-progress-bar component should render without violating a strict CSP that disallows data: URIs for images. The v14 approach of injecting an inline element into the DOM was ideal, as it did not require any changes to img-src.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe component attempts to load a background-image with a data: URI, violating the CSP and preventing the buffer animation from rendering.\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.1.7\n- CDK/Material: 20.1.6\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): TuxedoOS (Ubuntu 24.04 based) and Windows 10\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31808","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-progress-bar): Use of `data:` URI for buffer SVG is a regression that complicates strict CSP implementation\" (#31808)"},{"Id":"3368834055","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-30T07:03:28","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"31807","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: generate more believable token examples","State":"open","Body":"Currently we generate the token examples by taking the first two tokens and using a static value for them.

This causes the two distinct `02:00` times (DST vs standard) on the fallback day to collapse into one — selecting the non-DST `02:00` ends up mapped to the DST `02:00`.\n\n### Custom DateAdapter:\nTo ensure consistent Luxon `DateTime` handling, I replaced the default `LuxonDateAdapter` with a custom one.\n\n```\n@Injectable()\nexport class CustomDateAdapter extends LuxonDateAdapter {\n  protected override locale = DateTimeService.LOCALE;\n\n  constructor() {\n    super(DATE_FORMATS);\n  }\n\n  /** Ensure datepicker provides Luxon DateTimes in the default zone */\n  public override createDate(year: number, month: number, date: number): DateTime {\n    return super.createDate(year, month, date)\n      .setZone(DateTimeService.DEFAULT_ZONE)\n      .setLocale(DateTimeService.LOCALE);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Needed so the timepicker does not treat DST and non-DST versions of the same wall time as equal.\n   * Without this, both values are considered the same and the DST one always “wins”.\n   */\n  public override sameTime(first: DateTime | null, second: DateTime | null): boolean {\n    if (!isDefined(first) || !isDefined(second)) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    return +first === +second;\n  }\n\n  public override clone(date: DateTime): DateTime {\n    let cloned = super.clone(date);\n    cloned = cloned.setZone(DateTimeService.DEFAULT_ZONE);\n    cloned = cloned.setLocale(DateTimeService.LOCALE);\n    return cloned;\n  }\n}\n´´´\n\nDespite these adjustments, the underlying `_assignUserSelection` logic in the timepicker still collapses the two 02:00 times into one, because of how it uses the last valid date + setTime.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-fyaws5vk\nSteps to reproduce:\n* Use the custom CustomDateAdapter (above) instead of the default LuxonDateAdapter.\nOn the DST end day ( 2025-10-26), try selecting both 02:00 (DST) and 02:00 (STD).\n* Observe that selecting the 02:00 (STD) still results in the 02:00 (DST) value being applied (or both depending on Custom vs LuxonDateAdapter).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n* The timepicker should treat 02:00 DST and 02:00 STD as distinct values when using a fixed timezone.\n* Selecting the standard-time 02:00 should not be coerced into the DST-time 02:00.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n* Because `_assignUserSelection` rebuilds the target date and applies extracted hours, the ambiguous hour is resolved to the earlier offset (DST).\n* Even with a custom adapter that distinguishes times (`sameTime` override), the timepicker ends up normalizing both selections to the DST instance.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 20.2\n- CDK/Material: 20.2\n- Browser(s): Chrome, ...\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n\n- Custom DateAdapter: subclass of LuxonDateAdapter (see above)\n- Timezone: Europe/Vienna\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(timepicker): Timepicker DST edge case: incorrect hour mapping with fixed timezone + custom Luxon adapter\" (#31803)"},{"Id":"3364051758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T17:01:37","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31802","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): separate interaction from toolbar and radio group","State":"open","Body":"WIP: fixing tests\r\n\r\n--\r\nThis change makes composite patterns work in a natural data-down flow with no more circular dependencies.\r\n\r\nProblems with current implementation\r\n- Toolbar and Radio Group are strongly coupled, each patterns contain complex conditional logics when each other pattern exists to handle event listener conflicts.\r\n- This also creates circular dependencies, and there are many `...Like` interfaces created as a workaround.\r\n- Not future proof. The above two problems will grow exponentially if a pattern needs to support multiple composite patterns.\r\n\r\nWith this refactoring\r\n- Event handlers are pulled out from patterns, and instead patterns provide actions of what they are capable to do.\r\n- Radio Group supports two sets of actions - as regular radio group and as a sub group in a toolbar.\r\n- Toolbar supports a new child pattern - Widget Group, which will treat everything inside as a blackbox. What it does is passing down the interactions from Toolbar, and whatever in the blackbox should handle those interactions.\r\n- Now the control-flow becomes clear\r\n  - On the top level, Toolbar-Interaction converts keyboard/pointer events into available Toolbar actions\r\n  - Widget and Widget Groups are both list items. If the current `activeItem` is a Widget Group, then keep passing down the Toolbar action.\r\n  - Whatever inside the Widget Group(in this case it's Radio Group) takes the instructions from Widget Group and handle the interactions by themselves.\r\n\r\nAs a result\r\n- This solves event handler conflicts in a composite pattern as patterns no longer need to bind their event handlers to a DOM.\r\n- Composite pattern parent no longer need to know what children patterns they are controlling. They only need to pass down instructions, and children patterns should implement their interop layer to handle those instructions, and return necessary information to the parent. Very typical Data Down Action Up style.\r\n- This approach also enables the potential of supporting non-Angular Aria library components, for example, as long as Material Radio Group can act on instructions sent from Widget Group, then it can be used within the Angular Aria Toolbar, without having to tweak anything inside the Toolbar. It can't be done with the current implementation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31802","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(cdk-experimental/ui-patterns): separate interaction from toolbar and radio group\" (#31802)"},{"Id":"3362104721","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T07:20:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"31798","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: define typescript version via string in module.bazel file","State":"closed","Body":"Within our module.bazel file when describing the version of typescript to use for rules_ts, we use ts_version instead of ts_version_from to prevent our package.json file from being part of the set of files used to calculate the sha for the lock file.

This obsoletes the `mixed-decls` deprecation.\n\n- **Breaking change:** The function name `type()` is now fully reserved for the\n  plain CSS function. This means that `@function` definitions with the name\n  `type` will produce errors, while function calls will be parsed as special\n  function strings.\n\n- Configuring private variables using `@use ... with`, `@forward ... with`, and\n  `meta.load-css(..., $with: ...)` is now deprecated. Private variables were\n  always intended to be fully encapsulated within the module that defines them,\n  and this helps enforce that encapsulation.\n\n- Fix a bug where `@extend` rules loaded through a mixture of `@import` and\n  `@use` rules could fail to apply correctly.\n\n##### Command-Line Interface\n\n- In `--watch` mode, delete the source map when the associated source file is\n  deleted.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

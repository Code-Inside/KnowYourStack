I’m not sure which part of the setup is causing the problem, or if the issue lies within my code. However, the behavior varies depending on the approach used to bind the data.\r\n\r\nIn my component, different HTML tags are rendered based on the status, which can be one of three values: loading, updating, or finished.\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn the provided [StackBlitz reproduction](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qabqoy?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fstatus%2Fbroken-status.component.ts), you can observe three variations of the component:\r\n\r\n1. Good Component: Uses a signal to store the observable value emitted from the store status selector. This implementation works correctly.\r\n2. Broken Component: Uses the store status selector with the async pipe in the template, combined with @defer blocks. Occasionally, the component fails to update, particularly when the updating state is triggered.\r\n3. Just Status Component: Uses the store status selector with the async pipe in the template, but only renders the status without using @defer. This version works as expected, which indicates that the store selector itself is functioning properly.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nWhen testing, you may notice that sometimes the updating state fails to render in the Broken Component. This behavior occurs sporadically, and can be observed by refreshing the StackBlitz project.\r\n## What I've Tried\r\n\r\n1. Change Detection (markForCheck): Called markForCheck on the pipe inside the selector, but it didn’t resolve the issue.\r\n2. Change Detection (detectChanges): Explicitly invoked detectChanges in the pipe inside the selector, but no improvement.\r\n3. Member Variable for Status: Substituted signal with a member variable to store the status and updated it via a subscription to the selector. This also failed to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n    Angular CLI 18.1.0\r\n    Node 18.20.3\r\n    Chrome (fails sometimes)\r\n    Firefox (fails always)\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe component should consistently update the template based on the emitted status, regardless of the rendering mechanism or how the data is bound.\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe component intermittently fails to render certain states (e.g., updating) when using the async pipe combined with @defer. However, this behavior is absent when using signal or when not using the @defer directive.\r\n\r\n[Reproduction Project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qabqoy?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fstatus%2Fbroken-status.component.ts)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qabqoy?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fstatus%2Fbroken-status.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n```true\r\nThe UI occasionally does not update.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI 18.1.0\r\nNode 18.20.3\r\nChrome (fails sometimes)\r\nFirefox (fails always)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57954","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Template update failure with async pipe, signal inputs, store selectors, and @defer directive\" (#57954)"},{"Id":"2548105388","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-25T14:07:46","Actor":"paulnaber","Number":"57955","RawContent":null,"Title":"DeepSignal Inputs and Models","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, Angular's signal-based inputs and models work well for primitive types, but they become cumbersome when dealing with complex objects. This feature request proposes the implementation of \"DeepSignal\" inputs and models, which would provide a more convenient way to work with nested properties in objects, especially in scenarios involving two-way binding and forms.\r\n\r\nThe main benefits of this feature would be:\r\n\r\n- Easier listening to specific properties of complex objects without the need for additional computeds or equality checks.\r\n- Simplified template usage for nested properties.\r\n- More convenient handling of forms and filters with multiple fields.\r\n- Improved developer experience when working with complex data structures.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce two new functions: deepInput() and deepModel(), which would create DeepSignal instances. These would behave similarly to the existing input() and model() functions but with enhanced capabilities for nested properties.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n``` \r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  filterParams = deepInput<{param1: string, param2: string}>();\r\n  viewModel = deepModel<{name: string, password: string}>();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the template:\r\n```\r\n{{ filterParams.param2() }}\r\n<input type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"viewModel.name\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe DeepSignal type would need to be writable to support two-way binding scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis solution would be particularly beneficial in views with multiple filters, selections, and inputs, allowing developers to work with a single object rather than individual signals for each property. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface SomeProps {\r\n    dateRange: { start: Date, end: Date },\r\n    category: string,\r\n    searchTerm: string,\r\n    isActive: boolean\r\n}\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class FilterComponent {\r\n  filters = deepInput<SomeProps>();\r\n} \r\n```\r\nThis approach simplifies handling complex filter objects without creating separate inputs for each property.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. Using computed signals for each nested property: This approach works but leads to verbose code and doesn't solve the two-way binding issue elegantly.\r\n2. Creating custom operators or utility functions: While this could provide similar functionality, it wouldn't be as seamless as having built-in support in Angular.\r\n\r\nBy implementing DeepSignal inputs and models, we can significantly improve the developer experience when working with complex objects in Angular applications, especially in scenarios involving forms and filtering.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/57955","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"DeepSignal Inputs and Models\" (#57955)"},{"Id":"2545902637","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-25T08:32:25","Actor":"devversion","Number":"57947","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(migrations): migrate toArray and get methods in query migration","State":"closed","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/57947","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(migrations): migrate toArray and get methods in query migration\" (#57947)"},{"Id":"2544556214","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-25T08:22:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"57939","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove redundant no-prerender Bazel flags for adev","State":"closed","Body":"These flags were previously used to disable prerendering in CI builds.

work well with signal inputs, queries, output, or other non-decorator APIs.\r\n\r\nThat is because the `setClassMetadata` calls (generated for JIT) are used to re-compile the component with the

in TestBed. \r\n   * Will be hard to detect output as it's non-distinguishable from decorator outputs.\r\n   * I guess, we could fully re-use inputs, queries etc. metadata instead of relying on prop

Here is a concrete example of what I mean (albeit very simple and refactorable): \r\n\r\n```ts \r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-text',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [FormsModule],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>Type some value:</div>\r\n    <input type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"value\"/>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class TextComponent {\r\n  value = signal<string>('');\r\n\r\n  private length = computed(() => this.value().length);\r\n  private length$ = toObservable(this.length);\r\n  lengthDidChange = outputFromObservable(this.length$);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * I'd like to emit any time lenght changes.\r\n   *\r\n   * Ideally:\r\n   *\r\n   * lengthDidChange = output<number>({ from: this.length });\r\n   * or\r\n   * lengthDidChange = output<number>({ from: ()=> {return ... } });\r\n   * or\r\n   * lengthDidChange = outputFrom<number>(()=> {return ... });\r\n   */\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  standalone: true,\r\n  imports: [TextComponent],\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-text (lengthDidChange)=\"lengthDidChange($event)\"/>\r\n    <hr>\r\n    <div>{{ desc() }}</div>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class App {\r\n  length = signal<number | undefined>(undefined);\r\n  desc = computed(() => `Length is ${this.length()}`);\r\n\r\n  lengthDidChange(value: number): void {\r\n    this.length.set(value);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-lazelp?file=src%2Fmain.ts\r\n\r\nThe pattern is basically: any time a component `internal` signal changes => emit the new value (no need to call emit, no observables, ...). \r\n\r\nOf course, you could say: in the example above, you should use `ngModelChange`, setup a method in `TextComponent ` and emit. That's true for such example (again very simple). \r\n\r\nBut as usual, the story changes as soon as the example gets more complicated (more components, more needs to synchronise values, ...). In general, I think more complicated scenarios could be addressed by devs using `effects` (which is by the way the case with `toObservable` 😅). \r\n\r\nI hope I haven't missed anything trivial (stupidity is always around the corner 😅). \r\n\r\nThanks a lot! \r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIntroduce some sort of declarative way of creating an `output` from signals. \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nDepends on the use case. In general, the way to go is to have a more imperative approach to `emit`.

Source](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/compare/19.0.0-next.6...19.0.0-next.7)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### core\n\n-   Changes to effect timing which generally has two implications:\n\n    -   effects which are triggered outside of change detection run as part of\n        the change detection process instead of as a microtask. Depending on the\n        specifics of application/test setup, this can result in them executing\n        earlier or later (or requiring additional test steps to trigger; see below\n        examples).\n\n    -   effects which are triggered during change detection (e.g. by input\n        signals) run *earlier*, before the component's template.\n\n    We've seen a few common failure cases:\n\n    -   Tests which used to rely on the `Promise` timing of effects now need to\n        `await whenStable()` or call `.detectChanges()` in order for effects to\n        run.\n\n    -   Tests which use faked clocks may need to fast-forward/flush the clock to\n        cause effects to run.\n\n    -   `effect()`s triggered during CD could rely on the application being fully\n        rendered (for example, they could easily read computed styles, etc). With\n        the change, they run before the component's updates and can get incorrect\n        answers. The recent `afterRenderEffect()` API is a natural replacement for\n        this style of effect.\n\n    -   `effect()`s which synchronize with the forms system are particularly\n        timing-sensitive and might need to adjust their initialization timing.\n-   `ExperimentalPendingTasks` has been renamed to\n    `PendingTasks`.\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [fc59e2a7b7](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/fc59e2a7b7afa491a5ea740284a742574805eb36) | feat | change effect() execution timing & no-op `allowSignalWrites` ([#&#8203;57874](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/57874)) |\n| [a7eff3ffaa](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/a7eff3ffaaecbcb3034130d475ff7b4e41a1e1cc) | feat | mark signal-based query APIs as stable ([#&#8203;57921](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/57921)) |\n| [a1f229850a](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/a1f229850ad36da009f772faa831da173a60268c) | feat | migrate ExperimentalPendingTasks to PendingTasks ([#&#8203;57533](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/57533)) |\n| [950a5540f1](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/950a5540f15118e7360506ad82ec9dab5a11f789) | fix | Ensure the `ViewContext` is retained after closure minification ([#&#8203;57903](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/57903)) |\n\n##### language-service\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [7ecfd89592](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/commit/7ecfd8959219b6e2ec19e1244a6694711daf1782) | fix | The suppress diagnostics option should work for external templates ([#&#8203;57873](https://redirect.github.com/angular/angular/pull/57873)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

See npm's documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.\n\n-   Drop support for older platforms ([#&#8203;3902](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3902))\n\n    This release drops support for the following operating system:\n\n    -   macOS 10.15 Catalina\n\n    This is because the Go programming language dropped support for this operating system version in Go 1.23, and this release updates esbuild from Go 1.22 to Go 1.23. Go 1.23 now requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later.\n\n    Note that this only affects the binary esbuild executables that are published to the esbuild npm package. It's still possible to compile esbuild's source code for these older operating systems. If you need to, you can compile esbuild for yourself using an older version of the Go compiler (before Go version 1.23). That might look something like this:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/evanw/esbuild.git\n        cd esbuild\n        go build ./cmd/esbuild\n        ./esbuild --version\n\n-   Fix class field decorators in TypeScript if `useDefineForClassFields` is `false` ([#&#8203;3913](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3913))\n\n    Setting the `useDefineForClassFields` flag to `false` in `tsconfig.json` means class fields use the legacy TypeScript behavior instead of the standard JavaScript behavior. Specifically they use assign semantics instead of define semantics (e.g. setters are triggered) and fields without an initializer are not initialized at all. However, when this legacy behavior is combined with standard JavaScript decorators, TypeScript switches to always initializing all fields, even those without initializers. Previously esbuild incorrectly continued to omit field initializers for this edge case. These field initializers in this case should now be emitted starting with this release.\n\n-   Avoid incorrect cycle warning with `tsconfig.json` multiple inheritance ([#&#8203;3898](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3898))\n\n    TypeScript 5.0 introduced multiple inheritance for `tsconfig.json` files where `extends` can be an array of file paths. Previously esbuild would incorrectly treat files encountered more than once when processing separate subtrees of the multiple inheritance hierarchy as an inheritance cycle. With this release, `tsconfig.json` files containing this edge case should work correctly without generating a warning.\n\n-   Handle Yarn Plug'n'Play stack overflow with `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3915](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3915))\n\n    Previously a `tsconfig.json` file that `extends` another file in a package with an `exports` map could cause a stack overflow when Yarn's Plug'n'Play resolution was active. This edge case should work now starting with this release.\n\n-   Work around more issues with Deno 1.31+ ([#&#8203;3917](https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3917))\n\n    This version of Deno broke the `stdin` and `stdout` properties on command objects for inherited streams, which matters when you run esbuild's Deno module as the entry point (i.e. when `import.meta.main` is `true`). Previously esbuild would crash in Deno 1.31+ if you ran esbuild like that. This should be fixed starting with this release.\n\n    This fix was contributed by [@&#8203;Joshix-1](https://redirect.github.com/Joshix-1).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup (rollup)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.22.4`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4224)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.22.3...v4.22.4)\n\n*2024-09-21*\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Fix a vulnerability in generated code that affects IIFE, UMD and CJS bundles when run in a browser context ([#&#8203;5671](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5671))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5670](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5670): refactor: Use object.prototype to check for reserved properties ([@&#8203;YuHyeonWook](https://redirect.github.com/YuHyeonWook))\n-   [#&#8203;5671](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5671): Fix DOM Clobbering CVE ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://redirect.github.com/lukastaegert))\n\n### [`v4.22.3`](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#4223)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v4.22.2...v4.22.3)\n\n*2024-09-21*\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Ensure that mutations in modules without side effects are observed while properly handling transitive dependencies ([#&#8203;5669](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5669))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;5669](https://redirect.github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/5669): Ensure impure dependencies of pure modules are added ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://redirect.github.com/lukastaegert))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However, when using the `reset()` method with reactive forms, the form controls are unexpectedly marked as `touched` or `dirty`, causing **validation errors** to display immediately. This behavior is not intuitive and negatively impacts user experience, as the form appears to have errors even though no user interaction has occurred post-reset.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a stepper with multiple steps using Angular Material and reactive forms.\r\n2. Assign required validators to form controls in each step.\r\n3. Complete the stepper steps, then use the `reset()` method on the stepper to reset it.\r\n4. Observe that form controls are marked as `touched` or `dirty` even though the stepper was reset, and validation errors are displayed.\r\n5. Alternatively, you can also use the native `mat-stepper`: https://material.angular.io/components/stepper/examples#stepper-errors\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter calling `stepper.reset()`, all form controls should be reset to their initial state, marked as pristine and untouched. No validation errors should be displayed until the user interacts with the form controls again.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCalling `stepper.reset()` resets the stepper and form groups but marks all form controls as `touched` or `dirty`, triggering validation errors to display immediately.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: `18.1.1`\r\n- CDK/Material: `18.1.1`\r\n- Browser(s): `Google Chrome`_(Version 127.0.6533.73 (Official Build) (arm64))_\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): `macOS(Sonoma 14.7)`, _Apple M1_\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29781","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(Stepper): Stepper `reset()` Method Marks Form Controls as `Touched/Dirty`, Triggering Validation Errors\" (#29781)"},{"Id":"2540752632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T06:28:37","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29775","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function","State":"closed","Body":"Reworks the `youtube-player` to use the `inject` function instead of constructor-based injection.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29775","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(youtube-player): switch to inject function\" (#29775)"},{"Id":"2543959611","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T23:49:53","Actor":"naaajii","Number":"29779","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/tabs): add `alignTabs` in `MatTabsConfig`","State":"open","Body":"users can align tabs label via config now rather than adding `mat-tab-align` property on each tab group\r\n\r\nfixes #29685","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29779","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/tabs): add `alignTabs` in `MatTabsConfig`\" (#29779)"},{"Id":"2543298796","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:58:08","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29778","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move classes out of core","State":"open","Body":"* Moves the mat-app-background class out of core\r\n* Moves the mat-elevation-* classes out of core","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29778","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor: move classes out of core\" (#29778)"},{"Id":"2537084758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:53:39","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29766","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move mat-elevation-* classes out of core","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29766","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: move mat-elevation-* classes out of core\" (#29766)"},{"Id":"2537061637","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:53:35","Actor":"wagnermaciel","Number":"29765","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: move mat-app-background out of core","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29765","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: move mat-app-background out of core\" (#29765)"},{"Id":"2536505461","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T17:41:16","Actor":"btiller123","Number":"29764","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(COMPONENT): The documented example for creating a flat tree used deprecated controls","State":"closed","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nAccording to the release notes for 18.2.0 in https://github.com/angular/components/releases, many tree controls have been deprecated which my IDE shows the same as well.

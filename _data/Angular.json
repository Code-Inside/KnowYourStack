For now, it it sufficient to pass the tests generated by the `ng new` application and we will continue to expand on this design going forward.\r\n\r\nEnable the Jest runner by updating the `test` builder in your `angular.json` to be:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"my-app\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        // ...\r\n        \"test\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:jest\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current approach is to pre-build application tests with the `browser-esbuild` Angular builder under the hood, and then run Jest on the JavaScript outputs.

Many developers create tools to manage multiple Node.js versions in the same development environment. This approach allows them to use older Node.js versions for maintaining old projects and newer versions for developing new projects. In short, with a Node.js version manager, developers can use any version of Node.js.\r\n\r\nI developed a Node.js version manager for my team that has supported us for 8 years.\r\n\r\nFor 8 years, we have been using Angular as the core framework for Electron rendering processes. Due to my conservative personality, outdated system deployment environments, and the need for V8-bytecode processing for Electron main process code, we have only used Angular versions 12.2.x and older.\r\n\r\nTonight, I started a new project in Windows 10 using my Node.js version manager. After creating a directory, I installed Angular CLI version 15.2.6 using the command `npm i -D @angular/cli`. However, when I tried to create an Angular project using the `npm run ng new ...` command in the same directory, I received an error: `The system cannot find the path specified`. To create a new project using the `ng` command, I had to run the following command:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nnode ./node_modules/.bin/../@angular/cli/bin/ng.js new project-name --commit=false --defaults=true --inline-style=true --package-manager=npm --routing=true --skip-git=true --skip-install=true --strict=true --style=less --view-encapsulation=Emulated --create-application=false --new-project-root=./\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo execute the ng command in the newly created project (project-name), I had to modify all scripts related to the `ng` command, like this:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n  \"ng\": \"node ./node_modules/.bin/../@angular/cli/bin/ng.js\",\r\n  \"start\": \"npm run ng serve\",\r\n  \"build\": \"npm run ng build\",\r\n  \"watch\": \"npm run ng build --watch --configuration development\",\r\n  \"test\": \"npm run ng test\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter modifying these scripts, other commands can be executed like this:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nnpm run ng g -- application main --inline-style=true --prefix=chenhuiran --routing=true --skip-install=true --strict=true --style=less --view-encapsulation=Emulated\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an important part of the integrated development environment, Angular CLI plays a core role in project development. It would be great if it could be backward compatible during upgrades. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, this is just a complaint. I understand that you're busy, so I won't disturb you any further.\r\n\r\nI hope the above content can be useful to some people.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25049","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Execute ng command with node\" (#25049)"},{"Id":"1680022353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-23T13:22:50","Actor":"ashuvax","Number":"25051","RawContent":null,"Title":"remove component","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nupdate\n\n### Description\n\nOption to delete component and modules via cli\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nadd ng r c [name]\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25051","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"remove component\" (#25051)"},{"Id":"1679951822","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-23T10:01:21","Actor":"olfek","Number":"25050","RawContent":null,"Title":"Webpack Asset Modules Support","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nContinuation of #22351 \r\n\r\nIn Angular, am I correct in saying that there is currently no way of doing this:\r\n\r\nhttps://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/#source-assets\r\n\r\n?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSupport for Asset Modules or something similar\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nCurrently, this can be done in Angular with\r\n\r\nhttps://v4.webpack.js.org/loaders/raw-loader/\r\n\r\nbut it is DEPRECATED in favor of Asset Modules.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25050","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Webpack Asset Modules Support\" (#25050)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1685786733","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T21:52:08","Actor":"yogeshgadge","Number":"26996","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(MatSelectHarness): MatSelectHarness clickOptions does not work","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n\r\n```\r\n    const select = await loader.getHarness(selectHarness.with({selector: '#basic'}));\r\n    await select.clickOptions({ text: '10' });\r\n    const selected = await select.getValueText();\r\n    expect(selected).toBe('10');\r\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\n[MatSelectHarness - specs](https://harness-issue-86nzcu.stackblitz.io)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should reflect the selected text value\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDoes not set the selected value\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material:\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26996","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(MatSelectHarness): MatSelectHarness clickOptions does not work\" (#26996)"},{"Id":"1684561945","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T09:25:20","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"26994","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update scorecard config","State":"closed","Body":"Updates the scoredcard config to include the ID token.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/26994","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update scorecard config\" (#26994)"},{"Id":"1684535980","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T08:33:46","Actor":"alastair-todd","Number":"26993","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(all components): Test id attributes for internal elements","State":"open","Body":"### Feature Description\n\nThe v15 mdc merge has just butchered our e2e suite.\r\n\r\nThere are no known safe mechanisms to target material component internals e.g. a selected pseudo checkbox in a list item,.

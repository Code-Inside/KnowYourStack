It is a tooltip shown on hover inside of Calendar (or over the calendar to be precise). It can't be added to the DOM *as a child of Calendar* though due to certain CSS limitations with `position: fixed` + `overflow: auto`.\n\n**Here's the basic structure I want:**\n\n```\n<app-dashboard>\n  <app-whatever>\n    <app-random>\n      <app-calendar>I programmatically add a tooltip to my distant ancestor on hover</app-calendar>\n    </app-random>\n  </app-whatever>\n\n  <app-tooltip>I am programmatically rendered and destroyed</app-tooltip>\n<app-dashboard>\n```\n\nAfter searching the internet and the docs, I now think I have to use `createComponent()` inside Calendar component.\n\nI've tried to use the standalone `createComponent()` function as well as `viewContainer.createComponent()`. The latter doesn't allow to set a host element.\n\nThe former allows for that, but it has another issue: **when I destroy Tooltip using** `this.tooltipInstance.destroy()`**, it deletes the host element too.** That breaks the rendering of new tooltips, since there's no host element anymore: the component is still created on hover, as far as I see in the logs, but it's not rendered.\n\n**Here's my setup:**\n\n```\n<app-dashboard>\n  <app-wrapper>\n    <app-section>\n      <app-calendar>I programmatically add a tooltip to my distant ancestor on hover</app-calendar>\n    </app-section>\n  </app-wrapper>\n\n  <!-- I am wiped out on mouse leave :( -->\n  <div class=\"event-tooltip-host\">\n    <app-tooltip>I am programmatically rendered and destroyed</app-tooltip>\n  </div>\n<app-dashboard>\n```\n\n```\neventMouseEnter({ event, el }) {\n  this.tooltipInstance = createComponent(TooltipComponent, {\n    environmentInjector: this.injector,\n    hostElement: document.querySelector('.event-tooltip-host')!,\n    bindings: [inputBinding('event', () => event), inputBinding('element', () => el)]\n  })\n\n  this.appRef.attachView(this.tooltipInstance.hostView)\n  this.tooltipInstance.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()\n}\n\neventMouseLeave() {\n  this.appRef.detachView(this.tooltipInstance.hostView)\n  this.tooltipInstance.destroy()\n}\n```\n\nIt appears impossible to fully control dynamic rendering of a component back and forth from within a totally random component.\n\nMy backup plan is to do it from Dashboard component via some app-level actions which I can listen to in any component and then using `viewContainer.createComponent()`. But I would really expect Angular to have a better way to do it.\n\nSo, as I see it, the bug is that `hostElement` is destroyed along with the component.\n\nIf that's by design, is there any other way to achieve this without having to manage it with `viewContainer.createComponent()` inside Dashboard component?\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-7jb7bw6y\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 20.0.2\nNode: 22.15.1\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.22\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.3\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... language-service, material, material-moment-adapter\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router, service-worker\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.2\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.2\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.2\n@angular/build               20.0.2\n@angular/cli                 20.0.2\n@angular/fire                18.0.1\n@schematics/angular          20.0.2\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nwebpack                      5.99.9\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62150","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ComponentRef.destroy() deletes host element\" (#62150)"},{"Id":"3160867695","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-19T16:29:19","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"62149","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix deprecation message on ngIf/ngSwitch","State":"open","Body":"fixes #62147\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/62149","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: fix deprecation message on ngIf/ngSwitch\" (#62149)"},{"Id":"3160657692","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-19T16:25:41","Actor":"IslaBen","Number":"62148","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing route-data-resolvers page in documention","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nReading about [Dynamic data with data resolvers](https://angular.dev/guide/routing/define-routes#dynamic-data-with-data-resolvers) the link redirects the user to a \"Page Not Found 🙃\" due to missing documentation page\n\n### Enter the URL of the topic with the problem\n\nhttps://angular.dev/guide/router/route-data-resolvers\n\n### Describe what you were looking for in the documentation\n\nI was looking for documentation about how to use resolvers in routes get get dynamic data\n\n### Describe the actions that led you to experience the problem\n\nclicked on this [link](https://angular.dev/guide/router/route-data-resolvers) in this section : [Dynamic data with data resolvers](https://angular.dev/guide/routing/define-routes#dynamic-data-with-data-resolvers)\n\n### Describe what you want to experience that would fix the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add a screenshot if that helps illustrate the problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this problem caused an exception or error, please paste it here\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### If the problem is browser-specific, please specify the device, OS, browser, and version\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Provide any additional information here in as much as detail as you can\n\n```true\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/62148","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing route-data-resolvers page in documention\" (#62148)"},{"Id":"3160242699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-19T12:52:35","Actor":"BojanKogoj","Number":"62147","RawContent":null,"Title":"NgSwitch, NgSwitchCase, NgIf not displaying whole text in deprecation notice","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the problem that you experienced\n\nNot whole text is displayed in deprecation notice.

This occurs because the dependency `@xmpp/resolve` uses the `\"browser\"` field in its `package.json` to indicate that certain modules should be replaced or ignored for browser builds. However, the Angular build system (using ESBuild for production builds) does not honor the `\"browser\"` field, unlike the previous Webpack-based setup.\n\n#### Expected Behavior\n\nThe build process should respect the `\"browser\"` field in dependencies' `package.json` files, replacing or ignoring Node.js-only modules as indicated, resulting in a successful production build.\n\n#### Actual Behavior\n\nThe build fails with errors similar to the following:\n```\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"node:http\"\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"node:https\"\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"node:fs\"\n...\n```\nThis did not occur with older versions of Angular that used Webpack for production builds.\n\n#### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Clone the example repository:  \n   `git clone https://github.com/andsouto/angular-build-error-example.git`\n2. Install dependencies:  \n   `cd angular-build-error-example && npm install`\n3. Attempt to build the project for production:  \n   `ng build`\n4. Observe the build failure with unresolved Node.js module errors.\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/andsouto/angular-build-error-example\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nApplication bundle generation failed.

https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina/pull/590 (angular 19 uses `4.8.0` which was why this is not a problem until now)\n\nWe patched our version of the angular CLI to bump the `idleTimeout` here to be `10_000`, and that seems to have resolved it:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/2672f6ec17de6e05b19acda0e0b09a6715c9f83f/packages/angular/build/src/utils/worker-pool.ts#L18\n\nWould you accept a PR to apply that patch? (or maybe it could be `Infinity` to disable this check completely? I'm unsure what the consequences of that change would be though)\n\nI assume the issue is because our application source code is so large that it takes longer than 1s for the worker to initialise, and that timeout is hit.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nA minimal repro is not possible as:\n* The problem does not always occur (presumably because the worker sometimes initialises under the current 1s idle timeout)\n* The problem only occurs on resource constrained hardware (it cannot be reproduced locally on an M3 macbook, and only within github actions)\n* The problem only seems to affect large applications (100mb+ of source code).

As a result, associated template files (e.g., my-feature.html) are no longer automatically recognized by Prettier as Angular templates. This leads Prettier to fall back to its default HTML parser, which doesn't handle Angular-specific syntax correctly.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nTo improve the developer experience and avoid formatting issues, it would be helpful for new Angular projects to include a default Prettier configuration specifying the Angular parser for .html files.\n\nSuggested addition to package.json:\n\n\n```json\n\"prettier\": {\n  \"overrides\": [\n    {\n      \"files\": \"*.html\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"parser\": \"angular\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration ensures consistent and correct formatting of Angular templates out of the box, without requiring manual setup from the developer. It aligns with Angular’s philosophy of providing strong defaults for common tooling.\n\nThanks for considering this improvement!\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nInstead of `package.json`, we could consider having a `.prettierrc` file to set prettier configuration.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30548","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Default Prettier Configuration for Angular Templates\" (#30548)"},{"Id":"3152602636","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T08:26:23","Actor":"MikaStark","Number":"30547","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add engines Entry to package.json to Specify Required Node.js Versions","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nHello Angular Team,\n\nWhen starting a new Angular project, it's not immediately clear which Node.js versions are compatible—especially when working with older Angular versions. Unless developers check the [Version Compatibility](https://angular.dev/reference/versions) documentation, they may unknowingly use an unsupported Node.js version, leading to confusing errors.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA simple and effective solution would be to include an engines field in the generated package.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  // ...\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \"^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0 || ^24.0.0\"\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis is a standard Node.js feature that many tools and platforms (e.g., DigitalOcean, Vercel) can use to select the appropriate runtime environment during deployment or CI builds.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nOptionally, generating an .nvmrc file could help local development, but the engines field provides broader support and clearer intent.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30547","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add engines Entry to package.json to Specify Required Node.js Versions\" (#30547)"},{"Id":"3151034894","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T07:13:57","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"30545","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): json and json-summary as vitest coverage reporters","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check to confirm your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check all that apply using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The calendar component’s header control buttons (such as month selection and view mode selection) currently use aria-label attributes to provide accessible names for assistive technologies.\n\n**Current Limitation:**\nWhile the use of aria-label helps screen reader users, there are still usability and accessibility gaps:\n\nSighted users, users with cognitive difficulties, and users unfamiliar with icon-only interfaces may not easily understand the buttons' purposes.\nThere is no visible label or tooltip on these buttons, making their function unclear for many users.\nProposed Solution:\nEnhance the Angular Material calendar component to allow tooltips on header control buttons. These tooltips would display descriptive labels (e.g., “Choose date”, “Next month”) on hover or focus, benefiting all users and further aligning with WCAG 3.3.2.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\nImproves accessibility and usability for all users, not just those using assistive technology.\nProvides visible contextual guidance, reducing confusion for first-time or infrequent users.\nFurther supports compliance with WCAG 3.3.2 by providing both programmatic (aria-label) and visible (tooltip) labels.\nExample:\nWhen the user hovers or focuses on a calendar header control button, a tooltip should appear with an appropriate label for the button’s action.\n\nReferences:\n\n[WCAG 3.3.2: Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html)\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(material/calendar-header): Add Tooltip Support for Calendar Header Control Buttons to Provide Visible Accessible Labels\" (#31378)"},{"Id":"3141776315","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T23:41:22","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31350","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/tree): add tree directives, example, and tests","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31350","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/tree): add tree directives, example, and tests\" (#31350)"},{"Id":"3154185980","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T23:29:46","Actor":"ok7sai","Number":"31374","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk-experimental/tabs): add setDefaultState and unit tests, refactor the content children strategy","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31374","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk-experimental/tabs): add setDefaultState and unit tests, refactor the content children strategy\" (#31374)"},{"Id":"3144816448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T21:46:27","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31355","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove unused typography function","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31355","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: remove unused typography function\" (#31355)"},{"Id":"3151338010","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T17:53:16","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31366","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/slide-toggle): use token system for label text","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31366","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/slide-toggle): use token system for label text\" (#31366)"},{"Id":"3151009974","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T17:49:33","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31361","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove duplicate theme style warnings","State":"closed","Body":"Removes the Sass warning about duplicate styles being emitted.

We now ship a behaviour that only some engines still support.\n- **Hard to opt out** — apps that prefer native behaviour must add custom directives just to undo the framework’s side-effect.\n- **Questionable default** — wheel-spin is widely regarded as error-prone; many design systems leave it off unless the app explicitly opts-in.\n- **Big change for a small bug** — the original issue surfaced only after a tooltip attached its own wheel listener; solving that by adding another listener to every number input feels disproportionate.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n1. Remove the automatic wheel listener from MatInput.\n2. Re-open #29074 and fix it at the tooltip level (e.g. use a scroll listener or attach wheel outside the event path of inputs).\n3. If needed, expose an opt-in flag like enableWheelIncrement for teams that really want the legacy behaviour.\n\nThis restores native defaults, keeps Material aligned with browser evolution, and lets developers choose the experience that fits their users.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n\n1. Open any Angular Material form that contains `<input matInput type=\"number\">` in **Chrome** (Blink)\n2. Focus the field, keep the cursor over it, and spin the mouse-wheel.\n3. **Actual result**: the numeric value increments or decrements.\n**Expected**: per MDN / HTML guidance, the wheel should scroll the page unless the site explicitly opts-in. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number\n4.

Start with Angular 19.2.13 project\n2. Install Jest, jest-preset-angular, etc.\n3. Import from @angular/common in a test:\n4. import { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';\n5.

Introduction to the Stackblitz project:\n\n1. GimmeComponent is a component with the effect in question. It reacts to value changes and status changes of an AbstractControl. \"Test 1\" is a working effect: as soon as the value or the status changes, it triggers a console log and counts a counter up.  \"Test 2\" is the same but with a different condition order and it doesn't work even though (to me) it should.\n2. AppComponent is the component using Gimme. It includes a \"test\" button that just sets a custom error on the FormGroup in question. There is also a validator that reports an error whenever the field is empty.\n\n**Steps to reproduce the bug**:\n1. Input any one character into the input field so the FormGroup validator says it's valid (e.g. number or letter).\n2. Click the \"test\" button to invalidate the FormGroup.\n3. Remove the input from the field, so the FormGroup switches from one invalid state (set by the button in step 2) to another invalid state (set by the validator being mad at a now empty field).\n\n**Expected result**: \"Valid?\" & \"Errors\" get updated and \"if clause in effect triggered\" counts up.\nWith the effect in \"Test 1\" in GimmeComponent, **it works as expected**. With the effect in \"Test 2\", **it doesn't**, even though the only difference is the order of the conditions. \"Valid?\" and \"Errors\" get updated by Angular itself, but the counter is what's important.\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ftahpx37?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nWhatever Stackblitz is using and Angular v20. (reproduceable in v17-20)\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI'm sure it's possible to make the example even simpler and still show the bug happening but that's as minimal as I got it. I'm also not sure whether I understood effects completely but to my knowledge, it should work both ways here.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/61827","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Execution order confusion in effect with multiple signals\" (#61827)"},{"Id":"3110446709","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-02T14:30:50","Actor":"devversion","Number":"61826","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: migrate `packages/compiler-cli` to `ts_project`","State":"open","Body":"This commit migrates the remaining pieces of `compiler-cli` to `ts_project`.

The error occurs during the package loading\n  phase, specifically in the @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer dependency.\n\n\n  Root Cause Analysis\n\n  The issue appears to be in the @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer@2.0.18 package that's a dependency of @angular/cli@19.2.14. The error occurs at line 30:62 in the compiled JavaScript\n  where it's trying to extend a class that's undefined.\n\n  This suggests:\n  1. Missing or incompatible inquirer dependency\n  2. Version mismatch between @listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer and its peer dependencies\n  3. Potential ESM/CommonJS module resolution issue\n\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n  Steps to Reproduce\n\n  1. Create an Angular 19.2.14 project or use existing one\n  2. Run ng add @angular/ssr --project=<project-name>\n  3. Error occurs during \"Loading package information from registry\" phase\n\n  Workaround\n\n  The issue can be bypassed by:\n  1. Manually installing @angular/ssr via npm install @angular/ssr --legacy-peer-deps\n  2. Manually creating the required SSR configuration files following the documentation\n  3. Updating angular.json manually for SSR build configuration\n\n  Expected Behavior\n\n  The ng add @angular/ssr command should successfully add server-side rendering support to the project without errors.\n\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\nError Details\n\n  $ ng add @angular/ssr --project=marketplace-app\n  ✔ Determining Package Manager\n    › Using package manager: npm\n  ✔ Searching for compatible package version\n    › Found compatible package version: @angular/ssr@19.2.14.\n  ✔ Loading package information from registry\n  ✖ Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\n  An unhandled exception occurred: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\n  See \"/tmp/ng-xYMb4w/angular-errors.log\" for further details.\n\n  Error Log Contents:\n  [error] TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\n      at Object.<anonymous> (/home/ubuntu/xxxxx/node_modules/@listr2/prompt-adapter-inquirer/dist/index.cjs:30:62)\n      at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1730:14)\n      at Object..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1895:10)\n      at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1465:32)\n      at Function._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1282:12)\n      at TracingChannel.traceSync (node:diagnostics_channel:322:14)\n      at wrapModuleLoad (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:235:24)\n      at Module.require (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1487:12)\n      at require (node:internal/modules/helpers:135:16)\n      at /home/ubuntu/xxxxx/node_modules/@angular/cli/src/commands/add/cli.js:265:108\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nEnvironment\n\n  - Angular CLI: 19.2.14\n  - Angular: 19.2.14\n  - Node: (include your version)\n  - Package Manager: npm\n  - OS: Linux (WSL2)\n  - Project: Multi-project workspace with existing Angular 19.2.14 applications\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n  Additional Context\n\n  - This issue persists even after clearing npm cache and reinstalling Angular CLI\n  - The error is consistent across multiple attempts\n  - Using --legacy-peer-deps for other npm operations works fine\n  - The project has some Angular 18-compatible dependencies that were temporarily removed to isolate the issue\n\n  Relevant Repository: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli\n  Component: ng add command / SSR schematic","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30448","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng add @angular/ssr fails with \"Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null\" error\" (#30448)"},{"Id":"3104897204","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-02T20:16:41","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30431","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update rules_angular digest to e0f7af7","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| rules_angular | git_repository | digest | `8952a28` -> `e0f7af7` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 5:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It also requires a change from a relative path\n\n    iconRegistry.addSvgIcon('help', sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('assets/image/help.svg'));\n\nto an absolute path:\n\n    iconRegistry.addSvgIcon('help', sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('/assets/image/help.svg'));\n\nTo allow for a smooth migration process and not to require changes to the application code, it would be best if the Vitest test runner would default to not using the additional path segment or at least to provide a configuration option.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Create src/assets/image/help.svg\n1. Change angular.json to include architect.build.options.assets: [\"src/assets\"]\n1.

Especially since `vite` is already used for build & serve.\n\nEarly feedback for vitest in Angular v20. Based on a quick browse of `packages/angular/build/src/builders/unit-test/builder.ts` there doesn't seem to be a way to pass configuration settings.\n\nFor this to be even slightly usable, you would need to set vitest options such as:\n- timeouts\n- setupFiles\n- coverage (specify lcov reporter)\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nOne option is letting people pass vitest options in `angular.json` and doing a deep object merge.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nPersonally I would rather see less obfuscation... let people have a `vitest.config.ts`.\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vitest/config\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  test: {}\n});\n```\n\nYou could add a plugin (like `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular`)\n\nYou could also provide an angular`defineConfig`. Then you can strongly type the options and include/exclude ones that make sense for angular.\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"@angular/vitest\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({ ... });\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30429","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[@angular/build:unit-test][vitest] Configurable vitest\" (#30429)"},{"Id":"3104089547","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T19:33:29","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30428","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update cross-repo angular dependencies","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://redirect.github.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `d902f7a` -> `0d34d82` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://redirect.github.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `fe0043e` -> `22ed4b0` |\n| [@angular/common](https://redirect.github.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `0419f0a` -> `420bab4` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `de5e41c` -> `1cff528` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://redirect.github.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `603a1e6` -> `9515739` |\n| [@angular/core](https://redirect.github.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `5532cd3` -> `eb1dd5c` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://redirect.github.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `6ce4f51` -> `2485706` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://redirect.github.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `413dacf` -> `2c38235` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://redirect.github.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `cdb3efe` -> `ed1388a` |\n| [@angular/material](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `fdab0b4` -> `4c4ad79` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://redirect.github.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f371968` -> `8348769` |\n| [@angular/ng-dev](https://redirect.github.com/angular/dev-infra-private-ng-dev-builds) | devDependencies | digest | `8767c68` -> `0ba20dc` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `2e752e3` -> `074bdc4` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `394b1e7` -> `45eb60b` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://redirect.github.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `7376be5` -> `8d81ec1` |\n| [@angular/router](https://redirect.github.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `828ac46` -> `abe1bfe` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://redirect.github.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `cc84856` -> `bf6b6ee` |\n| angular/dev-infra | action | digest | `1854e46` -> `4fa572d` |\n| devinfra | git_repository | digest | `1854e46` -> `4fa572d` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Here's a link to the changes that the update procedure and I did to migrate: \n\nhttps://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-speculoos/pull/402/files\n\nI also tried to adopt the new way of referencing projects in the tsconfig file, if that matters.\n\nSince that change however, the file `index.d.ts` file generated by `ng build --project ngx-speculoos` does not include the jasmine matchers that are supposed to be generated from [this import](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-speculoos/blob/3c7af6e57fe3261d4ee28d8e7a97e0797a1f8ea4/projects/ngx-speculoos/src/public_api.ts#L4), referencing [this file](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-speculoos/blob/chore/ng20/projects/ngx-speculoos/src/jasmine-matchers.ts).\n\nIt used to work fine before the upgrade. The build used to generate the following files (among others):\n\n- index.d.ts, which exported everything from public_api;\n- public_api.d.ts, which imported './jasmine-matchers' and exported everything from a bunch of other files;\n- jasmine-matchers.d.ts, defining the additional matchers\n\nAfter the upgrade, the build only has an index.d.ts, where doesn't contain any sign of the jasmine matchers.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:Ninja-Squad/ngx-speculoos.git\ngit checkout chore/ng20\npnpm i\npnpm ng build --project ngx-speculoos\n```\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```text\nAngular CLI: 20.0.0\nNode: 20.19.2\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.11.0\nOS: darwin x64\n\nAngular: 20.0.0\n... build, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                      Version\n------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.2000.0\n@angular-devkit/core         20.0.0\n@angular-devkit/schematics   20.0.0\n@schematics/angular          20.0.0\nng-packagr                   20.0.0\nrxjs                         7.8.2\ntypescript                   5.8.3\nzone.js                      0.15.1\n```\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/30425","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing typing in library after upgrade to v20\" (#30425)"},{"Id":"3102096534","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T07:31:27","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"30424","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update dependency aspect_bazel_lib to v2.17.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [aspect_bazel_lib](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib) | http_archive | patch | `v2.17.0` -> `v2.17.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>aspect-build/bazel-lib (aspect_bazel_lib)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.17.1`](https://redirect.github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-lib/releases/tag/v2.17.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/compare/v2.17.0...v2.17.1)\n\n#### Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6:\n\n1.

This is especially useful in scenarios such as:\n\nAppointment Scheduling:\n\nAllow users to select times only during business hours (e.g., 09:00–17:00).\n\nPrevent booking outside working hours or during system maintenance windows.\n\nForm Validation Consistency:\n\nAlign timepicker constraints with backend validation rules.\n\nEnsure users can’t select invalid times that would be rejected by the API.\n\nTime-based Access Control:\n\nLimit actions (e.g., fund transfers or reservations) to certain hours of the day.\n\nPrevent users from interacting with restricted services outside allowed times.\n\nEnhanced User Experience:\n\nDisable irrelevant time options directly in the timepicker dropdown.\n\nReduce form submission errors by guiding the user to valid selections.\n\nThese are common real-world use cases in banking apps, healthcare scheduling, logistics portals, etc., and currently require complex custom logic or third-party solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat(MatTimepicker): support minTime and maxTime inputs similar to MatDatepicker\" (#31273)"},{"Id":"3108021420","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-01T23:26:40","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31272","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): use system for neutral colors","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31272","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/form-field): use system for neutral colors\" (#31272)"},{"Id":"3098904123","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-01T20:28:14","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31252","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: add colors to m2 system tokens","State":"closed","Body":"Adds M2 system tokens for:\r\n- primary, on-primary\r\n- secondary, on-secondary\r\n- error, on-error","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31252","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: add colors to m2 system tokens\" (#31252)"},{"Id":"3105647442","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-01T19:55:40","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"31268","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: converge remaining secondary text to on-surface-variant","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31268","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor: converge remaining secondary text to on-surface-variant\" (#31268)"},{"Id":"3107215715","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-01T12:55:22","Actor":"jjalbuenacabuyao","Number":"31271","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/dialog): dialog's container-color does not follow Material 3 design specs","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a bug in the Angular Material dialog component where dialog uses `surface` container-color instead of `surface-container-high` as per Material 3 guidelines.\r\n\r\nFixes #30536","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/31271","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material/dialog): dialog's container-color does not follow Material 3 design specs\" (#31271)"},{"Id":"3103478633","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-01T07:34:29","Actor":"hamfastgamgee","Number":"31263","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(migrations): Angular 20 update migrations stripping BOM from UTF8 files that have them","State":"closed","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe Angular 20 migration for Material (presumably the one that fixes variable names) is changing files of various types (TS, CSS, HTML, and SCSS) en masse from UTF-8 to Windows-1252 encoding on Windows, even if there is otherwise nothing at all to replace in those files.

While this behavior aligns with accessibility guidelines (WCAG), it creates a **usability issue** for the user interface.\n\nThe `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode are not merely decorative animations — they are **functional indicators** of background activity (e.g., data loading, request processing). Disabling animations entirely when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is enabled renders these components static, which can mislead users into thinking the interface is \"frozen\" or unresponsive. This is especially problematic in **single-page applications (SPAs)**, where these components often serve as replacements for native browser loading indicators.\n\nI intentionally enable `prefers-reduced-motion` in Windows 10 to reduce distracting or resource-heavy animations, such as window transitions. However, even with this setting enabled, browsers like **Firefox** and **Chrome** still provide **minimal animations** (e.g., tab loading spinners) to indicate progress. In SPAs, where we rely on custom loading indicators like `mat-progress-bar`, the absence of any animation severely impacts UX.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active, the `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` components in `indeterminate` mode should support a **minimal, non-intrusive animation** to maintain their role as activity indicators. For example:\n\n- **mat-progress-bar**: A subtle bar movement or pulsation, avoiding abrupt transitions.\n- **mat-progress-spinner**: A slow rotation or pulsation instead of complete animation disablement.\n\nAdditionally, developers should be able to **opt-in** to minimal animations via:\n\n- Module configuration (`MatProgressBarModule`, `MatProgressSpinnerModule`)\n- Token-based control (e.g., `MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS`)\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Enable the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting in **Windows 10**:\n   - Go to **Settings → Ease of Access → Display**\n   - Turn off **\"Show animations in Windows\"**\n\n2. Create an Angular application using **Angular Material 20**.\n\n3. Add a `mat-progress-bar` or `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode:\n\n    ```html\n    <mat-progress-bar mode=\"indeterminate\"></mat-progress-bar>\n    <mat-progress-spinner mode=\"indeterminate\"></mat-progress-spinner>\n    ```\n\n4. Open the app in a browser (e.g., **Firefox**).\n\n5. Observe that both components are **completely static**, even during ongoing tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Actual Result\n\nWith `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` enabled, animations for `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode are **fully disabled**, causing the interface to appear **unresponsive** or **frozen**.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Result\n\nThese components should display a **minimal, accessibility-compliant animation** to indicate ongoing activity (e.g., slow movement or pulsation), rather than being completely static.\n\n---\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Angular Material**: 20.0.1  \n- **Angular**: 20.0.0  \n- **Browser**: Firefox (latest), Chrome (latest)  \n- **OS**: Windows 10  \n- **prefers-reduced-motion**: `reduce` (enabled manually)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- This issue is reproducible on the **Angular Material docs site** ([material.angular.dev](https://material.angular.dev)).\n- Attempts to override the behavior via CSS or the `MATERIAL_ANIMATIONS` token were **unsuccessful**.\n- Even in `prefers-reduced-motion` mode, browsers show **minimal tab loading animations**, emphasizing the need for similar UX in SPAs.\n- Possibly related PR: [#30796](https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30796) — automatic handling of `prefers-reduced-motion`.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\n- ✅ Implement a **minimal, non-intrusive animation** for `mat-progress-bar` and `mat-progress-spinner` in `indeterminate` mode when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active.\n- ✅ Provide a **configuration option** (e.g., via module or DI token) to **enable minimal animations** under `prefers-reduced-motion`.\n- ✅ **Document** this behavior clearly in the Angular Material documentation and offer guidance for **customization**.\n\n\n### Use Case\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/31265","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Minimal Animation for mat-progress-bar and mat-progress-spinner in indeterminate Mode with prefers-reduced-motion Enabled\" (#31265)"},{"Id":"3101629401","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T22:44:03","Actor":"adolgachev","Number":"31257","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/menu): do not auto-focus when hover opens menu","State":"closed","Body":"Currently, when a menu item is hovered over, it will automatically open the sub-menu and also focus the first item within the sub-menu.\r\n\r\nWhen VoiceOver is enabled, the focus will then fire another hover event, and then the next sub-menu will open and so on.

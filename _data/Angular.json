On receipt, client needs to be able to decrypt the content before passing to normal 'showNotification' flow. \n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe simplest solution in my mind would be a callback that allows you to modify the notification payload before continuing to show it.

Locally reverting that change fixes the issue and you get the earlier behavior.\n\nThe use case may be little bit unconventional, but we have separate list for \"items to buy\" and then items for being in \"shopping basket\" (using one of the examples in website). They are in different components and connected by one parent component. Everything works greatly until the \"product selection\" component is destroyed. It works when there are sane number of items ,say 500. But when there are over 4000 items, the browser becomes unusable.\n\nI'm able to repro this same behavior in Stackblitz. Though, it needs a lot more items before it starts to break: 40000.\n\nOur actual code is years old, so it may be that it would be instructed to write it another way. \n\nIs there a way that `this._syncItemsWithRef();` would not be called for every item in a row if it happens really quickly? Or is there a better way to disconnect the drop lists before the component is destroyed? Or could there be a setting to opt into the old behavior? \n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://1owdqzmq.stackblitz.io\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.  Change array size to be 40 000 for example\n2. Click \"Hide source\" in template\n3. Notice how slow everything becomes\n\nWith smaller array, it's not noticeable at all.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should not be so taxing operation that it basically crashes browser tab\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCrashes browser tab :/ \n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.7\n- CDK/Material: ^19.2.0\n- Browser(s): chrome, firefox\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30737","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(drag-and-drop): disconnecting drop list is really slow after version 19.1.5\" (#30737)"},{"Id":"2953575180","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-28T13:28:56","Actor":"devversion","Number":"30731","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migrate `ng_module`","State":"closed","Body":"See individual commits","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30731","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Migrate `ng_module`\" (#30731)"},{"Id":"2954908597","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-28T03:18:00","Actor":"WwwHhhYran","Number":"30735","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(cdk-tree): tree with levelAccessor only renders all nodes","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nThe tree with `levelAccessor` and flat data can only render all nodes, and when I click on the `cdkTreeNodeToggle` component, it still only renders all nodes, and does not have the effect of expanding and collapsing nodes. \n\nHowever, when I use tree with `childrenAccessor` and nested data, it will render specific nodes based on the tree expansion. \n\nFor example, for the follwing node structure:\n```\n- parent 1\n   - leaf 1-1\n   - leaf 1-2\n\n- parent 2\n   - leaf 2-1\n   - leaf 2-2\n```\n**Demo 1** 👇\n\nWhen I use `levelAccessor` with flat type node data passed in, it will always show the above structure, no matter if I click to collapse parent 1 or parent 2 or not, it will still be the same.\n> link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/9hcrkwh5-mpxvoif7?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-tree-flat-level-accessor-example.ts\n\n**Demo 2** 👇\n\nWhen I use `childrenAccessor` with nested node data passed in, it can dynamically render the nodes based on the expanded and collapsed state. For example, when I click to collapse parent 1, the structure of the tree view is re-rendered as:\n```\n- parent 1\n\n- parent 2\n   - leaf 2-1\n   - leaf 2-2\n```\n> link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/qfnq49si-ubbjqylv?file=src%2Fexample%2Fcdk-tree-flat-children-accessor-example.ts\n\n\n**Extra** 📝\n\n Although I see that the [official demo](https://material.angular.io/cdk/tree/examples#cdk-tree-nested-level-accessor) hides nodes that don't need to be displayed by a combination of `style.display` and `shouldRender`.\n\nI think this is still a problem. Because in Demo 1 you have to use `style.display` and `shouldRender` to render correctly, while in Demo 2 you can render correctly without them. \n\nSo I think there is a difference in this behaviour that is problematic.\n\nThe same problem exists for `TreeControl`, but we can pass only specific node data into the tree's `dataStream` based on the treeControl's record of the node's isExpanded status.\n\n**Possible problem location** 🤔\nhttps://github.com/angular/components/blob/538b8bcd6e14044cc3dce87409eeac40f27941cf/src/cdk/tree/tree.ts#L1093-L1103\n\nThe `flattenedNodes` and `renderNodes` are both equal to `nodes`，maybe we should create a method like `shouldRender` that determines which nodes should be rendered and assigns them to `renderNodes`?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nsee **Desciption**\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCorrectly render visible nodes in the tree when expanding or collapsing nodes\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen use `levelAccessor` with flat data, can not render visible nodes in the tree correctly when expanding or collapsing nodes. But use `childrenAccessor` with nested data, correctly.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular: 19.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 19.2.0\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(cdk-tree): tree with levelAccessor only renders all nodes\" (#30735)"},{"Id":"2954430359","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-27T21:12:09","Actor":"rileyajones","Number":"30734","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a null check to autocomplete options","State":"open","Body":"If a mat-autocomplete element does not contain any mat-options it will throw a null pointer when it is unloaded.

Something like this:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6998f786-097a-4fe3-a91f-e78457b526c2)\n\nPost MDC migration of our project, the selected options have started coming in blue color (mat-selected class getting added) which is fine. But since there is a custom function written for this clear-icon-click, although we set the control value to null/undefined and the value is updated properly in the control, still the selected classes are not getting removed. So, even if there is no option selected, the previously selected option still has the selected classes, when dropdown is opened. I used the hideSingleSelectionIndicator, hence tick is not present.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1736f4b7-3c57-43f5-819e-5d6ada9d6b0e)\n\nTo counter this, I used the below code in my clear function : \n\n`this.autocompleteRef?.options.find((data: MatOption) => data.selected)?.deselect();`\n\nNow, on clearing the field, the field gets cleared properly and the 'selected-related' classes are removed from that option in the dropdown but a flickering thing happening. \n\n### How can we avoid it ??? \n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Click on the field to open the drodown panel.\n2. Select the first option from the dropdown. (cause this only happens with the first option)\n3. Again try to click on the field so that dropdown opens with only that option in the dropdown.\n4. While the dropdown panel is in opened state, click on the clear icon. It flickers the dropdown.\n\nBelow is the example:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e42ae5-14ff-40e3-8be9-bec6fcb78157\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOn clear icon click, it should re-open the dropdown with all the options without any flickering\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn clear icon click, there is a flicker in the dropdown section and the autocomplete dropdown panel ultimately gets closed.\n\n### Environment\n\n- \"@angular/forms\": \"16.2.12\",\n- \"@angular/material\": \"16.2.14\",\n- \"@angular/cdk\": \"16.2.14\",\n- Browser(s): Chrome\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30721","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-autocomplete): Removing the selected option manually adds a flicker in the dropdown rendering.\" (#30721)"},{"Id":"2949520096","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T12:57:19","Actor":"angelaki","Number":"30720","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(mat-table): Table not refreshing on nested detail-row column change","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nI'm not sure if this scenario is supported by the API at all but imho it should be a valid scenario.\n\nIf I have an array of detail rows changing their columns does not automatically redraw the table. If I know all the rows in advance (do not use `@for`) it works as expected.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/av2ud5lm\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Clicking **Toggle Secondary** changes the json-output but not the table\n2. Only on clicking **Toggle Primary** the table gets redrawn, respecting the current definition for the detail rows\n\nWorking StackBlitz link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/av2ud5lm-ardwk8i8\nJust to make sure this also happens if all the rows are in a single array (https://stackblitz.com/edit/av2ud5lm-yhdxrfqp)\n\nNot this being a Q/A but just out of curiosity, why do I need `multiTemplateDataRows` at all? Why won't all (matching) rows get displayed by default? Asking since I tend to always use / set it but guess there might be some kind of disadvantage since this is not the default behavior?\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEven generic detail rows (created by `@for`) should behave correct.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nRight now, I need to know all my detail rows in advance. Since I'm implementing a pretty customizable table, I want to let the user create / define the rows in runtime.\n\nIf you're not going to support this case officially, a neat workaround to trigger redrawing the table would be welcome.\n\n### Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.1.9\nNode: 22.11.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.6.2\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.8\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n... service-worker\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1901.9 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.1.9\n@angular-devkit/core              19.1.9 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.1.9 (cli-only)\n@angular/cdk                      19.1.5\n@angular/cli                      19.1.9\n@angular/material                 19.1.5\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.1.5\n@schematics/angular               19.1.9 (cli-only)\nrxjs                              7.8.2\ntypescript                        5.7.3\nzone.js                           0.15.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/30720","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(mat-table): Table not refreshing on nested detail-row column change\" (#30720)"},{"Id":"2949319462","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:58:41","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30719","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30719","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v20.0.0-next.4\" with changelog.\" (#30719)"},{"Id":"2949296109","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:48:46","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30718","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: release notes for the v19.2.7 release","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-picks the changelog from the \"19.2.x\" branch to the next branch (main).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30718","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: release notes for the v19.2.7 release\" (#30718)"},{"Id":"2949291202","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:45:35","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"30717","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump version to \"v19.2.7\" with changelog.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/30717","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump version to \"v19.2.7\" with changelog.\" (#30717)"},{"Id":"2949220665","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-26T11:30:55","Actor":"mistrykaran91","Number":"30716","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/form-field): update text field styles for better alignment and overflow handling","State":"closed","Body":"Currently, `mat-label` overlaps `mat-suffix` in cases for `outline` and `fill` appearance.

Here's a snippet of the code in the Angular service method to get data:\r\n\r\npublic getProfileSettings() {\r\n  return this.http.get(`${this.configService.Config.api}userprofile/profile-settings`).pipe(\r\n    map((response: any) => {\r\n      // my code\r\n      return response;\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn the constructor of the userprofile page, I have something like this:\r\n\r\nthis.clientPanelService.getProfileSettings().subscribe((response) => {\r\n  // fetching data from the backend\r\n});\r\n\r\nOn the userprofile page, I update the data using a POST request. After navigating to another page and then returning to the userprofile page, the getProfileSettings() method is triggered again, but it returns the old cached data from before the update. How can I disable caching for this GET request? This issue started occurring after I updated my Angular application from version 13 to 14.\r\n\r\nEven though I added the headers Cache-Control and Pragma on the server-side C# code, it doesn't seem to help. It looks like the issue may be on the Angular side, as Angular may also have caching headers set that need to be overridden.\r\n\r\nMy response headers:\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, DELETE, OPTIONS\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:4200\r\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate\r\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\r\nDate: Mon, 10 Apr 2023 20:09:26 GMT\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nServer: Kestrel\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\nrequest headers:\r\n\r\nGET /api/v1/userprofile/profile-settings HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/111.0\r\nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*\r\nAccept-Language: en\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\r\nOrigin: http://localhost:4200\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nReferer: http://localhost:4200/\r\nCookie: //cookies\r\nSec-Fetch-Dest: empty\r\nSec-Fetch-Mode: cors\r\nSec-Fetch-Site: same-site\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nCache-Control: no-cache\r\n\r\nThis issue is happening after updating Angular from version 13 to 15 (i checked also on 14 the same problem). If i revert this change back to version 13, everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nWhen inspecting the network tab in the browser's developer tools, there is no new request being made to fetch the data from the backend, but the Angular getProfileSettings() method is being executed and returning outdated data. There are no exceptions or errors, but the request is not returning the latest data, but rather the data that has been cached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n```true\r\nAngular CLI: 15.2.5\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.6.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.2.6\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1502.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.5\r\n@angular/cli                    15.2.5\r\n@nguniversal/builders           15.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/common             15.2.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     15.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.5\r\nng-packagr                      15.2.2\r\nrxjs                            7.8.0\r\ntypescript                      4.9.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49772","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"GET Requests Caching Issue\" (#49772)"},{"Id":"1661331272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T20:39:41","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"49771","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update minimum supported Node version from 16.13.0 -> 16.14.0","State":"open","Body":"This commit updates the minimum supported Node version across packages from 16.13.0 -> 16.14.0 to ensure compatibility with dependencies.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Build related changes\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49771","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update minimum supported Node version from 16.13.0 -> 16.14.0\" (#49771)"},{"Id":"1661248156","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T20:30:05","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"49770","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: move error pages outside of the `public-api` group","State":"closed","Body":"Currently, a change in an error guide triggers a review for the `public-api` group (requests 3 reviewers and al least 2 must approve).

That is, we don’t need to mark dirty to the root, because we’ve already traversed down to it. The function used to only be called during template execution for input bindings but was added to `setInput` later. It's not a good fit because it means that if you are responding to events such as an emit from an `Observable` and call `setInput`, the view of your `ComponentRef` won't necessarily get checked when change detection runs next. If this lives inside some `OnPush` component tree that's not already dirty, it only gets refreshed if you also call `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck` in the host component (because it will be \"shielded\" be a non-dirty parent).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49747","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): When using setInput, mark view dirty in same way as `markForCheck`\" (#49747)"},{"Id":"1661004695","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T19:24:26","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"49765","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: adding a note on comment nodes in the server-rendered output","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/49765","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: adding a note on comment nodes in the server-rendered output\" (#49765)"},{"Id":"1660896480","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T19:06:55","Actor":"goetzrobin","Number":"49762","RawContent":null,"Title":"v16.0.0-next.7 SSR replacing ngIf and ngFor directives with <!--container-->","State":"closed","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore, platform-server\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes\n\n### Description\n\nI have a project that is using a custom SSR setup (Analog and Nitro) to render my application on the server.\r\n\r\nIn v15.2.5 it successfully renders the list of notes that are provided by a resolver.\r\nThe HTML output from server looks like this:\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html class=\"dark h-full\" lang=\"en\">\r\n   <head>\r\n      <script type=\"module\" src=\"/@vite/client\"></script>\r\n      <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n      <title>SPARTAN -

Scrolling up (and up only) is causing the viewport content to disappear and reappear in a glitchy manner. This glitch only happens after scrolling to the BOTTOM of the content after resizing the viewport (or window if it snaps to it), and it persists until the user scrolls to the exact TOP of the viewport. After you scroll completely to the top (with the workaround implemented), the glitchy behavior stops, you can scroll up and down, even to the bottom, and it will work, until the viewport width is resized again, and then the glitch reappears.\r\n- The workaround-glitch does not start happening (nor the one without the workaround) until you actually scroll to the bottom. if you just scroll to the middle, etc, and then up, it behaves normally.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the workaround is not enough and results in horrible UX, especially with large datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Snippets:**\r\n\r\nTemplate:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport\r\n    #accordionVirtualScroller\r\n    autosize\r\n    [style.height]=\"isOutermostInstance ? '100%' : '500px'\"\r\n    (scroll)=\"checkViewportStuff($event)\"\r\n>\r\n    ... rendered a bunch of closed accordions etc ...\r\n</...>\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent:\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncheckViewportStuff($event: Event): void {\r\n    console.log('well, we scrolled');\r\n    const accordionWrapper = this.accordionVirtualScroller.elementRef.nativeElement;\r\n    const contentWrapper = accordionWrapper.querySelector('.cdk-virtual-scroll-content-wrapper') as HTMLElement;\r\n    if (!contentWrapper) return;\r\n\r\n    const transformStyle = contentWrapper.style.transform;\r\n\r\n    const translateYMatch = transformStyle.match(/translateY\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\r\n    if (translateYMatch && translateYMatch[1]) {\r\n        const translateY = parseFloat(translateYMatch[1]);\r\n        if (translateY < 0) {\r\n            console.log('OUT OF BOUNDS');\r\n            setTimeout(() => {\r\n                this.renderer.setStyle(contentWrapper, 'transform', 'translateY(0px)');\r\n                accordionWrapper.scrollTop = 0;\r\n            }, 100);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Implement the CDK virtual scroller with autosize enabled.\r\n2. Resize the viewport width to change the width of the virtual scroller.\r\n3. Scroll to the bottom of the content.\r\n4. Attempt to scroll back up.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n- Smooth scrolling without any visual glitches\r\n- No out-of-bound translateY values.\r\n- Correct scroll direction.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n- When scrolling back up from the bottom after resizing the viewport width, the translateY CSS property becomes negative and keeps getting lower and lower, causing the viewport content to disappear.\r\n- The viewport does not differentiate between the scroll wheel direction, it just keeps pushing the translateY further into an invalid value.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- **Angular:** 15.1.4, 15.2.5 (both versions tested, updated to see if it helps)\r\n- **CDK:** 15.1.4, 15.2.5 \r\n- **CDK-Experimental:** 15.1.4, 15.2.5 \r\n- **Browser(s):** Brave v1.49.132 (Chromium), Mozilla 111.0.1 (64-bit), likely all other browsers?\r\n- **Operating System:**: Windows 10 Enterprise 21H2\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/26882","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CDK Virtual Scroller (Experimental) Glitch after viewport width resize (or zoom in/out) and scrolling to the Bottom\" (#26882)"},{"Id":"1653102883","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-04T03:18:44","Actor":"zarend","Number":"26880","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug(slide-toggle): DOM order does not match visual order when slide toggle has `labelPosition=\"before\"`","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nDOM order does not match visual order when slide toggle has `labelPosition=\"before\"`\n\n### Reproduction\n\n  ```\r\n  \r\n          <mat-slide-toggle\r\n            labelPosition=\"before\"\r\n          >Activate</mat-slide-toggle>\r\n          \r\n         ```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDOM order matches visual order\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nlabel comes after the button in the DOM.

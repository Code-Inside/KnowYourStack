Reference: https://docs.imagekit.io/features/image-transformations/resize-crop-and-other-transformations#example-all-padding-on-one-side\r\n\r\nI think if we support the query parameter version of ImageKit, developers who use ImageKit would be able to add more transformations via query URL and just add the width by default via the loader function just like what ImgIX loader does.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b6e3840ed4f52b1fcf564cec642e63ddf358aab8/packages/common/src/directives/ng_optimized_image/image_loaders/imgix_loader.ts#L40-L45\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nSupport both ways of providing transformation parameters in URL path or query parameter. I also tested, using both query and path part in an image and it doesn't work. So just give the developer the option to use one of the two via configuration options.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nFor now, just create custom loader for ImageKit that passes transformation via query parameters","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48800","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support passing image transformation via query parameters in Image directive via ImageKit loader\" (#48800)"},{"Id":"1551069751","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-20T18:39:27","Actor":"devversion","Number":"48798","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(bazel): remove unnecessary banner stamping code","State":"closed","Body":"The `ng_package` rule supports replacing `0.0.0-PLACEHOLDER` in license files that are\r\ninserted as part of rollup.

This allows the main functionality of the package to be used without requiring any other Angular packages. Only the message digest algorithm implementation from the `@angular/compiler` package was being used and this code is now bundled directly into the final npm package for `@angular/localize`.\r\nThe `tooling` secondary entry point still leverages and requires Angular related packages (`@angular/compiler`/`@angular-compiler-cli`).

There's two methods of applying formControl to <input> element - via formControlName and [formControl].

In formControlName method it works as intended - it marks the option only inside one of the radioboxes. The situation differs in the second one, where it doesn't change the value in reactiveForms(radioBoxFCTwo is null), but still it is marked as checked in the html <input>.\r\n\r\nThe bug can be reproduced in Angular 14(local) and 15(stackblitz);

I then use the loadTranslations() method to load the file.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that when I run ng extract-i18n, the computeDigest() function generates the message id. When the application starts, loadTranslations() calls computeMsgId(), which generates message id in the same format as that rendered to \"simple JSON\" translation files when extracting messages. However, in my case, the extract generates different ids for the same string in xliff2 vs JSON formats, which is causing the warnings. (Not for all strings, but for some).\r\n\r\nI have created a JSON object from xliff 2 extracted messages and compared it to the one extracted with JSON, and there were a couple of discrepancies: \r\n\r\n1.\r\nFor the next template:\r\n```html\r\n<p>text {{ test1 }}</p>\r\n<p>text {{ test2 }}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nxliff2 extractor produced two records, while json extractor created only one record\r\n\r\n2.\r\nxliff 2 generates a different id compared to JSON for the same string in some cases. I have around 300 differences out of approx. 4500 strings. I looked through closed problems and saw that there was a problem with mapping for xliff 1.2 and some legacy id migration, but I am working with Angular 14 and xliff 2 format so I hoped this shouldn't be a problem anymore...\r\n\r\nAt this stage I can only see 2 solutions to my problem:\r\n1. Using simple JSON format during extract, which is not ideal for the translation team as it doesn't have context implemented.\r\n2. Using custom ids, which I am trying to avoid as it would require another pass through the code base.\r\n\r\nCould someone please verify that at this stage there is nothing else that can be done?\r\nIt just seems odd that the ids are different... \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\ntemplate.html:15 No translation found for \"7324656422629038198\" (\" No results found yet. \").\n```\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 14.2.5\r\nNode: 16.18.0\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.2.0 \r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 14.2.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------       \r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1402.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   14.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core            14.2.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      14.2.5\r\n@angular/cdk                    14.2.4\r\n@angular/material               14.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular             14.2.5\r\nrxjs                            7.5.7\r\ntypescript                      4.8.4\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48786","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"i18n: No translation found for \"id\"\" (#48786)"},{"Id":"1549924507","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-19T20:49:53","Actor":"JeanMeche","Number":"48785","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Use of $any() has no runtime incidence.","State":"open","Body":"Some users are woried about `$any()` as function calls are to be avoided in templates.

So this isn't a solution.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nBecause the user has the possibility to opt this feature out when the angular cli asks you if you want to enable the autocompletion and because there is an command to enable this without being asked there should also be to possibility to disable this feature with an command like\r\n\r\n`ng completion disable`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAs an alternative you could also make the global configuration settings\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"cli\": {\r\n    \"completion\": {\r\n      \"prompted\": true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nalso available in the `angular.json` file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24582","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide option to disable autocompletion\" (#24582)"},{"Id":"1550604635","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-20T10:15:24","Actor":"kaimmrt","Number":"24581","RawContent":null,"Title":"angular 15 how can I avoid long relative paths import","State":"closed","Body":"Angular 15\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to '@import 'variables.scss' like this instead of '@import '../../../assets/scss/variables.scss;'\r\n\r\nmy code in project.json file\r\n```\r\n   \"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\r\n                    \"includePaths\": [\"apps/client/src/assets/scss\",\"./node_modules\"]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get an error like this when I defined this short '@import 'variables.scss'\r\n\r\nError: Transform failed with 1 error:\r\nC:/my-project/home.component.scss:17: 100 : ERROR: Unterminated string token","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/24581","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"angular 15 how can I avoid long relative paths import\" (#24581)"},{"Id":"1550359182","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-20T06:15:27","Actor":"angular-robot","Number":"24579","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | `1a51e19` -> `d22f575` |\n| [@angular/cdk](https://togithub.com/angular/cdk-builds) | dependencies | digest | `2bf3551` -> `224a6b3` |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f0aec20` -> `2ed5561` |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | `22d0880` -> `d7c8aa6` |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | `693a884` -> `98ba5e5` |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | `f94125e` -> `f4f556e` |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | `374f124` -> `f2a7a74` |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | `78d703b` -> `6156a86` |\n| [@angular/localize](https://togithub.com/angular/localize-builds) | dependencies | digest | `755c1da` -> `5583bb5` |\n| [@angular/material](https://togithub.com/angular/material-builds) | dependencies | digest | `b4356c9` -> `5891051` |\n| [@angular/material-moment-adapter](https://togithub.com/angular/material-moment-adapter-builds) | dependencies | digest | `0e23c03` -> `50bba3f` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | `5064969` -> `6a2cc9e` |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | `ba881e0` -> `e769461` |\n| [@angular/platform-server](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-server-builds) | dependencies | digest | `573ba93` -> `cde67bc` |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | `389b737` -> `d4a8aae` |\n| [@angular/service-worker](https://togithub.com/angular/service-worker-builds) | dependencies | digest | `a31a972` -> `9fabe73` |\n\n🔡 If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

column that the cell belongs to.\r\n\r\nWhat it DOESN'T say is that if the column name has any symbols in it like dots or backslashes or anything that the [_setNameInput method in CdkColumnDef](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/623b0c94e90f83ba1a91d93137ebad6622e12bdd/src/cdk/table/cell.ts#L139) would consider not CSS friendly, the harness will instead return that column's name with all of the offending characters replaced with dashes\r\n\r\n**Example:** \r\n\r\nLet's say that I've defined row template as [per point 3 in MatTable's Getting Started](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview#3-define-the-row-templates) section, and one of the columns is called _\"bar.tar\"_\r\n\r\n`columnsToDisplay = ['foo', 'bar.tar'];`\r\n\r\nLater on I'm writing tests and using test harnesses to get a list of that table's columns\r\n\r\n```\r\n// cells is of type MatCellHarness[]\r\nconst columnNames = await parallel(() => cells.map(cell => cell.getColumnName()));\r\n// columnNames is ['foo', 'bar-tar']\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I understand, it's because the cell harness uses the [cell's own CSS class](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/31a754c90405ac3a21858cdd038d56aa7375fabc/src/material/table/testing/cell-harness.ts#L23) to deduct its column's name, which is fair enough, but I do strongly think that this behaviour should be documented\r\n\n\n### Affected documentation

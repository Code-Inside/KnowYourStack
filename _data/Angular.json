Version 0.14.2 does not have an issue.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be related to the fact that zone.js registers an \"abort\" handler on the AbortSignal object passed in to the addEventListener() call and the callback it is registering captures the task in its scope. This handler is as far as I can tell never removed off the AbortSignal object.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/zone.js-0.14.3/packages/zone.js/lib/common/events.ts#L488\r\n\r\nThe big issue I see with the current implementation is that zone.js has no clue what the lifetime and ownership model is for the AbortSignal object in question or the element that is captured in the task within the callback that is never removed.\r\n\r\nIn our particular case the detached HTMLElement captured within the task is part of a larger subtree that gets removed/detached. The signal itself is owned by some code associated with an ancestor element that out-lives the subtree that is removed, so as long as that listener callback is alive, so is the task, the element it captures, and any other elements in the detached subtree the element is still referencing via parentNode, next/prevSibling, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, we can't assume that this \"abort\" listener will be removed via a corresponding element's removeEventListener() call because there may never be a removeEventListener() call made ... and in most circumstances when a subtree of elements is detached, this would be ok and things would garbage collect just fine.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be observed with this simple test case:\r\n\r\n[addeventlistener-signal-bug.txt](https://github.com/angular/angular/files/14516929/addeventlistener-signal-bug.txt)\r\n\r\nIf you load the test case into Chrome:\r\n\r\n- Press the remove button in the test case\r\n- Open the Web Inspector Memory Panel\r\n- Hit the Garbage Collect button\r\n- Trigger a Heap Snapshot\r\n\r\nIn the resulting Heap Snapshot you will notice that there are detached HTMLDiv, HTMLButton, HTMLUL, and HTMLLI elements listed.\r\n\r\nIf you remove the include of zone.js from the test case, and then repeat the steps above, you will see that the elements mentioned above are no longer listed in the Heap Snapshot, meaning they were garbage collected properly.\r\n\r\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/54739","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"addEventListener with AbortSignal option can cause memory leaks\" (#54739)"},{"Id":"2172426224","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-06T23:44:12","Actor":"atscott","Number":"54735","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): Ensure views marked for check are refreshed during change …","State":"closed","Body":"…detection\r\n\r\nWhen a view has the `Dirty` flag and is reattached, we should ensure that it is reached and refreshed during the next change detection run from above.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when a view is created and attached, we should ensure that it is reached and refreshed during change detection. This can happen if the view is created and attached outside a change run or when it is created and attached after its insertion view was already checked.

The one identified internally was actually depending on change detection _not_ running immediately because it relied on an input value that was set using `ngModel`.

In rare circumstances, this correction can cause issues.

It has several flaws that make it an insufficient change detection mechanism:\r\n\r\n* It runs change detection for the component under test _after_ views attached to the `ApplicationRef`. This can cause real behavior differences that break in production, because tests can observe view refreshes in the incorrect order (for example, a dialog refreshing before the component which opened it).\r\n* Because of the above ordering, render hooks registered during change detection of the fixture views _will not execute at all_ because `ApplicationRef.tick` already happen.\r\n* It does not rerun change detection on the view tree if there are more dirty views to refresh after the render hooks complete.\r\n* It effectively hides/swallows errors from change detection inside the `onMicrotaskEmpty` subscription by not reporting them to the error handler. Instead, this error ends up being unhandled in the subscription and rxjs throws these in a `setTimeout`.\r\n\r\nAll of the above are problematic but this commit _does not_ fix the final point. Ideally, we can land this in a future change but this requires additional internal fixes. In the meantime, we have to juggle special-case handling of the component fixture views within `ApplicationRef.tick` using some special events to retain current behavior and avoid errors from the fixture propagating to the `ErrorHandler`.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: The `ComponentFixture.autoDetect` feature now executes change detection for the fixture within `ApplicationRef.tick`. This more closely matches the behavior of how a component would refresh in production. The order of component refresh in tests may be slightly affected as a result, especially when dealing with additional components attached to the application, such as dialogs. Tests sensitive to this type of change (such as screenshot tests) may need to be updated. Concretely, this change means that the component will refresh _before_ additional views attached to `ApplicationRef` (i.e. dialog components). Prior to this change, the fixture component would refresh _after_ other views attached to the application.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54733","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(core): ComponentFixture autodetect should detect changes within A…\" (#54733)"},{"Id":"2172440858","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-06T21:26:34","Actor":"atscott","Number":"54737","RawContent":null,"Title":"release: bump the next branch to v18.0.0-next.0","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54737","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"release: bump the next branch to v18.0.0-next.0\" (#54737)"},{"Id":"2172295213","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-06T19:44:52","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"54730","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update next branch to reflect new release-train \"v17.4.0-next.0\".","State":"closed","Body":"The previous \"next\" release-train has moved into the release-candidate phase.

This breaks a development configuration that has worked since the beginning of angular-cli. As explained [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27152#issuecomment-1979033125), the rationale for this removal seems to be that no one should have been using `deployUrl` with `dev-server`, and that it was being set erroneously with the webpack server as well. I commented on this in the pull request, but now that this has been released, it seemed that a bug report made sense.\r\n\r\nOur use case, as I understand it, requires using `deployUrl` for serving with `dev-server`. If I am mistaken, I'd be happy to change our developer configuration accordingly, but I don't see how we can use `dev-server` without `deploy-url`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nOur use case is as follows: In production, our application contains hybrid between an older, non-Angular parts and updated Angular parts. It is served primarily from an nginx/php server we'll call `example.com`. The angular code is build and served (with `deployUrl`) from a CDN. So, for example, a user might load `https://example.com/foo`, which might be an angular page (the php server will return the angular `index.html`, which then loads the rest of the angular from the CDN, due to `deployUrl`), and then click over to `https://example.com/bar`, which might be an old non-angular page, and thus will be served directly by the php server. It all works seamlessly to the user.\r\n\r\nOur development environments mirror our production environment.  Each developer has a remote development server, e.g., `dev-devname.example.com`. Instead of deploying the fully compiled angular code to a CDN, each developer runs `ng serve` locally from localhost:4200. `deployUrl` is set to `//localhost:4200`, and we `rsync` a copy of `index.html` over to the dev server so that it can be served by our php application when appropriate. `localhost` acts exactly like the CDN in this scenario, and `deployUrl` is what makes it work. The developer loads, for example, `https://dev-devname.example.com/foo`, php serves up `index.html`, and Angular is loaded from `localhost` (our fake CDN, in this case).\r\n\r\nThis has worked well for us since Angular CLI was introduced, and, except for a small, easily remedied issue with the url for the vite server( #27152), worked well when we transitioned from webpack to the `es-build` server. I was super happy to see that `deployUrl` was being added for the `application` builder as well, and I hope that this issue can be resolved so that we can continue to keep up with the latest Angular improvements!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 17.2.3\r\nNode: 18.18.2\r\nPackage Manager: yarn 1.22.19\r\nOS: darwin arm64\r\n\r\nAngular: 17.2.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1702.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   17.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core            17.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      17.2.3\r\n@angular/cdk                    17.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular             17.2.3\r\nrxjs                            7.8.1\r\ntypescript                      5.3.3\r\nzone.js                         0.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27224","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disabling deployUrl with dev-server breaks existing use case\" (#27224)"},{"Id":"2173458637","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-07T10:19:14","Actor":"guilhermebentomarques","Number":"27234","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prerender not generating files when strict mode is true","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\r\n\r\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I run the command \r\n\r\n`node --max_old_space_size=8192 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng run ui:prerender:qa`\r\n\r\nWith the following config\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"prerender\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@nguniversal/builders:prerender\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"guessRoutes\": false,\r\n            \"browserTarget\": \"ui:browser\",\r\n            \"serverTarget\": \"ui:server\",\r\n            \"routesFile\": \"./src/prerender-routes.txt\",\r\n            \"numProcesses\": 4\r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n            \"production\": {\r\n              \"browserTarget\": \"ui:browser:production\",\r\n              \"serverTarget\": \"ui:server:production\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"qa\": {\r\n              \"browserTarget\": \"ui:browser:qa\",\r\n              \"serverTarget\": \"ui:server:qa\"\r\n            },\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n        \r\nThe prerender-routes.txt has only one line (for test)\r\n       \r\n` /about-us`\r\n\r\nThe step of prerendering routes never happpen.\r\n\r\ntsconfig file with strict true.\r\n\r\n`\"strict\": true,`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/10928446/d66f1b89-3f1a-4fe7-a5da-2f888d7fee0b)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when the tsconfig file with strict false, everything works fine.\r\n\r\n`\"strict\": false,`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/assets/10928446/6c0b1372-7faf-4b32-af9b-be4f4a572804)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nnode --max_old_space_size=8192 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng run ui:prerender\r\n\r\n### Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nThere is no error or exception the process just finishes without prerendering the files with I'm using strict mode.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAngular CLI: 15.1.2\r\nNode: 18.19.1\r\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 15.1.1\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1501.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            15.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      15.2.10\r\n@angular/cli                    15.1.2\r\n@nguniversal/builders           15.1.0\r\n@nguniversal/common             15.1.0\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine     15.1.0\r\n@schematics/angular             15.2.10\r\nrxjs                            7.5.5\r\ntypescript                      4.9.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n\r\nIs there any way that I can know the reason that the files are not being generated?

This works fine if the user navigates by keyboard, and if the user try to go outside the dialog because the backdrop capture mouse clicks. But if the user goes to the browser chrome, like the URL bar, and then navigates with the keyboard to the page content, the focus is transferred to elements behind the dialog, making the dialog ineffective.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug in the dialog implementation because I display another kind of dialogs, using a custom CDK's Overlay and ConfigurableFocusTrapFactory and it can capture this kind of navigation, so this bug doesn't look like part of the focus trap implementation.\r\n\r\nThis is what I do that works fine on my custom dialog based on CDK's Overlay:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nconst focusTrap = this.focusTrapFactory.create(containerElem);\r\nfocusTrap.focusInitialElementWhenReady();\r\noverlayRef.detachments().subscribe(() => focusTrap.destroy());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Maybe start implementing the dialog component on top of the dialog element could help avoid having to use focus traps, when browser compatibility requirements allows for it.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

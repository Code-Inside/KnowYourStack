Too often we found ourselves in a situation where nobody understood what\r\nmotivated some of the changes and we needed more contextual info to know if the\r\nchange was correct, desirable, and still relevant (at a later point in time).\r\n\r\nWhen the limit was introduced, we needed to pick a minimum body length - given no\r\ndata, and frustration with even big changes being committed with just a words in\r\nthe subject (along the lines of \"fix(core): fixing a bug\"), we overcompensated\r\nand started off with a really high bar of minBodyLength set to 100 chars.\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be impractical and created a big friction point in making valid\r\nchanges in the angular/angular repo, and in fact caused some of the refactorings\r\nand smaller changes to be either skipped or combined into other commits which\r\nincreased the burden for code reviewers.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in the friction points can be seen in the number of PRs that fail to pass\r\nthe current lint check on the first try, but more importantly also in the \"creative\"\r\nwriting that some of the committers are forced to resort to in order to satisfy the\r\ncurrent checks.

At first I thought I must be doing something very obvious wrong, but I was able to reproduce the problem with a very simple component using the out-of-the-box configuration generated by `ng new --strict` at the latest version.\r\n\r\nI searched online, and I was surprised to be unable to find any references to this problem. I did find a couple of similar-looking issues where errors in a template did not result in the test failures one would expect, but these are for non-existent HTML elements:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36171\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36430\r\n\r\nSo either this is a different but similar-looking problem, or these previously-reported problems are broader than these existing issues suggest. I tried setting `enableIvy = false` in my repro (see below), and it made no difference, so this problem does not appear to be Ivy-specific; since the issues above do appear to be Ivy-specific, I suspect this is a different problem.\r\n\r\nEither way, such significant discrepancies between test and non-test behaviours raise concerns about the usefulness of Angular tests for ensuring the code quality of components.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created the following GitHub repository to reproduce this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/amdw/templates-test-repro\r\n\r\nThere are two branches, `master` and `nonstrict`. In both cases, `ng serve` fails with a compile error, but `ng test` succeeds, despite the fact that the tests compile the broken `MyComponent` and make assertions about the contents of its DOM.\r\n\r\nI would expect both commands to fail with a compile error - or at the very least, this behavioural discrepancy should be prominently mentioned in testing-related documentation [such as this](https://angular.io/guide/testing#component-test-scenarios), with a description of how tests can be configured to have the same compilation behaviour as these other workflows.\r\n\r\nThe `master` branch just uses the default compiler settings generated by `ng new --strict`. `MyComponent` has an incorrect HTML template: `myinput` can be undefined according to the component type signature, but one of its fields is being unconditionally dereferenced. Running `ng serve` or `ng build` results in a compile error, as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in src/app/mycomponent/mycomponent.component.html:7:27 - error TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever `ng test` results in 100% success, with no mention in the logs that there is any problem at all.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought this might be a problem with the new-ish `strictTemplates` settings, since that is the context in which I discovered the problem (I was trying to convert an existing application to use `strictTemplates`; I got to a stage where my tests were 100% green, and thought I must be nearly done, but when I ran `ng serve` I got a flood of errors caused by type-checking failures in my HTML templates).\r\n\r\nHowever, I did a little more experimentation and found that is not the case. The `nonstrict` branch switches `strictTemplates` and `strictInjectionParameters` to `false`, and introduces another template error, referencing a component attribute which does not even exist. Once again, `ng build` and `ng serve` result in the expected failures:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/app/mycomponent/mycomponent.component.html:6:39 - error TS2339: Property 'nonexistent' does not exist on type 'MycomponentComponent'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, once again, `ng test` results in 100% success.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nN/A - the problem is that tests pass when I believe they shouldn't.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 10.0.1\r\nNode: 12.16.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.0.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.1000.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              10.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        10.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      10.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  10.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               10.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.1000.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.9.6\r\nwebpack                           4.43.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of anything.

Perhaps I can look into making a PR if you are okay with this idea.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37942","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow caching of NGCC files for CI/CD using npm ci\" (#37942)"},{"Id":"651575848","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-06T14:15:54","Actor":"pspkshah","Number":"37941","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 10: Runtime Error Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstCreatePass' of null","State":"open","Body":"After upgrading from Angular 9 to 10, I am getting below error on runtime for a child component.\r\n\r\nI can reach component, but it fails to bind for [(ngModel)] property and giving below error\r\n\r\n**Stack Trace**\r\n\r\nError: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstCreatePass' of null\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'firstCreatePass' of null\r\n    at providersResolver (core.js:27050)\r\n    at Object.definition.providersResolver (core.js:27382)\r\n    at resolveDirectives (core.js:7869)\r\n    at elementStartFirstCreatePass (core.js:13817)\r\n    at Module.ɵɵelementStart (core.js:13855)\r\n    at ProductFormComponent_Template (product-form.component.html:17)\r\n    at executeTemplate (core.js:7329)\r\n    at renderView (core.js:7138)\r\n    at renderComponent (core.js:8382)\r\n    at renderChildComponents (core.js:6997)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone-evergreen.js:798)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone-evergreen.js:750)\r\n    at zone-evergreen.js:860\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:399)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.js:27126)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:398)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone-evergreen.js:167)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone-evergreen.js:569)\r\n    at invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:484)\r\n    at ZoneTask.invoke (zone-evergreen.js:469)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 10: Runtime Error Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstCreatePass' of null\" (#37941)"},{"Id":"651529418","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-06T13:15:27","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"37940","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove duplicated WrappedValue class","State":"open","Body":"Before this refactoring we had the WrappedValue class in\r\n2 separate places:\r\n- packages/core/src/change_detection/change_detection_util.ts\r\n- packages/core/src/util/WrappedValue.ts\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the duplicate, leaving the class that has\r\nthe deprecation notice.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37940","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): remove duplicated WrappedValue class\" (#37940)"},{"Id":"650826894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-06T12:34:22","Actor":"bbolek","Number":"37921","RawContent":null,"Title":"LBP has incorrect decimal places","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/core\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> As I tested 9.1.1 and 10, this does not work in both.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrencies are formatted according to [ISO_4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

Afer upgrading to >=NG9.0.7 the compiler gets stripped away in production mode by optimization. This is an issue since it breaks any app depending on runtime compilation.\r\n\r\nThe possible solutions presented in the error are pretty \"weird\":\r\n\r\n1. \"JIT compilation is discouraged for production use-cases! Consider AOT mode instead.\"\r\nYeah, no shit sherlock 😄 as I stated above, the templates that are compiled at runtime are not known at AOT build time.\r\nThe statement sounds a little bit like \"Angular is AOT only so get rid of your dynamic stuff\".\r\n\r\n2. \"Alternatively provide the compiler with 'import \"@angular/compiler\";' before bootstrapping\"\r\nThis would be great but does not work. Tried importing it in main.ts or even polyfills.ts\r\n\r\nCurrently we have no way of getting back our much needed runtime compiler.\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated!\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-ivy\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n[https://github.com/FSDRE/ngcompile](https://github.com/FSDRE/ngcompile)\r\n\r\n* See `main.ts`, compiler gets imported\r\n* `npm run startProd` -> Error in the browser...\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.\r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nERROR Error: Angular JIT compilation failed: '@angular/compiler' not loaded!\r\n  - JIT compilation is discouraged for production use-cases!

For example, `#/external/play-it-now` would result in `GuestComponent` being rendered (for the wildcard route), which in turn would pick up `PlayComponent` from the dynamic components API and render it to screen (via `ComponentFactoryResolver` and friends).\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nsee above.

And it's still a common practice in a lot of codebases...\n\nI hoped that pushing a new item to an array inside a signal, would trigger the computed signal.\nObviously I see now that since the reference of the array object stays the same, \nI have to use .slice() or some other means to create a new array instance after every signal.update(...).\nWhile that is a solution, i hoped that using the custom equality option i could equate the actual array content or length before and after the change,\nthus making the code cleaner, even though the framework would need to work a little harder to find out if its the same or not...\n\nProblem is, I found out that if I only mutate the array and not create a new instance (ie items.push(...); return items;) ,\nthe custom equal function gets the same object as as the \"a\" and \"b\" parameters... \nApparently the framework didn't save an old copy of the signal value before the change, and there is no way to know that it's changed.\n\nI realize this could make things more complicated and might not make sense performance-wise, \nbut i decided to raise the issue for your consideration, since it could make sense in certain applications, and since Signals are still being in dev preview...\n\nI put up a stackblitz reproducing this issue.\n\nThanks a lot!!!\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ta7t5b?file=src%2Fmain.ts\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.7\nNode: 18.20.3\nPackage Manager: npm 10.2.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.7\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.7\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.7\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.7\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.7\n@schematics/angular             18.2.7\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58429","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Trigger computed signals on mutated value using custom equality\" (#58429)"},{"Id":"2624371252","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-30T14:53:08","Actor":"jzolnowski","Number":"58428","RawContent":null,"Title":"Automating Component Dependency Imports in Angular","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nAutomating the import of necessary component dependencies would significantly enhance developer productivity and reduce repetitive code.\n\nCurrently, developers are required to manually create an array of essential dependencies that need to be imported for a component to function properly. This process can be tedious and error-prone, as it requires developers to remember which dependencies are necessary and add them to the imports array themselves.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIs it possible for Angular to automate this process by generating the imports array based on the component class (using ES6 imports) and the associated template?\n\nFor instance, consider the following component:\n\n```\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\nimport { Component, inject, signal, ChangeDetectionStrategy, viewChild } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormControl, ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';\nimport { MatChipsModule } from '@angular/material/chips';\nimport { MatDialog } from '@angular/material/dialog';\nimport { MatFormFieldModule } from '@angular/material/form-field';\nimport { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon';\nimport { MatInputModule } from '@angular/material/input';\nimport { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu';\nimport { MatPaginator, MatPaginatorModule } from '@angular/material/paginator';\nimport { MatProgressSpinnerModule } from '@angular/material/progress-spinner';\nimport { MatSnackBar } from '@angular/material/snack-bar';\nimport { MatTableDataSource, MatTableModule } from '@angular/material/table';\nimport { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar';\nimport { MatTooltipModule } from '@angular/material/tooltip';\nimport { Params, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-user-list',\n  imports: [\n    CommonModule,\n    MatTableModule,\n    MatPaginatorModule,\n    MatFormFieldModule,\n    MatInputModule,\n    MatToolbarModule,\n    MatProgressSpinnerModule,\n    MatButtonModule,\n    MatIconModule,\n    RouterModule,\n    MatTooltipModule,\n    MatChipsModule,\n    MatMenuModule,\n    ReactiveFormsModule,\n  ],\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n  templateUrl: './user-list.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./user-list.component.scss'],\n})\nexport class UserListComponent {}\n```\n\nThis component could be defined without manually listing the imports array, reducing redundancy:\n\n```\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\nimport { Component, inject, signal, ChangeDetectionStrategy, viewChild } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormControl, ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';\nimport { MatChipsModule } from '@angular/material/chips';\nimport { MatDialog } from '@angular/material/dialog';\nimport { MatFormFieldModule } from '@angular/material/form-field';\nimport { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon';\nimport { MatInputModule } from '@angular/material/input';\nimport { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu';\nimport { MatPaginator, MatPaginatorModule } from '@angular/material/paginator';\nimport { MatProgressSpinnerModule } from '@angular/material/progress-spinner';\nimport { MatSnackBar } from '@angular/material/snack-bar';\nimport { MatTableDataSource, MatTableModule } from '@angular/material/table';\nimport { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar';\nimport { MatTooltipModule } from '@angular/material/tooltip';\nimport { Params, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-user-list',\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n  templateUrl: './user-list.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./user-list.component.scss'],\n})\nexport class UserListComponent {}\n\n```\n\nCurrently, a significant amount of code is duplicated, and developers must remember to add the necessary dependencies to the imports array manually. Automating this process would streamline development, minimize errors, and allow developers to focus on building features rather than managing boilerplate code.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Provide an `Angular CLI` command that scans component files and generates the required imports automatically.\n- Create an IDE or editor extension that assists developers in identifying and adding required imports as they code.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/58428","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Automating Component Dependency Imports in Angular\" (#58428)"},{"Id":"2623569892","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-30T10:19:40","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"58427","RawContent":null,"Title":"Internal inject migration fixes","State":"open","Body":"Includes another batch of fixes for the internal `inject` migration.\r\n\r\n### refactor(migrations): internal inject migration applying some changes to abstract classes\r\nWe were filtering out abstract classes pretty late in the migration which led to the internal part of it to make some changes that aren't finalized later.

The 22.x release line now moves into \"Active LTS\"\nand will remain so until October 2025. After that time, it will move into\n\"Maintenance\" until end of life in April 2027.\n\nOther than updating metadata, such as the `process.release` object, to reflect\nthat the release is LTS, no further changes from Node.js 22.10.0 are included.\n\n##### OpenSSL 3.x\n\nOfficial binaries for Node.js 22.x currently include OpenSSL 3.0.x (more\nspecifically, the [quictls OpenSSL fork](https://redirect.github.com/quictls/openssl)).\nOpenSSL 3.0.x is the currently designated long term support version that is\nscheduled to be supported until 7th September 2026, which is within the expected\nlifetime of Node.js 22.x. We are expecting upstream OpenSSL to announce a\nsuccessor long term support version prior to that date and since OpenSSL now\nfollows a semantic versioning-like versioning scheme we expect to be able to\nupdate to the next long term supported version of OpenSSL during the lifetime of\nNode.js 22.x.\n\n### [`v22.10.0`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.10.0): 2024-10-16, Version 22.10.0 (Current), @&#8203;aduh95\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/compare/v22.9.0...v22.10.0)\n\n##### Notable Changes\n\n##### New `\"module-sync\"` exports condition\n\nThis release introduces a `\"module-sync\"` exports condition that's enabled when\n`require(esm)` is enabled, so packages can supply a synchronous ES module to the\nNode.js module loader, no matter if it's being required or imported. This is\nsimilar to the `\"module\"` condition that bundlers have been using to support\n`require(esm)` in Node.js, and allows dual-package authors to opt into ESM-first\nonly on newer versions of Node.js that supports `require(esm)` to avoid the\ndual-package hazard.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"node\": {\n      // On new version of Node.js, both require() and import get\n      // the ESM version\n      \"module-sync\": \"./index.js\",\n      // On older version of Node.js, where \"module-sync\" and require(esm) are\n      // not supported, use the CJS version to avoid dual-package hazard.\n      // When package authors think it's time to drop support for older versions of\n      // Node.js, they can remove the exports conditions and just use \"main\": \"index.js\".\n      \"default\": \"./dist/index.cjs\"\n    },\n    // On any other environment, use the ESM version.\n    \"default\": \"./index.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr if the package is only meant to be run on Node.js and wants to fallback to\nCJS on older versions that don't have `require(esm)`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    // On new version of Node.js, both require() and import get the ESM version\n    \"module-sync\": \"./index.js\",\n    // On older version of Node.js, where \"module-sync\" and require(esm) are\n    // not supported, use the CJS version to avoid dual-package hazard.\n    // When package authors think it's time to drop support for older versions of\n    // Node.js, they can remove the exports conditions and just use \"main\": \"index.js\".\n    \"default\": \"./dist/index.cjs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**For package authors**: this only serves as a feature-detection mechanism for\npackages that wish to support both CJS and ESM users during the period when some\nactive Node.js LTS versions support  `require(esm)` while some older ones don't.\nWhen all active Node.js LTS lines support `require(esm)`, packages can simplify\ntheir distributions by bumping the major version, dropping their CJS exports,\nand removing the `module-sync` exports condition (with only `main` or `default`\ntargetting the ESM exports). If the package needs to support both bundlers and\nbeing run unbundled on Node.js during the transition period, use both\n`module-sync` and `module` and point them to the same ESM file. If the package\nalready doesn't want to support older versions of Node.js that doesn't support\n`require(esm)`, don't use this export condition.\n\n**For bundlers/tools**: they should avoid implementing this stop-gap condition.\nMost existing bundlers implement the de-facto bundler standard\n[`module`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/package-exports/#providing-commonjs-and-esm-version-stateless)\nexports condition, and that should be enough to support users who want to bundle\nESM from CJS consumers. Users who want both bundlers and Node.js to recognize\nthe ESM exports can use both `module`/`module-sync` conditions during the\ntransition period, and can drop `module-sync`+`module` when they no longer need\nto support older versions of Node.js. If tools do want to support this\ncondition, it's recommended to make the resolution rules in the graph pointed by\nthis condition match the Node.js native ESM rules to avoid divergence.\n\nWe ended up implementing a condition with a different name instead of reusing\n`\"module\"`, because existing code in the ecosystem using the `\"module\"`\ncondition sometimes also expect the module resolution for these ESM files to\nwork in CJS style, which is supported by bundlers, but the native Node.js loader\nhas intentionally made ESM resolution different from CJS resolution (e.g.\nforbidding `import './noext'` or `import './directory'`), so it would be\nbreaking to implement a `\"module\"` condition without implementing the forbidden\nESM resolution rules. For now, this just implements a new condition as\nsemver-minor so it can be backported to older LTS.\n\nContributed by Joyee Cheung in [#&#8203;54648](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54648).\n\n##### `node --run` is now stable\n\nThis CLI flag runs a specified command from a `package.json`'s `\"scripts\"` object.\n\nFor the following `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"node --test-reporter junit --test ./test\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can run `node --run test` and that would start the test suite.\n\nContributed by Yagiz Nizipli in [#&#8203;53763](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53763).\n\n##### Other notable changes\n\n-   \\[[`f0b441230a`](https://redirect.github.com/nodejs/node/commit/f0b441230a)] -

If not doing so it might happen that prerendering fails when e.g. the url is either invalid, unreachable or does not return JSON. In this you'll get an error which doesn't really tell you a lot of context what is going on:\n\n```\n✘ [ERROR] An error occurred while prerendering route '/test'.\n\nundefined\n```\n\nMy expectation is that there should be some better error message to tell the user what (s)he is doing wrong.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Set up a project with SSR and routing enabled\n2. add router-outlet to the app.component\n3. set up some routing, e.g.\n```\n  {\n    path: 'test',\n    component: TestComponent,\n  },\n  {\n    path: '',\n    redirectTo: '/test',\n    pathMatch: 'full',\n  }\n```\n4. In a component of any route (in this case the TestComponent), set up an http call like:\n```\nconstructor(private http: HttpClient) {\n    this.http\n      .get('htp://invalid.url')\n      .subscribe();\n  }\n```\n5. run ng build\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n✘ [ERROR] An error occurred while prerendering route '/test'.\n\nundefined\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 18.2.10\nNode: 22.9.0\nPackage Manager: npm 10.8.3\nOS: linux x64\n\nAngular: 18.2.9\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\n... router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1802.10\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/core            18.2.10\n@angular-devkit/schematics      18.2.10\n@angular/cli                    18.2.10\n@angular/ssr                    18.2.10\n@schematics/angular             18.2.10\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.5.4\nzone.js                         0.14.10\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28740","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Prerendering fails with undefined stack trace on invalid http calls\" (#28740)"},{"Id":"2623362792","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-30T14:26:11","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28744","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/build): show error message when error stack is undefined","State":"closed","Body":"Handle cases where the error stack is missing by displaying a relevant message.\r\n\r\nCloses #28740\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28744","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/build): show error message when error stack is undefined\" (#28744)"},{"Id":"2622672524","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-30T06:19:08","Actor":"muuvmuuv","Number":"28742","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular/build – indexHtmlTransformer is missing in buildApplication","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\nbuild\n\n### Description\n\nI am currently trying to prepare `@angular-builders/custom-esbuild` for NG19 and saw that `@angular/build` `buildApplication` has no `indexHtmlTransformer` like dev-server has.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSame `extensions` for `buildApplication` as for dev-server's `execute`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28742","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@angular/build – indexHtmlTransformer is missing in buildApplication\" (#28742)"},{"Id":"2618855786","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T17:19:43","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"28730","RawContent":null,"Title":"Karma builder doesn't watch files with \"builderMode: application\"","State":"closed","Body":"### Command\n\ntest\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nUsing the `\"builderMode\": \"application\",` option in the Karam builder breaks `ng test` watch capabilities\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a new project with `npx @angular/cli@19.0.0-next.13 new karma-watch --defaults --no-routing`\nAdd `\"builderMode\": \"application\",` to `angular.json` in the `karma`options.\nLaunch `ng test`\nUpdate any file of the project like `app.component.ts` or `app.component.spec.ts`: the tests don't run again.\n\n### Exception or Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Environment\n\nAngular CLI: 19.0.0-next.13\nNode: 20.13.1\nPackage Manager: npm 9.7.1\nOS: darwin arm64\n\nAngular: 19.0.0-next.11\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n\nPackage                         Version\n---------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1900.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   19.0.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/core            19.0.0-next.13\n@angular-devkit/schematics      19.0.0-next.13\n@angular/cli                    19.0.0-next.13\n@schematics/angular             19.0.0-next.13\nrxjs                            7.8.1\ntypescript                      5.6.3\nzone.js                         0.15.0\n\n### Anything else relevant?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28730","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Karma builder doesn't watch files with \"builderMode: application\"\" (#28730)"},{"Id":"2621850765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T17:19:42","Actor":"jkrems","Number":"28739","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): fix --watch regression in karma","State":"closed","Body":"Outside of single-run mode, the karma test provider was expected to watch for changes.

This allowed to propagate values via injection token retrieved in `server.ts` to the application. \n\nNot knowing if there is a better approach, those values usually are:\n- configurations that must be available also in the angular application. Those values are always present during SSR and sometimes are needed also on the browser, so TransferState is needed to propagate them\n  - [app.config.ts](https://github.com/riccardoperra/angular-ssr-repro/blob/aa7b0c50698d981d52446a3043a594d6b69ea21b/18-ssr/src/app/app.config.ts#L16) : example of a token always valuated in both ssr and browser\n- server only object that allow to update the request data (e.g. update response headers / status code) / redirect\n  - Main use cases are for example the possibility to change the page status to 404 if the requested resource does not exist, preserving navigation.\n- static values that must be fetched only on server bootstrap and reused across all requests.\n\nAn important use case is that those value **could be used** into other application-level providers, in order to configurate them based on the request providers.\n\nWith the new `AngularAppEngine` in v19, I saw from @JeanMeche reproduction that you can pass custom values into the `requestContext` parameter when you render the app ([server.ts](https://github.com/JeanMeche/ssr-v19/blob/eef03da8ab1d2836b135e32f041b62fdb698a9f5/server.ts#L39)), however I have noticed some unusual behaviors that make me think I can't do the same things:\n\n- Those values are not always valuated. It seems that there is a case (the first request?) where those values are null.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ec5320-9ed8-4c1c-9184-1d49edbc352f)\n\nLike the screenshot above, (reproducible with `npm run start` into the v19-ssr folder), after the server, the log just show that the first request invoke 2 time the application bootstrap: the first time values in request context (inject via `REQUEST_CONTEXT` token) are null, the second one are valuated. This is critical since the first time an error is thrown, the application breaks.\n\n- Cannot modify request headers/status: with the new native `Response` object, it seems that we are not allowed anymore to update it imperatively into the angular application.

However while I was able to successfully migrate to levelAccessor, I run into an issue when using (mouseenter) at mat-tree-node, and at mat-nested-tree-node. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nStackBlitz link:  https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-vkc5ug?file=src%2Fexamples%2Fmateriral-level-accessor-tree.compononet.ts\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.  Go to Vegetables, Green, Broccoli\n2. Check the console.log while hovering from Broccoli, Green, Vegetables\n3. **The console.log inside onMouseEnter is not printed**\n4. When you hover from Vegetables, Green, Broccoli the console.log onMouseEnter is printed\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behaviour is that when the user hovers from a child node to parent node, then this event should be able to trigger on the parent node. Note that the other way around works perfectly fine (When user hovers from parent node to child node)\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmouseenter event is not triggered when hovering from child node to parent node. Note that pointerenter is also not triggered in such scenario\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular:\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.1\n- Browser(s): Safari/Chrome\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOS\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29930","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material Tree issue with mouse event (mouseenter) when hovering from a child node to its parent node in within a branch\" (#29930)"},{"Id":"2616316914","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-27T04:54:52","Actor":"dolav","Number":"29928","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support getDiameter and getStrokeWidth in MatProgressSpinnerHarness","State":"open","Body":"Adding missing attributes in MatProgressSpinnerHarness","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29928","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support getDiameter and getStrokeWidth in MatProgressSpinnerHarness\" (#29928)"},{"Id":"2610673860","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-26T19:10:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"29916","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(material/stepper): remove IE animation workaround","State":"closed","Body":"Removes a workaround that's no longer necessary now that we don't support IE.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29916","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(material/stepper): remove IE animation workaround\" (#29916)"},{"Id":"2616042367","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-26T18:06:25","Actor":"thebravedave","Number":"29927","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Material Tree duplicates tree nodes if first top level tree node has no children but other top level nodes do","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this behavior used to work in the previous version\n\n### The previous version in which this bug was not present was\n\nNot certain, just started using Angular Material, so no experience with previous versions.\n\n### Description\n\nI have been working with Angular Material tree version 18.2.10.\nI am mocking my code after the  Tree with Nested Nodes (childrenaccessor)\" on the Angular Material website:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples\nMy code matches their code exactly but if the very first top level tree node has no children but other tree nodes have children then the children get duplicated and appear as lop level nodes.\nI verified this from the example link above which has a button to open it up on StackBlitz and I am able to change the array used for the tree slightly which replicates the issue. \n\nFor instance this is the datasource used in the example linked above.  In the original example the top level tree node \"Fruit\" had children.  I deleted the children and the code re-ran itself and that replicates the error.\n```\nconst TREE_DATA: FoodNode[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'Fruit',\n    children: [],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Vegetables',\n    children: [\n      {\n        name: 'Green',\n        children: [{name: 'Broccoli'}, {name: 'Brussels sprouts'}],\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Orange',\n        children: [{name: 'Pumpkins'}, {name: 'Carrots', children: [{name: 'Baby Carrots'}]}],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\nTo duplicate this issue just go to the Angular Material Tree page linked above and find the \"Tree with nested nodes (childrenAccessor)\" example at the bottom of the page and click the StackBlitz link and then insert the above TREE_DATA datasource (or just delete the children from the \"Fruit\" node).\n\n\nIn the attachment to this issue being submitted is the image from the StackBlitz page for that childaccessor example I linked to above.  The image shows the bug I am mentioning with duplicated nodes.\n\n<!-- Uploading \"tree_bug.jpg\"... -->\n\n### Reproduction\n\nGo to the Angular Material Tree examples page:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples\nFind the second to last example: \"Tree with Nested Nodes (childrenaccessor)\".\nClick the Stackblitz button for that example.\nChange the datasource TREE_DATA so that \"Fruit\" has no children.\nLet the page reload and open up the tree to see duplicated nodes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect not to see duplicated tree nodes that are outside of the hierarchical tree node level that they should be on.\nI would expect the tree to look normal with no duplicated tree nodes.  When loaded the tree's node structure shown on the webpage should match the structure from the datasource.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDuplicated node throughout the tree.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Angular Material: 18.2.0\n- CDK/Material: 18.2.10\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome, Edge\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material Tree duplicates tree nodes if first top level tree node has no children but other top level nodes do\" (#29927)"},{"Id":"2615017503","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T20:11:50","Actor":"FlorinCiocirlan","Number":"29926","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo in function comment","State":"open","Body":"There is a typo in file _**[components](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main)/[src](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src)/[cdk](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk)/[schematics](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk/schematics)/[update-tool](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/cdk/schematics/update-tool)/index.ts**_\n\n/**\n   * Creates a program **_form_** the specified tsconfig and patches the host\n   * to read files and directories through the given file system.\n   *\n   * @throws {TsconfigParseError} If the tsconfig could not be parsed.\n   */\n\nshould be \n\n/**\n   * Creates a program **_from_** the specified tsconfig and patches the host\n   * to read files and directories through the given file system.\n   *\n   * @throws {TsconfigParseError} If the tsconfig could not be parsed.\n   */","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29926","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Typo in function comment\" (#29926)"},{"Id":"2614399233","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-25T15:16:29","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"29925","RawContent":null,"Title":"merge material.angular.io repo","State":"open","Body":"Used git-filter-repo to rewrite history, so commits appear to have always been beneath the `material.angular.io` folder.\r\n\r\nFollows https://blog.aspect.build/otherrepo-to-monorepo\r\n\r\nNote, this MUST be a merge commit so care should be taken when merging to prevent squashing the history and losing the git blame layer.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29925","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"merge material.angular.io repo\" (#29925)"},{"Id":"2612636370","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T22:03:00","Actor":"anthonyrgreen","Number":"29921","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix header rerender bug which occurs when a table has two header rows…","State":"open","Body":"… updated simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposed solution to https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29922.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/29921","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix header rerender bug which occurs when a table has two header rows…\" (#29921)"},{"Id":"2612866803","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T21:52:53","Actor":"anthonyrgreen","Number":"29922","RawContent":null,"Title":"CDK table inappropriately rerenders table header cells when there are multiple headers","State":"open","Body":"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\nDon't known / other\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nTl;dr: See a minimal repro with root-cause, explanation, and potential fix here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-table-multiple-header-rows-nj2ljf?file=app%2Ftable-basic-example.html\n\nIf I create a mat-table, and give it multiple header rows like so:\n\n```\n    <tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedHeaderColumns\"></tr>\n    <tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedSubheaderColumns\"></tr>\n```\n\nThen, when I append a column to the inner values of both `displayedHeaderColumns` and `displayedHeaderColumns`, the cdk-table change-detection code renders the table into a 'dirty' state. The result of this is that, on the first dirty-check of the table, the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating all the `<th mat-header-cell>` elements and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\nThis phenomenon only occurs on the FIRST click post-column-add, and only if you include the 2nd (sub)header in your table definition, i.e. commenting out `<tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedSubheaderColumns\"></tr>` mitigates the bug.\n\n# Possible root cause of the bug\n\nI think this is happening because Angular somehow rerenders the subheader as a result of dirty-checking the header, but does not update its internal records of the subheader's state in the process. Clicking the button causes the table to re-check its subheader's columns, at which point its differ discovers it hasn't officially added the newest column to the list (although it is already visually displaying the newest column).\n\nThis bug disappears if I modify `CdkTable._renderUpdatedColumns` in the following manner at [angular/components/src/cdk/table/table.ts:1087](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/table/table.ts#L1087):\n\nOriginal code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => \n    acc || !!def.getColumnsDiff();\n```\n\nFixed code:\n\n```\n  const columnsDiffReducer = (acc: boolean, def: BaseRowDef) => {\n    const diff = def.getColumnsDiff();\n    return acc || !!diff;\n  };\n```\n    \nI think that the lazy computation of `def.getColumnsDiff()` is causing the subheader state not to get updated.\n\n\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-table-multiple-header-rows-nj2ljf?file=app%2Ftable-basic-example.html\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\nThere is no exception. The error is that, when the user clicks their first button on a table header, all the table headers rerender, destroying and recreating each `<th mat-header-cell>` element and preempting any interaction handlers in progress. This prevents e.g. button clicks from being registered, and, in my app, stops a menu from opening from the table header.\n\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"xokrrnnaegq.angular\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"rxjs\": \"6.4.0\",\n    \"moment\": \"2.24.0\",\n    \"core-js\": \"2.6.4\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.8.29\",\n    \"hammerjs\": \"2.0.8\",\n    \"@angular/cdk\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/http\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/material\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"web-animations-js\": \"2.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"angular-in-memory-web-api\": \"0.5.4\",\n    \"@angular/material-moment-adapter\": \"7.3.1\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"7.2.4\",\n    \"@ngrx/store\": \"^18.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint\",\n    \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.10.0\",\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~7.0.2\",\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"~8.9.4\",\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~2.8.8\",\n    \"@types/jasminewd2\": \"~2.0.3\",\n    \"codelyzer\": \"~4.5.0\",\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~2.99.1\",\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~4.2.1\",\n    \"karma\": \"~3.0.0\",\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~2.2.0\",\n    \"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter\": \"~2.0.1\",\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~1.1.2\",\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^0.2.2\",\n    \"protractor\": \"~5.4.0\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"~7.0.0\",\n    \"tslint\": \"~5.11.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~3.1.1\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29922","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CDK table inappropriately rerenders table header cells when there are multiple headers\" (#29922)"},{"Id":"2610922876","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T09:00:28","Actor":"azimuthdeveloper","Number":"29919","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs-bug(treeview): Add guide on how to migrate from old treeview to new treeview","State":"open","Body":"### Documentation Feedback\n\nFollowing the sudden deprecation of the various tree controllers, it would be nice if there were some kind of documentation on how to remove tree controller and migrate to the new way of doing things.

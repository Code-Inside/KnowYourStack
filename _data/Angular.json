To enable CSP, configure your web server to return an appropriate Content-Security-Policy HTTP header. Read more about content security policy at [An Introduction to Content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/) on the HTML5Rocks website.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nWe should clearly state some of the known limitations and configurations for using Angular with a CSP.\r\n\r\nHere are some related, known issues that have been around for 1-4 years now\r\n- [Inline <style> elements violate style-src Content Security Policy](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6361)\r\n- [[innerHTML] triggers CSP alert/report](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/25214)\r\n- [Empty style tag generated when one or more components don't have styles](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31191)\r\n- [feat: add a customizable nonce attribute for injected style elements](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/26152)\r\n\r\n## Suggested Steps\r\n\r\n1. We should clearly state that allowing `'unsafe-inline'` in `style-src` is required for Angular applications.\r\n1. We should clearly state that `'self'` is required for `style-src` and `script-src` in Angular applications.\r\n1. We should recommend `upgrade-insecure-requests`.\r\n1. We should document that `connect-src` must be configured with `'self'` and any other font, script, or style sources that are retrieved by `@angular/service-worker`.\r\n\r\nIf there are some little-known work arounds for any of these issues, they should be documented in this guide.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\nChrome 85\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n[WebPageTest.org](https://webpagetest.org/) now gives web sites/apps a security grade based on a scan by [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/security#content-security-policy gets the following score\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 12 28 10 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3506071/84978392-c6181100-b0fa-11ea-9182-74de8ed6bd48.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 12 29 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3506071/84978402-cadcc500-b0fa-11ea-9fb0-6f6e39a16eba.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37631","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs(security): add useful guidance to the CSP section of the guide\" (#37631)"},{"Id":"640895877","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T04:24:18","Actor":"pbothra","Number":"37630","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prod AOT build - Error - ESIDIR read erro","State":"open","Body":"Hi \r\nWhile running prod aot build commands, getting following error\r\nnode --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --aot --prod \r\nError: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read\r\n    at Object.readSync (fs.js:494:3)\r\n    at tryReadSync (fs.js:333:20)\r\n    at Object.readFileSync (fs.js:370:19)\r\n    at Storage.provideSync (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\enhanced-resolve\\lib\\CachedInputFileSystem.js:98:13)\r\n    at CachedInputFileSystem.readFileSync (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\enhanced-resolve\\lib\\CachedInputFileSystem.js:259:32)\r\n    at WebpackFileSystem.readFileAsUtf8 (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\WebpackFileSystem.js:51:24)\r\n    at LicenseTextReader.readText (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\LicenseTextReader.js:50:14)\r\n    at LicenseTextReader.readLicense (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\LicenseTextReader.js:38:25)\r\n    at PluginChunkReadHandler.processModule (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\PluginChunkReadHandler.js:52:62)\r\n    at D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\PluginChunkReadHandler.js:29:23        \r\n    at WebpackModuleFileIterator.iterateFiles (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\WebpackModuleFileIterator.js:7:9)\r\n    at D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\PluginChunkReadHandler.js:27:32        \r\n    at WebpackChunkModuleIterator.iterateModules (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\WebpackChunkModuleIterator.js:21:21)\r\n    at PluginChunkReadHandler.processChunk (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\PluginChunkReadHandler.js:26:29)\r\n    at _loop_1 (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\WebpackCompilerHandler.js:48:37)\r\n    at WebpackCompilerHandler.iterateChunks (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\WebpackCompilerHandler.js:71:17)\r\n    at D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\license-webpack-plugin\\dist\\WebpackCompilerHandler.js:29:27        \r\n    at AsyncSeriesHook.eval [as callAsync] (eval at create (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\tapable\\lib\\HookCodeFactory.js:32:10), <anonymous>:14:1)\r\n    at AsyncSeriesHook.lazyCompileHook (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\tapable\\lib\\Hook.js:154:20)       \r\n    at hooks.additionalAssets.callAsync.err (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\webpack\\lib\\Compilation.js:1281:36)\r\n    at AsyncSeriesHook.eval [as callAsync] (eval at create (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\tapable\\lib\\HookCodeFactory.js:32:10), <anonymous>:9:1)\r\n    at AsyncSeriesHook.lazyCompileHook (D:\\typescript\\node_modules\\tapable\\lib\\Hook.js:154:20)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37630","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Prod AOT build - Error - ESIDIR read erro\" (#37630)"},{"Id":"640813083","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T00:01:15","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"37629","RawContent":null,"Title":"Flaky `test_aio` and `test_aio_local` CircleCI jobs","State":"open","Body":"The `test_aio` and `test_aio_local` CircleCI jobs started to be quite flaky recently (~50% of attempts results in false-positive failures).

Under the hood we use Mitt, but we extend Mitt with additional functionality to match most of the methods that Node‚Äôs EventEmitter provides. The following methods have been removed from Puppeteer classes that extend EventEmitter: \n\n-   `eventNames()`\n-   `getMaxListeners()`\n-   `listeners(eventName)`\n-   `prependListener`\n-   `prependOnceListener`\n-   `setMaxListeners(n)`\n-   `rawListeners(eventName)`\n\nAdditionally all the static methods on the EventEmitter class are not supported:\n\n-   `listenerCount(emitter, eventName)`\n-   `defaultMaxListeners`\n-   `errorMonitor`\n\nNode‚Äôs EventEmitter emitted a `newListener` event when a listener was added and a `removeListener` event when one was removed. These are not supported and will not be emitted.\n\n#### New features and improvements\n\n-   Send/receive debug logs are now split out into separate channels making the logs much clearer ([#&#8203;6017](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6017))\n-   You can now call `isJavaScriptEnabled()` on a Puppeteer `page` to find out if JS is enabled on the page ([#&#8203;5993](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5993)) \n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n-   Puppeteer is now much better at killing lingering browser processes, especially when you exit a test run with `Ctrl-C` ([#&#8203;6011](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6011))\n\n#### Behind the scenes\n\n-   We've started work on a new documentation system that uses TSDoc to generate documentation from our source code and have been porting documentation into code accordingly.\n\n#### Raw notes\n\n[`5493494`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/5493494) -

We're sorry for causing unexpected issues in the 3.2.0 release. If you were unable to upgrade from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0, you will be able to upgrade straight to 3.3.0 and not have any issues.\n\n##### Behind the scenes\n\n-   The Puppeteer `Response` class was renamed `HTTPResponse` to avoid a clash with the TS `Response` type. We don't expose this class on the main Puppeteer instance so this shouldn't affect any of your code.\n-   Similarly we have renamed `Worker` to `WebWorker` to avoid a clash with the TS `Worker` type. \n\n##### Raw Notes\n\n[`34c0f9b`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/34c0f9b) - chore: mark version v3.3.0\n[`309d811`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/309d811) - chore: Revert Mitt due to breaking changes ([#&#8203;5952](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5952))\n[`81e3248`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/81e3248) - chore: Defer Windows FF tests for longer ([#&#8203;5954](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5954))\n[`b874cac`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/b874cac) - chore: rename Worker to WebWorker ([#&#8203;5941](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5941))\n[`7862484`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/7862484) - chore: update request and response references in docs ([#&#8203;5942](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5942))\n[`232def0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/232def0) - chore: rename `Response` to `HTTPResponse` ([#&#8203;5940](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5940))\n[`cfd72ac`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/cfd72ac) - chore: bump version to v3.2.0-post ([#&#8203;5938](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5938))\n\n### [`v3.2.0`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/v3.2.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)\n\n##### Highlights\n\n-   We now support emulating vision deficiency types within Puppeteer using `page.emulateVisionDeficiency`. You can read more about these [on the DevTools update blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/03/devtools#vision-deficiencies).\n\n-   We now use [Mitt](https://togithub.com/developit/mitt/) as the Event Emitter that backs many of Puppeteer's classes rather than the EventEmitter module that ships with Node. This **is potentially a breaking change if you rely on some of the less popular EventEmitter methods** as Puppeteer's [EventEmitter](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/src/EventEmitter.ts) does not support the entire suite of NodeJS EventEmitter functions. We think it's unlikely anyone has relied on these; we were able to swap out the EventEmitter in Puppeteer without any unit tests needing to change.\n\n-   Puppeteer now recognises webviews as regular pages which means you can control them just like you would control a regular page.\n\n##### Behind the scenes\n\n-   The `Request` class has been renamed to `HTTPRequest` to avoid a clash with TypeScript's `Request` type. We'll be making similar changes to `Response` and `Worker`. This is not a breaking change as Puppeteer doesn't directly expose these classes so you shouldn't be referring to them by name in your code.\n\n##### Raw Notes\n\n[`1d4d25a`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/1d4d25a) -

The code that tried to debug this and show a useful error has been removed ([#&#8203;5816](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5816)). Puppeteer should install and run just fine on Node.js v14.1.0 and beyond.\n\n### Behind the scenes\n\n-   We now run unit tests on Node.js v14 ([#&#8203;5821](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5821)).\n\n### Raw notes\n\n[`c214d20`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/c214d20) - chore: mark version v3.0.4 ([#&#8203;5823](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5823))\n[`17bb660`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/17bb660) - chore: remove unused mime-types dependency ([#&#8203;5819](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5819))\n[`70340de`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/70340de) - chore: add Node.js 12 & 14 to CI ([#&#8203;5821](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5821))\n[`70d5c7f`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/70d5c7f) - fix: remove node@14 specific extract timeout ([#&#8203;5816](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5816))\n[`5115482`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/5115482) - chore: bump version to 3.0.3-post ([#&#8203;5814](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5814))\n\n### [`v3.0.3`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/v3.0.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3)\n\n### Highlights\n\n-   Puppeteer now has experimental support for custom selector engines through [`puppeteer.__experimental_registerCustomQueryHandler`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5405#issuecomment-621794572) ([#&#8203;5753](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5753)). This functionality is _so_ highly experimental it‚Äôs not even documented in the API docs ‚Äî on purpose! See [this comment](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5405#issuecomment-621794572) for instructions on how to try it out. We are hoping to gather feedback on whether this API is useful for you, and how we could improve it. Please [let us know what you think](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5405)!\n\n### Behind the scenes\n\n-   `src/` is now 100% TypeScript! This now lays a baseline to start working on improving Puppeteer docs by automatically generating them, shipping type definitions built in (for now we recommend `@types/puppeteer`).\n\n### Raw notes\n\n[`b2488eb`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/b2488eb) -

But the wrong http headers information is set (or overwritten) by the information which is set in the sockjs-node. \r\n\r\nMy get call in the service looks like this:\r\n```\r\n  getUsers(): Observable<IUser[]> {\r\n    const url = `${this.backendApiUrl}/api/users`;\r\n    const token = this.authService.getTokenFromLocalStorage();\r\n    console.log('####-user-service', token);\r\n    return this.http.get<IUser[]>(url, {\r\n      headers: new HttpHeaders().set('authtoken', token),\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe token property from local storage is the correct token but the sockjs-node call has a different token and that is applied to my HttpHeader.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nIf you have in the sockjs-node info call the same request header set, this will be transferred to the set Headers in backend call.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nnot authorized because wrong auth token is provided\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.2\r\nNode: 12.16.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.2\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.2\r\n@angular/fire                     6.0.0\r\n@angular/flex-layout              9.0.0-beta.31\r\n@angular/material                 9.2.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.2\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17938","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"socksjs-node caches old information, setting HTTP Headers fails\" (#17938)"},{"Id":"638919324","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-15T14:55:23","Actor":"clydin","Number":"17937","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(@schematics/angular): update v10 migration descriptions","State":"open","Body":"This adds links to current migration guides for several of the migrations as well as adjusts some of the descriptions to provide additional inline information.\r\n\r\nBlocked on migration guide inclusions:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37512\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37429\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37402","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/17937","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(@schematics/angular): update v10 migration descriptions\" (#17937)"},{"Id":"638610335","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-15T13:17:04","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"17936","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to version","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Update | Change |\n|---|---|\n| lockFileMaintenance | All locks refreshed |\n\n:wrench: This Pull Request updates lock files to use the latest dependency versions.\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"before 5am on monday\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

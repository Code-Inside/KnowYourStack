This was added in v17 to support SSR without relying on an infinite `setTimeout` with ZoneJS like it did pre-v17. Prior to version 17, this was also only done on the server and did not affect clients or unit tests.\r\n\r\nToday, `PendingTasks` contribute to `ApplicationRef.isStable` but do not contribute to the stability of `ComponentFixture`. This divergence in stability behavior was not intended and we plan to make these two stability indicators the same again, like they were when it was solely based on the state of the Zone.\r\n\r\nBy aligning the two behaviors again, this would include all pending tasks in the stability of fixtures. After investigation, this seems likely to be a pretty large breaking change. Tests appear to quite often use `await fixture.whenStable` when there are unfinished requests that have not been mocked or flushed.\r\n\r\nThis change prevents request in `HttpClient` from contributing to stability through the `PendingTasks` automatically but only when using `HttpClientTesting`. In this scenario, requests need to be expected and flushed manually for them to resolve. When the test backend and controllers aren't used, requests should resolve on their own so `await fixture.whenStable` shouldn't be particularly affected or problematic.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54974","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(http): Do not contribute to stability when using `provideHtt…\" (#54974)"},{"Id":"2198754065","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-20T23:32:06","Actor":"frost-cy","Number":"54973","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(compiler-cli): move config initialization into constructor","State":"closed","Body":"When TS output target is set to ES2022 or newer, the class fields don't get transpiled. \r\n\r\nThat causes a runtime error [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/translator/src/import_manager/import_manager.ts#L74) in the `this._config.generateUniqueIdentifier`. \r\n\r\nThis is because `_config` doesn't get set until the [constructor](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/translator/src/import_manager/import_manager.ts#L89) runs.\r\n \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It's a very long time for me to find what's wrong. I thought it was likely due to the fact that the cartService is being accessed before it's initialized in CartComponent. The constructor is called before the instance variables are initialized. Therefore, when trying to access this.cartService.getItems() in the initialization of items, cartService is still undefined.\r\nSo, I changed the code to:\r\nexport class CartComponent {\r\n  items: Product[];\r\n\r\n  constructor(private cartService: CartService) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.items = this.cartService.getItems();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt finally works.\r\n\r\nSo, I hope you can check the tutorial again to avoid similar problems for fresh learner like me.

(@&#8203;angular/animations)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.0-next.1`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1800-next1-2024-03-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/18.0.0-next.0...18.0.0-next.1)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n##### platform-browser-dynamic\n\n-   No longer used `RESOURCE_CACHE_PROVIDER` APIs have been removed.\n\n##### platform-server\n\n-   deprecated `platformDynamicServer` has been removed. Add an `import @&#8203;angular/compiler` and replace the usage with `platformServer`\n-   deprecated `ServerTransferStateModule` has been removed. `TransferState` can be use without providing this module.\n-   deprecated `useAbsoluteUrl` and `baseUrl` been removed from `PlatformConfig`. Provide and absolute `url` instead.\n-   Legacy handling or Node.js URL parsing has been removed from `ServerPlatformLocation`.\n\n    The main differences are;\n\n    -   `pathname` is always suffixed with a `/`.\n    -   `port` is empty when `http:` protocol and port in url is `80`\n    -   `port` is empty when `https:` protocol and port in url is `443`\n\n##### router\n\n-   This change allows `Route.redirectTo` to be a function\n    in addition to the previous string. Code which expects `redirectTo` to\n    only be a string on `Route` objects will need to be adjusted.\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [879bd80b57](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/879bd80b571368bdc6e65c5415d98ad0f546267a) | fix | capture data bindings for content projection purposes in blocks ([#&#8203;54876](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54876)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [6aff144232](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/6aff14423238f8995da8104e60c0baca26df2020) | fix | symbol feature detection for the compiler ([#&#8203;54711](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54711)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [314112de99](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/314112de99bb97475a0d8bdbddf84a3b3ce4a8fb) | fix | Prevent `markForCheck` during change detection from causing infinite loops ([#&#8203;54900](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54900)) |\n\n##### platform-browser-dynamic\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [eb20c1a8b1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/eb20c1a8b18e2e080c856e3e1bf7bcd02f3bfd28) | refactor | unused `RESOURCE_CACHE_PROVIDER` API has been removed ([#&#8203;54875](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54875)) |\n\n##### platform-server\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [07ac017731](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/07ac017731f0e08ea3736f1f212093a28648a304) | refactor | remove deprecated `platformDynamicServer` API ([#&#8203;54874](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54874)) |\n| [e8b588d8b7](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/e8b588d8b7fc014aaef99d4b0c1e4567b4aa195d) | refactor | remove deprecated `ServerTransferStateModule` API ([#&#8203;54874](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54874)) |\n| [3b1967ca64](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/3b1967ca64479df9137b3ad7a0d04dbaff6496f4) | refactor | remove deprecated `useAbsoluteUrl` and `baseUrl` from `PlatformConfig` ([#&#8203;54874](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54874)) |\n| [2357d3566c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2357d3566c4d18dc40cbda6644ed459ef7703893) | refactor | remove legacy URL handling logic ([#&#8203;54874](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/54874)) |\n\n##### router\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [2b802587f2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2b802587f27186baa493c1dd01f42d568b652f38) | feat | Allow Route.redirectTo to be a function which returns a string or UrlTree ([#&#8203;52606](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52606)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>angular/components (@&#8203;angular/cdk)</summary>\n\n### [`v18.0.0-next.1`](https://togithub.com/angular/components/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1800-next1-basalt-solitude-2024-03-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/components/compare/18.0.0-next.0...18.0.0-next.1)\n\n##### cdk\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [9343131450](https://togithub.com/angular/components/commit/93431314507b11ce8191a632547eee9f2a288775) | fix | **drag-drop:** optionally inject parent drag in preview and placeholder ([#&#8203;28750](https://togithub.com/angular/components/pull/28750)) |\n| [108cce33bf](https://togithub.com/angular/components/commit/108cce33bfb331fcdce18527480b3a89f5f81a28) | fix | **overlay:** Remove use of zone onStable to detach content ([#&#8203;28740](https://togithub.com/angular/components/pull/28740)) |\n\n<!-- CHANGELOG SPLIT MARKER -->\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Compressed (transferred) size is 1.8MB (esbuild) vs 1.5MB (webpack).

This was silently compiled incorrectly in esbuild 0.19.7 and below, and was an error from esbuild 0.19.8 to esbuild 0.20.1. Code such as the following should now work correctly:\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    const log = (x: any, y: string) => console.log(y)\n    abstract class Foo { @&#8203;log abstract foo: string }\n    new class extends Foo { foo = '' }\n\n    // Old output (with --loader=ts --tsconfig-raw={\\\"compilerOptions\\\":{\\\"experimentalDecorators\\\":true}})\n    const log = (x, y) => console.log(y);\n    class Foo {\n    }\n    new class extends Foo {\n      foo = \"\";\n    }();\n\n    // New output (with --loader=ts --tsconfig-raw={\\\"compilerOptions\\\":{\\\"experimentalDecorators\\\":true}})\n    const log = (x, y) => console.log(y);\n    class Foo {\n    }\n    __decorateClass([\n      log\n    ], Foo.prototype, \"foo\", 2);\n    new class extends Foo {\n      foo = \"\";\n    }();\n    ```\n\n-   JSON loader now preserves `__proto__` properties ([#&#8203;3700](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3700))\n\n    Copying JSON source code into a JavaScript file will change its meaning if a JSON object contains the `__proto__` key. A literal `__proto__` property in a JavaScript object literal sets the prototype of the object instead of adding a property named `__proto__`, while a literal `__proto__` property in a JSON object literal just adds a property named `__proto__`. With this release, esbuild will now work around this problem by converting JSON to JavaScript with a computed property key in this case:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    import data from 'data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}'\n    if (Object.getPrototypeOf(data)?.fail) throw 'fail'\n\n    // Old output (with --bundle)\n    (() => {\n      // <data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}>\n      var json_proto_fail_true_default = { __proto__: { fail: true } };\n\n      // entry.js\n      if (Object.getPrototypeOf(json_proto_fail_true_default)?.fail)\n        throw \"fail\";\n    })();\n\n    // New output (with --bundle)\n    (() => {\n      // <data:application/json,{\"__proto__\":{\"fail\":true}}>\n      var json_proto_fail_true_default = { [\"__proto__\"]: { fail: true } };\n\n      // example.mjs\n      if (Object.getPrototypeOf(json_proto_fail_true_default)?.fail)\n        throw \"fail\";\n    })();\n    ```\n\n-   Improve dead code removal of `switch` statements ([#&#8203;3659](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3659))\n\n    With this release, esbuild will now remove `switch` statements in branches when minifying if they are known to never be evaluated:\n\n    ```js\n    // Original code\n    if (true) foo(); else switch (bar) { case 1: baz(); break }\n\n    // Old output (with --minify)\n    if(1)foo();else switch(bar){case 1:}\n\n    // New output (with --minify)\n    foo();\n    ```\n\n-   Empty enums should behave like an object literal ([#&#8203;3657](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3657))\n\n    TypeScript allows you to create an empty enum and add properties to it at run time. While people usually use an empty object literal for this instead of a TypeScript enum, esbuild's enum transform didn't anticipate this use case and generated `undefined` instead of `{}` for an empty enum. With this release, you can now use an empty enum to generate an empty object literal.\n\n    ```ts\n    // Original code\n    enum Foo {}\n\n    // Old output (with --loader=ts)\n    var Foo = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Foo2) => {\n    })(Foo || {});\n\n    // New output (with --loader=ts)\n    var Foo = /* @&#8203;__PURE__ */ ((Foo2) => {\n      return Foo2;\n    })(Foo || {});\n    ```\n\n-   Handle Yarn Plug'n'Play edge case with `tsconfig.json` ([#&#8203;3698](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3698))\n\n    Previously a `tsconfig.json` file that `extends` another file in a package with an `exports` map failed to work when Yarn's Plug'n'Play resolution was active. This edge case should work now starting with this release.\n\n-   Work around issues with Deno 1.31+ ([#&#8203;3682](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3682))\n\n    Version 0.20.0 of esbuild changed how the esbuild child process is run in esbuild's API for Deno. Previously it used `Deno.run` but that API is being removed in favor of `Deno.Command`. As part of this change, esbuild is now calling the new `unref` function on esbuild's long-lived child process, which is supposed to allow Deno to exit when your code has finished running even though the child process is still around (previously you had to explicitly call esbuild's `stop()` function to terminate the child process for Deno to be able to exit).\n\n    However, this introduced a problem for Deno's testing API which now fails some tests that use esbuild with `error: Promise resolution is still pending but the event loop has already resolved`. It's unclear to me why this is happening. The call to `unref` was recommended by someone on the Deno core team, and calling Node's equivalent `unref` API has been working fine for esbuild in Node for a long time. It could be that I'm using it incorrectly, or that there's some reference counting and/or garbage collection bug in Deno's internals, or that Deno's `unref` just works differently than Node's `unref`. In any case, it's not good for Deno tests that use esbuild to be failing.\n\n    In this release, I am removing the call to `unref` to fix this issue. This means that you will now have to call esbuild's `stop()` function to allow Deno to exit, just like you did before esbuild version 0.20.0 when this regression was introduced.\n\n    Note: This regression wasn't caught earlier because Deno doesn't seem to fail tests that have outstanding `setTimeout` calls, which esbuild's test harness was using to enforce a maximum test runtime. Adding a `setTimeout` was allowing esbuild's Deno tests to succeed. So this regression doesn't necessarily apply to all people using tests in Deno.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>terser/terser (terser)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.29.2`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v5292)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/compare/v5.29.1...v5.29.2)\n\n-   Make sure 'computed_props' creates string keys\n-   Take into account the evaluated size when inlining\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>nodejs/undici (undici)</summary>\n\n### [`v6.9.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v6.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.8.0...v6.9.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-   feat: add new dispatch compose by [@&#8203;metcoder95](https://togithub.com/metcoder95) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2826](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2826)\n-   ci: add macos-latest to test-matrix by [@&#8203;Uzlopak](https://togithub.com/Uzlopak) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2952](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2952)\n-   types: align RequestInit.body type with lib.dom.ts by [@&#8203;jdufresne](https://togithub.com/jdufresne) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956)\n-   ci: pin versions of github actions by [@&#8203;UlisesGascon](https://togithub.com/UlisesGascon) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957)\n-   fetch: improve output for FormData, Response, Request by [@&#8203;mertcanaltin](https://togithub.com/mertcanaltin) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2955](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2955)\n-   perf: optimize collectASequenceOfBytes by [@&#8203;tsctx](https://togithub.com/tsctx) in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2958](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2958)\n\n##### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;jdufresne](https://togithub.com/jdufresne) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2956)\n-   [@&#8203;UlisesGascon](https://togithub.com/UlisesGascon) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957](https://togithub.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2957)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v6.8.0...v6.9.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"after 10:00pm every weekday,before 4:00am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

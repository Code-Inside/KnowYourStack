While record types correctly show these attributes, class types don't:\n\n```csharp\n// Works: Schema includes age range constraints of 0-120\npublic record UserRecordDto([property: Range(0, 120)] int age);\n\n// Doesn't work: Schema doesn't show age range constraints\npublic class UserClassDto([property: Range(0, 120)] int age)\n{\n    public int Age => age;\n}\n```\n\nThis inconsistency is occurring because record primary constructors auto-generate properties that carry the attributes, but class primary constructors don't.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe implementation enhances the schema generation process to:\n1. Detect when a type is using a primary constructor\n2. Find constructor parameters that match property names in the schema\n3. Apply any validation attributes from those parameters to the corresponding property schemas\n\nThis ensures consistency between validation behavior and OpenAPI documentation, particularly for class types using C# 12's primary constructor feature.\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded tests in two forms:\n- A unit test checking the schema generation directly\n- An integration test using a real HTTP server to verify attributes appear correctly in the schema\n\nFixes #61538.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `dc.services.visualstudio.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `/home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/.dotnet/dotnet msbuild /m /nologo /clp:Summary /v:minimal /nr:true /warnaserror /p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=false /home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/artifacts/toolset/restore.proj /t:__WriteToolsetLocation /clp:ErrorsOnly;NoSummary /p:__ToolsetLocationOutputFile=/home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/artifacts/toolset/10.0.0-beta.25265.101.txt ` (dns block)\n> - `pkgs.dev.azure.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `/home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/.dotnet/dotnet msbuild /m /nologo /clp:Summary /v:minimal /nr:true /warnaserror /p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=false /home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/artifacts/toolset/restore.proj /t:__WriteToolsetLocation /clp:ErrorsOnly;NoSummary /p:__ToolsetLocationOutputFile=/home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/artifacts/toolset/10.0.0-beta.25265.101.txt ` (dns block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config)\n>\n> </details>\n\n\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

MORE PROPS....\n}\n\nThe expected behavior is that when I press the submit button in the form, it fires the validation as shown in the following picture:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17419535-68ed-427d-933c-c99fd98c29d2)\n\nUnfortunately when I press the submit button (in this case, the \" add me!\" button) only the property in the main object (Product Name) is validated, the other one, is completely ignored, as shown below:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e6cc839-dd6e-4221-ab4b-924798f561c9)\n\nThe validation message is shown only if I manually input for example a negative number or remove a number and/or use the up/down number selector on the right of the control... but as soon as I press the submit button, it voids the error message and says all is good, as shown below\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b790723-24b0-4254-918c-7f7cb5367a0b)\nand when I press the button, the Product Price says to be ok... even knowing that before it was saying it was not...\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5de85ca7-5701-43d5-ae99-e529b10a0d8c)\n\nI tried to use DataAnnotationsValidator and the ObjectGraphDataAnnotationsValidator but the behavior is the same, tried also v7 server side, not 8, but the behavior is there too.\n\nI created another property, a copy of the actual price property from the Data object, and put it in the root of the main object, and there it behaves correctly, in the following example, you will see 2 prices, the first one is the problematic, and the other one is a property called price2, in the root\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/225c1161-6d12-43c7-a1bb-9d22df15e799)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is that the validation should fire correctly for numeric properties in the root object and should also work inside a nested property (in this case, Data > price ) when we press the submit button in the form as shown in the following image:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/863281f1-7e24-4a1c-a9e4-b2d14fc3d675)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nPlease download the project files, run the project and try to validate PRODUCT PRICE (price) located in the Data object of the root object.\n\n[BlazorSampleApp1.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20357966/BlazorSampleApp1.zip)\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8 and 7\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62039","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Validation not firing when pressing submit button on nested numeric property\" (#62039)"},{"Id":"3080605355","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-21T15:19:17","Actor":"oroztocil","Number":"62045","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use the unified validation API for Blazor forms","State":"open","Body":"Integrates the validation API based on https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/46349 into Blazor.

Annotate the root model class with the `[ValidatableType]` attribute.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the validation behavior will be the same as in previous versions.\r\n\r\n## Type discoverability limitations in Razor files\r\n\r\nThe requirement for declaring model types in .cs files is due to the fact that the new validation infrastructure uses a source generator to discover validatable types and generate the validation code during build. However, the Razor component compiler is also implemented as a source generator and there is currently the limitation that a source generator cannot take output of another generator as its input. This means that types declared in .razor files cannot be discovered by the validation generator.\r\n\r\nIf https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61220 is implemented, a run-time discovery of form model types could be used instead of the source generator based discovery, or as a fallback.\r\n\r\n## Support for async validations\r\n\r\nAlthough the entrypoint method in the new validation API (`IValidatableInfo.ValidateAsync`) is async, the Blazor integration only supports validation operations which are actually synchronous. That is, we do a non-awaited call to `ValidateAsync` which has to complete immediately, or an exception gets thrown. We do this to avoid the need to rewrite the existing validation infrastructure in Blazor which is synchronous. (And making it meaningfully async in the context of an UI framework is a more complex task than just marking the APIs with async.)\r\n\r\n## Error reporting\r\n\r\nCurrently, validation errors are propagated to the `EditForm` component via a fairly complex mechanism using `EditContext` and `ValidationMessageStore` This mechanism uses `FieldIdentifier` instances to map the individual errors to the relevant model properties (and consequently the relevant form input elements). \r\n\r\n`FieldIdentifier` requires a reference to the immediate parent object (_container_) which contains the property. However, the new API returns validation errors only as a `Dictionary<string, string[]>` where the key is the concatenated path to the property (e.g. `A.B[2].C`). We have to decide, how to integrate these two solutions. Some possible options are:\r\n\r\n1. Modify the `ValidationMessageStore` mechanism to not require container object references. This seems costly and there are reasons to avoid it.\r\n2. Modify the new validation API to include the container object reference in the result. E.g. `Dictionary<string, (string[], object?)>`, or something functionally equivalent.\r\n3. Modify the new validation API to raise an event when a validation error is found. At that point the validation code has the container object reference available and can expose it via the event.\r\n4. Do not modify either of the two existing implementations but do a reverse mapping from the string key to the actual container object reference in the model instance.\r\n\r\nProof-of-concept implementations of 3 and 4 are provided in this PR.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- Choose and implement a solution for the issue described in the _Error reporting_ section.\r\n- Add tests.\r\n\r\nFixes #28640\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62045","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Use the unified validation API for Blazor forms\" (#62045)"},{"Id":"3080473340","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-21T14:39:24","Actor":"Shoogn","Number":"62044","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a GetService method to ModelValidatorProviderContext class","State":"open","Body":"\n## Add new methos to and existing class\nIn ASP.NET Core when I'm going to build my own validation provider, I have to register it to work with the built-in on that is provided by ASP.NET Core framework, I have to implement two interfaces:\n1. IModelValidatorProvider\n2. IModelValidator\n\nThe **IModelValidatorProvider** has a method named **CreateValidators** and accept on parameter of type **ModelValidatorProviderContext** object.\n\nIn this method you may need to resolve some dependency object and to do that you have to inject the **IServiceCollection** interface and us it like so:\n\n```C#\n var validator = _serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider()\n     .GetService(validatorType);\n```\n\nInstead of doing that my suggestion here is to add a new method to this class (**ModelValidatorProviderContext**) named **GetService** and should accept one parameter of type **Type** object\n\n```C#\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding.Validation;\npublic class ModelValidatorProviderContext\n{\n    public ModelValidatorProviderContext(ModelMetadata modelMetadata, IList<ValidatorItem> items)\n    {\n        ModelMetadata = modelMetadata;\n        Results = items;\n    }\n    public ModelMetadata ModelMetadata { get; set; }\n    public IReadOnlyList<object> ValidatorMetadata => ModelMetadata.ValidatorMetadata;\n    public IList<ValidatorItem> Results { get; }\n\n    // this is the new method\n    object? IServiceProvider GetService(type type);\n}\n```\nHere is the new method:\n\n```C#\n object? IServiceProvider GetService(type type);\n```\nAnd now here I can user the **GetService** method without needing to inject **IServiceCollection** interface to the object constructor:\n\n```C#\n var validatorType = typeof(IValidator<>).MakeGenericType(\n     context.ModelMetadata.ModelType);\nvar object = context.GetService(validatorType)\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\nHere is my complete custom validator provider object:\n\n```C#\npublic class ModelValidatorProvider : IModelValidatorProvider\n{\n  // now no need for constructor at al here\n\n    public void CreateValidators(ModelValidatorProviderContext context)\n    {\n        var validatorType = typeof(IValidator<>).MakeGenericType(\n            context.ModelMetadata.ModelType);\n\n  // here is the usage of the new method\n        var validator = context.GetService(validatorType)\n\n        if (validator != null)\n        {\n            var simpleValidatorType = typeof(ModelValidator<>).MakeGenericType(context.ModelMetadata.ModelType);\n\n            var simpleValidator = (IModelValidator?)Activator.CreateInstance(simpleValidatorType, validator);\n\n            context.Results.Add(new ValidatorItem\n            {\n                IsReusable = true,\n                Validator = simpleValidator\n            });\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62044","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add a GetService method to ModelValidatorProviderContext class\"

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

For example, the options associated with that scheme should be configured correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.SuppressAutoDefaultScheme` app context flag.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Changes in default authentication scheme handling for ASP.NET Core\" (#490)"},{"Id":"1287742787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T18:44:22","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"488","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs detailed in dotnet/aspnetcore#42413, the file-serving middleware (`DefaultFilesMiddleware`, `DirectoryBrowserMiddleware`, and `StaticFileMiddleware`) have been updated to no longer no-op (i.e. defer to the next middleware in the pipeline) in the case that there is an active endpoint with a `null` request delegate.\r\n\r\nPR that makes the change: dotnet/aspnetcore#42458\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nPreviously, if the current request had an active endpoint, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint() != null`, the file-serving middleware would perform no action and simply delegate to the next middleware in the request pipeline.\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe file-serving middleware will now only perform no action if there is an active endpoint and its `RequestDelegate` property value is not `null`, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint()?.RequestDelegate is not null`.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThis change will enable endpoints to be active in the request for the purposes of setting and sharing metadata with middleware that are endpoint-aware so that they can perform their intended function, while allowing other middleware (like the file-serving middleware) that would usually defer their behavior when an endpoint is active to also function.\r\n\r\nFor example, an endpoint with a `null` request delegate containing authorization metadata can be set as the active endpoint for a request, causing the `AuthorizationMiddleware` to enforce authorization requirements, which if satisfied would allow the `StaticFileMiddleware` to serve the requested files.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you are relying on setting an active endpoint on the request to suppress the behavior of the file-serving middleware, ensure that the endpoint has a non-null value set for its `RequestDelegate` property.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseStaticFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDefaultFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDirectoryBrowser()`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active\" (#488)"},{"Id":"1278667050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T16:03:03","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"487","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Unit testing SignalR Hubs may need updating","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`IHubClients` and `IHubCallerClients` now hide interface members `IClientProxy Client(string connectionId);` and `IClientProxy Caller { get;

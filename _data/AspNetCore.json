The new version is set up to be used as a DI service (not a `static`) and contains code to lazy-load the associated `.js` file.\r\n\r\nI've made it an `IAsyncDisposable` because you could think of it as a good practice to remind people that `IJSObjectReference` instances are `IAsyncDisposable`. In practice, as long as `ExampleJsInterop` is consumed as a scoped or singleton instance, there would be no need ever to dispose the lazy-loaded JS module so it's kind of redundant, but I think we should do it like I have here in order to be more risk averse and not set a bad example that disposability can be ignored.\r\n\r\nOn balance I think the new version of `ExampleJsInterop.cs` is more useful than the previous one and guides people to be more successful, so it's worth the extra 20 lines of code there.\r\n\r\n### Design note 2\r\n\r\nMost of the lines of code in `ExampleJsInterop.cs` could be factored out into an abstract base class, e.g., `JSModuleBase`. This could contain methods like `InvokeAsync(...)` etc. that pass through the call to `(await ModuleTask).InvokeAsync(...)` so you wouldn't even have to think about awaiting the module load. This base class constructor would take care of calling `import`, and obviously it could deal with `IAsyncDisposable` too. Then the developer's own code could be reduced to something like:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic class ExampleJsInterop : JSModuleBase\r\n{\r\n    public ExampleJsInterop(IJSRuntime jsRuntime)\r\n        : base(jsRuntime, \"./_content/Company.RazorClassLibrary1/exampleJsInterop.js\")\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ValueTask<string> Prompt(string message)\r\n        => InvokeAsync<string>(\"showPrompt\", message);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot suggesting we do that right now, but if customers start using JS modules a lot, it might be worth thinking as a feature for 6.0.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/25613","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update RCL template to use 5.0 features\" (#25613)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"Rightio-Limited","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For example:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar jsObjectReference = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync<JSObjectReference>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n`JSObjectReference` will be made `internal`, so the new `IJSObjectReference` type must be used instead:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar jsObjectReference = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also applies for `JSInProcessObjectReference`, which was replaced by `IJSInProcessObjectReference`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe change makes this feature more consistent with other patterns within Blazor. `IJSObjectReference` is analogous to `IJSRuntime` in that it serves a similar purpose and has similar methods and extensions.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nReplace all occurrences of `JSObjectReference` and `JSInProcessObjectReference` with `IJSObjectReference` and `IJSInProcessObjectReference` in your code.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.JSInterop.JSObjectReference`\r\n`Microsoft.JSInterop.JSInProcessObjectReference`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf no APIs are affected, this should read:\r\n     \"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n  If affected APIs are identifiable, include a link for each.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run. The exception thrown will be handled by the server. For example, the exception will be converted to a 500 error response by Kestrel HTTP server or HTTP.SYS server. \r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n\r\nSee discussion at: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/25288\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/434","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ExceptionHandlerMiddleware will throw original exception if exception handler cannot be found\" (#434)"},{"Id":"684954186","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-24T20:45:36","Actor":"NTaylorMullen","Number":"433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Removed RazorTemplateEngine API","State":"open","Body":"*Please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/25215 to discuss this change*\r\n\r\n## Removed RazorTemplateEngine API\r\n\r\nThe `RazorTemplateEngine` API was removed in favor of `RazorProjectEngine`.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n3.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\nA template engine could be created and used to parse and generate code for Razor files\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nA `RazorProjectEngine`  can be created and fed the same type of information as a `RazorTemplateEngine` to parse and generate code for Razor files.

So, starting with .NET 5 preview 7, the `.razor` compiler will omit insignificant whitespace by default.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, this will not have any effect on the visual layout of the rendered component, since the whitespace nodes being removed would not normally affect it. However, the whitespace might affect the rendered output if you are using a CSS rule like `white-space: pre`. If you need to preserve the whitespace, you can use the new directive `@preservewhitespace true` at the top of your `.razor` file, or inside an `_Imports.razor` file to apply the preference to an entire subdirectory or even your whole project.\r\n\r\nFor further discussions, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23568\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following `.razor` code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n    @foreach (var item in Items)\r\n    {\r\n        <li>\r\n            @item.Text\r\n        </li>\r\n    }\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would previously have rendered two whitespace nodes outside the `@foreach`, and then two more around the `<li>`, and then two more around `@item.Text`. If the list contained 100 items, this would have been 402 whitespace nodes - i.e., more than half of all nodes rendered, even though none of them would visually affect the rendered output. Eliminating them at compile time greatly improves performance for rendering and diffing.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes were preserved\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes are removed if:\r\n\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within an element\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within a `RenderFragment` parameter (e.g., child content being passed to another component)\r\n * ... they precede or follow a C# code block such as an `@if`, `@foreach`, etc.\r\n\r\n... except if the `@preservewhitespace` directive is used with value `true`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nPerformance.

This is available starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 \r\n- A set of ciphers compatible with HTTP/2. THis is available starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\nAs such, Kestrel's behavior when HTTP/2 over TLS is configured has been changed to:\r\n- Downgrade to `Http1` and log a message at the `Information` level when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http1AndHttp2`. Note this is the default value for `ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`.\r\n- Throw a `NotSupportedException` when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http2`.\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 are considered as incompatible since they don't have the necessary ciphers by default, it is possible to update the Computer Configuration settings to use HTTP/2 compatible ciphers, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-8-1). Once configured, HTTP/2 over TLS on Kestrel must be explicitly enabled by setting the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2`, e.g. \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2\", true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that no underlying support has changed. For example, HTTP/2 over TLS has never worked on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012. The change here modifies how errors in these unsupported scenario are presented.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Error during TLS handshake     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Downgrade to Http1                    | Downgrade to Http1     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Throw NotSupportedException     | Throw NotSupportedException &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Downgrade to Http1                    | Downgrade to Http1     | Downgrade to Http1 &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured and the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2` need to be set to `true` to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is made to ensure compatibility errors for HTTP/2 over TLS on older Windows versions are surfaced as early and as clearly as possible. \r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure HTTP/2 over TLS is disabled on incompatible Windows versions.

As part of that we marked `UseSignalR`, `UseConnections` and some related methods (full list below) as obsolete. In ASP.NET Core 5.0 we will remove those methods entirely.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nSignalR Hubs and Connection Handlers could be registered in the middleware pipeline using the `UseSignalR` or `UseConnections` methods.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nSignalR Hubs and Connection Handlers should be registered within `UseEndpoints` using the `MapHub` and `MapConnectionHandler` extension methods on `IEndpointRouteBuilder`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe old methods had custom routing logic that didn't interact with other routing components in ASP.NET Core.

Switching to this model allows users to get the full benefits of endpoint routing.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nRemove code that called `UseSignalR` or `UseConnections` from your `Startup.Configure` method. Replace it with calls to `MapHub` and `MapConnectionHandler` within the body of a call to `UseEndpoints`.

Most of these packages were developed by and are currently maintained by the ASP.NET team. However, moving forward we want to enable more scenarios with these packages, outside of ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nThe packages which we believe are usable in various application models (Configuration, DI, Hosting, etc.) are being moved to the **dotnet/runtime repository**. Packages which are primarily used in ASP.NET Core applications (Web Encoders, etc.) are moving to the **dotnet/aspnetcore repository**. Finally, in order to avoid introducing third-party dependencies into dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore, some packages are remaining in the **dotnet/extensions repository** as they have dependencies on third-party packages (such as integrations with StackExchange.Redis and other components).\r\n\r\nThe full list of packages that are moving can be found at the end of this announcement. In general, tests and samples will be moving to the relevant repo based on where the main package moved. Issue tracking for the relevant packages will also move to that repository.\r\n\r\n## PR/Issue migrations\r\n\r\nThere are 400+ open issues and ~50 open PRs (at time of writing) in dotnet/extensions.\r\n\r\nSince we are actively working on migrating the packages now, we recommend waiting to open new PRs until we update this announcement indicating the migration is complete. Some packages are building in two repositories and we want to make sure your changes land in the right place. Over the migration process, we'll be closing most of the active PRs that target packages which have been moved and asking the author to migrate the PR to the relevant repository.\r\n\r\nFor issues, feel free to continue opening them and we'll respond to them as best we can during the migration. If the package your issue relates to has been moved, we'll handle transferring the issue. We'll be doing some triaging of the incoming issues and the backlog and will attempt to migrate as many issues as possible. As part of this process, we'll also close issues that are no longer relevant, duplicates of other issues, or enhancements we don't plan to support.\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n\r\nIf your question isn't answered here, use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask it!\r\n\r\n#### Are these packages moving in to the Base Class Library (\"BCL\"), or Microsoft.NETCore.App?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to change how these components ship as part of this migration. Packages that currently ship on NuGet.org will continue to do so. Libraries that are currently included in ASP.NET Core will continue to be included. We are not adding any of these components to the BCL at this time.\r\n\r\n#### If package `Microsoft.Extensions.X` is moving to the runtime repo, why not rename it to `System.X`?\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to rename assemblies and redirect type references, it is **not** possible to change package identities, namespaces or type names in a non-breaking way. Renaming these types would be extremely disruptive and provide very little benefit. All of these components are *already* covered by the [.NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) and will continue to be in the future, just like the `System.*` assemblies.\r\n\r\n#### Will these packages still support .NET Standard 2.0?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to reduce the set of frameworks these packages can be used on as part of this migration. If they currently support .NET Standard, we have no plans to change that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why are some packages staying in dotnet/extensions?\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we want to avoid third-party dependencies in the dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore repositories. The packages that depend on third-party dependencies are remaining in dotnet/extensions to help preserve this.\r\n\r\n#### Where should I file issues related to these packages?\r\n\r\nIn general, file issues in the repo that contains the package. Some feature areas are split between multiple repos. If you're not sure, feel free to file issues in any of the three repos (dotnet/runtime, dotnet/extensions or dotnet/aspnetcore) and the team can transfer the issue as needed.\r\n\r\n#### Why did you move package `X` to repo `Y`?\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask questions about specific packages.\r\n\r\n## Package List\r\n\r\nThe following list identifies all the packages we currently ship from [dotnet/extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions) and which repo they are moving

Also, transferring ownership of these to the Azure SDK team means they can be updated as new Azure SDK versions are released and new features become available.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nReplace the following references:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs)\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [AzureKeyVaultConfigurationExtensions.AddAzureKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.azurekeyvaultconfigurationextensions.addazurekeyvault?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1)\r\n* [AzureDataProtectionBuilderExtensions.ProtectKeysWithAzureKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.dataprotection.azuredataprotectionbuilderextensions.protectkeyswithazurekeyvault)\r\n* [AzureDataProtectionBuilderExtensions.PersistKeysToAzureBlobStorage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.dataprotection.azuredataprotectionbuilderextensions.persistkeystoazureblobstorage?view=aspnetcore-3.0)\r\n\r\nOr any other APIs consumed from the following packages:\r\n\r\n* [`Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault/)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault/)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/409","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of Microsoft.* Azure Integration Packages\" (#409)"},{"Id":"575582029","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-04T17:06:04","Actor":"anurse","Number":"408","RawContent":null,"Title":"New Azure Integration Packages in ASP.NET Core 5","State":"open","Body":"Please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19570 for any discussions on this announcement.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core currently includes three packages designed to integrate our components with Azure services. Specifically, the following three packages:\r\n\r\n* [`Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault/), which integrates Azure KeyVault in to the Configuration system.\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault/), which integrates Azure KeyVault into the ASP.NET Core Data Protection system.\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage/), which integrates Azure Blob Storage into the ASP.NET Core Data Protection system.\r\n\r\nThe Azure SDK team is introducing brand new packages that provide the same extensions using the latest version of the Azure SDK. These packages will be maintained by the Azure SDK team at the [Azure/azure-sdk-for-net repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net). Moving these packages over to the Azure SDK team will allow that team to update them as the SDKs themselves are updated, rather than being tied to the .NET Core schedule.\r\n\r\nIf you are using any of the packages listed above, we suggest replacing them with the new packages:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs)\r\n\r\nThese new packages are **supported** on .NET Core 2.1 and 3.1 so you *do not need to wait for 5.0 to update*!\r\n\r\nThese are new packages that bring in a new version of the Azure SDK which includes breaking changes. The general usage patterns are the same as the existing packages, but some overloads and options may be different (in order to react to the changes to the underlying Azure SDK APIs).\r\n\r\nThe existing `Microsoft.` packages listed above will continue to be *fully supported* by the ASP.NET Core team for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1 and 3.1. However, they **will not** be shipping in .NET 5. When upgrading your application to .NET 5, you will need to transition to the `Azure.` packages in order to be supported.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/408","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New Azure Integration Packages in ASP.NET Core 5\" (#408)"},{"Id":"574866594","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-03T18:45:15","Actor":"ryanbrandenburg","Number":"407","RawContent":null,"Title":"ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer class and WithCulture interface member to be removed","State":"open","Body":"Following up on https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/346.\r\n\r\nThe [ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer](https://github.com/aspnet/Localization/blob/43b974482c7b703c92085c6f68b3b23d8fe32720/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Localization/ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer.cs#L18) class and [WithCulture](https://github.com/aspnet/Localization/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Localization/ResourceManagerStringLocalizer.cs#L154-L170) interface member were often sources of confusion for users of Localization, especially if they wanted to create their own IStringLocalizer implementation.

I'm pretty sure my setup is correct. At the moment this is running as localhost, the web apps aren't actually deployed to Azure yet. I know CORS is correct, I have other code in the same web app that uploads files to other containers in the same storage account using SAS generated on the fly. The containers are set to Private access.\r\n\r\nMy config is simple (X509 is a custom utility class that returns a certificate instance).\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nservices.AddDataProtection()\r\n    .SetApplicationName(\"xxxxxxxx.com\")\r\n    .ProtectKeysWithCertificate(X509.GetCertificate(xxxxxxx))\r\n    .PersistKeysToAzureBlobStorage(new Uri(xxxxxxx));\r\n\r\nservices.AddMvc( ssl, https, etc );\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot shown is how I obtain and use the storage connection string, but since the resulting URI looks good (and the same connection string works for my upload process), I'm sure that part is ok. In fact, the only major difference between my working uploader and my DataProtection effort is that the uploader requests limited permissions on the fly, whereas the DataProtection URI is created referencing a policy (with all permissions and no start or expiration). The resulting URI looks normal to me. And since the error relates to authorization, I doubt it gets as far as the URI structure anyway, but here it is with sensitive details removed:\r\n\r\n`https://xxxxxxx.blob.core.windows.net/container_name/keys.xml?sv=2017-04-17&sr=b&si=aspnet-dpapi&sig=xxxxxxxxxxx`\r\n\r\nLocally I'm using Kestrel, if that matters. The beginning of the stack trace is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.KeyManagement.KeyRingProvider[48]\r\n      An error occurred while reading the key ring.\r\nMicrosoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.StorageException: Server failed to authenticate the request. Make sure the value of Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature.\r\n```\r\n\r\nKind of stumped about how to troubleshoot this, there aren't any other auth-relevant options on the DataProtection service, as far as I can tell. Shouldn't the use of a SAS token remove the requirement for an auth header?"},{"Id":"7272051005","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T21:43:00","Actor":"benaadams","Repository":"aspnet/Home","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2889","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Increase MicrosoftNETCore to 2.1.0-preview1-02411+\" (#2889) at aspnet/Home","RelatedBody":"Currently it looks like its `2.1.0-preview1-26213` which means you'll get bitten by this bug \"Fix GC reproting for by-ref-like structs\" https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16231 and have errors which make no sense.\r\n\r\nLooking at the merge train that's the version it was fixed at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commits/release/2.1\r\n\r\n/cc @davidfowl @pakrym @halter73 \r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"7271566534","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T20:03:16","Actor":"mikelunn","Repository":"aspnet/Home","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2888","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Proxy Doesn't Work With Host Name Alias\" (#2888) at aspnet/Home","RelatedBody":"This issue references the AspNet/Proxy repository for .Net Core.

We're firmly in the streams camp now so I think we should make this change (it also cleans and a bunch of things and introduces problems 😄 ).\r\n\r\n- The IConnection implements IDuplexPipe, it's a very simple contract, the IConnection is responsible for writing to the IDuplex pipe that is exposed. \r\n- We already changed the HttpConnection to use pipelines internal so the change there was deleting code. \r\n- This change is also required to support SignalR on top of TCP.\r\n- The server and client dispatching loop look more similar.\r\n- We were able to remove all callback handling from this layer.\r\n- The event queue is gone, the pipe is single producer and single consumer. The hub connection layer is the only one that has to implement callbacks.\r\n- With this change we don't allow running client callbacks in parallel (not sure why we even bothered before) so we were able to remove the event queue.\r\n\r\nQuirks:\r\n- Completing the pipe is messy, do we still need StopAsync and DisposeAsync? \r\n- Who is responsible for completing the PipeReader and PipeWriter exposed by the connection? At a minimum the IConnection impl needs to complete the application sides.\r\n- ~No errors if the you write to the connection before it starts or after it is disposed. This is possible but requires wrapping the PipeReader and PipeWriter returned.~ (solved)\r\n- ~The current implementation gives you a null pipe if you you don't call Start first, this can be fixed by making a wrapping PipeWriter and PipeReader.~ (solved)\r\n- IConnection.DisposeAsync doesn't own the receive loop anymore so it returns before the loop ended. This might be fixable if we hook the right events. This also makes it hard to reuse pipes.(not solved)\r\n- Today we have an ill defined contract as to which part of the client is reusable, is that part of the IConnection contract? This might make that a bit tricker."},{"Id":"7272276741","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T22:31:37","Actor":"mikaelm12","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/1473","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Expose PauseWriter and ResumeWriter Thresholds\" (#1473) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":"Exposing pipe thresholds in HttpSocketOptions\r\nIssue : https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/1207"},{"Id":"7272262000","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T22:28:18","Actor":"racamp101","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/1472","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".Net Core 2 Signalr core alpha2 Hub not working\" (#1472) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":"I have a major issue I can not solve.

The below issues affect Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 with ASP.NET 5 Release Candidate 1.\n#### tl;dr\n- Please fix nesting rules for `.less`, `.scss` and `.sass`, so those files are nested under `.html`.\n- Please fix incorrect nesting that sometimes appear after renaming/moving/copying files and folders.\n- Please provide an option to disable all file nesting, and eventually, options to configure nesting rules.\n- Please fix other critical Solution Explorer issues - this is just one of them, and there are many more.\n#### File nesting is inconsistent when nesting files under `.html`.\n\nThe `.less` and `.scss` files should be nested under `.html`. Those files compile to `.css` just like `.ts` compile to `.js` and they are just as much part of the view component. \n![less-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942660/6452782c-a838-11e5-9a44-d7ab6a2e5fc9.png)\n![scss-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942664/66bbd3a6-a838-11e5-8e3c-f1c369d5e1de.png)\nIn fact, if we only have a `.css` file in there, then it _is_ nested as expected, so clearly `.less` and `.scss` should also be nested:\n![css-is-nested-as-expected](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942670/6be4bdd4-a838-11e5-99b1-1dcc43238459.png)\n\nWhile the above is clearly a bug, and a very annoying one at that, the rules for other file types are less obvious, but should maybe also be considered... maybe `.json` should also be nested under `.html`?\nIt probably contains either settings, string resources, or data for that view component, so it seems resonable to me, although I consider this far less important than getting the style sheet nesting fixed.\n![json-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11939884/4a1bb224-a825-11e5-9ff6-631b4e8fed39.png)\n\nThose nesting rules have been inconsistent ever since they were introduced in ASP.NET 5, and **it really needs to be fixed**. Sure, everything compiles just fine, but I'm getting really pissed off looking at this mess in my Solution Explorer every day. Inconsistencies like this makes the whole concept of nesting seem like an annoyance more than a help, as it raises the obvious question \"if only some files are nested, then why nest anything at all - that's just an extra click to get to the .ts file\". Which brings me to...\n#### File nesting can be annoying\n\nWhile the fundamental idea of file nesting is not nessesarily bad, it can be _very_ annoying at times, which is why, as a _minimum_, **I want an option to disable all file nesting** - and ideally, options to configure the nesting rules.\n\nConsider this folder structure, where the folder already represents a container for the component:\n![file-nesting-is-annoying](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11940913/ff28392a-a82b-11e5-86b4-571bc70d21bb.png)\nHere the file nesting provides no benefit at all, and actually just introduces a _really_ annoying extra click to get to the `.ts` file. A possible fix for this might be to only nest files if the folder name is different from the name of the `.html` file, but this might also be wrong - for example, a folder named `tabs` representing some fancy `tabs` component might actually contain multiple elements that work together, e.g. `tabs.html/js`, `tab-pane.html/js` and `tab-button.html/js`, and in this case we _do_ want nesting for all three of those. Therefore, I strongly believe an option to simply disable all nesting is the best option here - and it is very much needed, because despite this example, we do have projects in which the nesting provides absolutely no value and represents a major annoyance.\n\nOne could also argue that the `.html` file should actually be nested under the `.js` file.\nConsider an Angular 2 application, where the `.ts` file represents the actual Component, annotated with metadata specifying either the path to the `.html` file representing its view, or if the view is small, a string representing the markup of the view. Same for styles, where the metadata in the `.ts` file specifies either the path to the `.css` file, or a string representing the style rules. Here, both the view and the style sheet is clearly dependencies of the `.ts` file, so it would make sense to nest them below that...\n##### An alternative idea\n\nAlternatively, you could consider a completely different approach to nesting, where the part of the file name the files have in common, is used to show a \"virtual folder\" containing all the files - then file nesting could be used only for things like transpiler generated files. The image below is a concept I mocked up to illustrate this idea:\n![virtual-folder-concept](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942319/042b84ea-a836-11e5-80f1-b5941cfbdfa7.png)\nHere, all the files have the \"foo\" part of their name in common, and is therefore nested under a \"foo\" node in Solution Explorer. However, in the file system, the actual files are all located in the components folder, so in the code the path would be `app/components/foo.js` - nice an clean, works for any file type, and makes no assumptions about whether `.html` or `.js` is more important.\n\nGoing further with this idea, the IDE could also be smart, so when selecting this \"virtual folder\", it could maybe somehow open all the `foo.*` files in a split view (ignoring transpilation output of course), thus providing a quick way to see all the component code at once. Just a thought...\n### File nesting is broken\n\nNot only is file nesting inconsistent, and sometimes annoying, but it is also broken.\nHere are two cases of incorrect behavior I managed to reproduce - unfortunately, this does not seem to fail consistently, so it can be hard to reproduce - but it does happen often enough to be annoying.\n![file-nested-on-drag-copy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11943207/4749c9e8-a83c-11e5-9f15-304cb16e8419.png)\n![nesting-broken-when-folder-is-renamed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11943211/4c807074-a83c-11e5-8e71-4bed0bd4353c.png)\n\nPlease take those Solution Explorer issues seriously - I've provided feedback about multiple critical issues several several months ago, and thus far _nothing_ has improved. Solution Explorer still hangs or crashes the whole IDE when a large number of files is modified/moved/copied/renamed, it still has annoying, inconsistent and buggy file nesting, and it still constantly gets out of sync with the file system, crashing first the project system and eventually the whole IDE. I'm more that a little concerned about seeing a release candidate label on something this buggy and unpolished - if this is indeed what you intend to release, then we intend to find another IDE for our frontend development.\n"},{"Id":"7187586381","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-02T06:15:37","Actor":"simonpbond","Repository":"aspnet/Tooling","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/292","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Publish ASP.NET 5 Web Application to remote IIS \" (#292) at aspnet/Tooling","RelatedBody":"In Visual Studio 2015, I can successfully preview / publish to a remote IIS server with a 4.6 Web application.

The ASP.NET team's development resources are finite, and we think we can deliver more valuable features to ASP.NET developers by focusing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n* The `Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates` package, containing **Angular**, **React**, and **React+Redux** templates, is **not affected**. This ships in the .NET Core SDK and is officially supported. We continue to invest development effort in this package. We can put *more* time and effort into these SPA templates now the effort isn't so spread out.\r\n* If you have an existing Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project based on our SPA templates, you're not directly affected because these templates are only used to create new projects. You can continue building and shipping your app forever. Obviously we still support and enhance the underlying ASP.NET Core APIs (such as those in JavaScriptServices) that you are using.\r\n* The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates` package, containing Aurelia, Knockout, and Vue templates, continues to be available, but we'll no longer update it or work on issues related to it.\r\n* We encourage enthusiastic community members to [ship your own `dotnet new` templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates). The `dotnet new` system is extensible for this exact reason. If you want to own the go-to Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project template, now's your chance! You could [fork the ones from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates`](https://github.com/aspnet/templating/tree/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates), or start from scratch depending on what you prefer.\r\n* In the long term, if another JavaScript SPA framework becomes dominant, we will of course consider adding a template for it to the SDK templates package.\r\n\r\nI know this will be irritating to some people, especially those who have worked on PRs for the Aurelia/Knockout/Vue templates. I'm sorry about that! I hope you can understand that our goal is to offer the overall maximum benefit for ASP.NET developers based on the resources available."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"966009382377897985","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T17:59:19+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now! \n\nJoin the #ASPNET Community Standup at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":7,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"965988674474188800","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T16:37:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Catch the #ASPNET Community Standup today at 10 AM Pacific / 18:00 GMT with Javier C Nelson showing a preview of Ra… https://t.co/Fg8NoQJtJp","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"965964952442933249","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T15:02:46+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Jeff is working with cognitive services and Bots today on stream... check it out! https://t.co/HVyIw0Wcgd","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":6,"FavoriteCount":7,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"963791622822612994","CreatedAt":"2018-02-14T15:06:43+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join our @csharpfritz this FRIDAY at 10am / 15:00 UTC for a free online workshop to get started with ASPNet Core.… https://t.co/qtufFsbfmc","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":24,"FavoriteCount":16,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"963559608869568512","CreatedAt":"2018-02-13T23:44:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"The #ASPNET Community Standup is starting now!

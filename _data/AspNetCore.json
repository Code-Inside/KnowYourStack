Broadly speaking, it monitors all project files for changes, and when one occurs, shuts down the previous instance of \"dotnet run\" before executing \"dotnet run\" again. \"dotnet run\" itself will call \"dotnet build\", which implicitly calls \"dotnet restore\", then performs the actual build operation, before finally launching the built application using the settings from the project's \"launchSettings.json\" file.\r\n\r\nFor cmd line centric dev experiences, this approach leads to quite a lot of overhead and thus time that the developer is waiting after making a code change to seeing that change available in the running application.\r\n\r\nTo be more efficient, dotnet-watch should attempt to only perform tasks that are necessary based on the type of change that's detected. The CLI already supports suppressing many implied operations to avoid their cost if the invoker knows they're not required and dotnet-watch should try to take advantage of this.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nThe following changes are proposed, in priority order, to investigate and if feasible implement, to reduce the amount of time users have to wait when using dotnet-watch to help automate their dev workflow.\r\n\r\n1. [ ] If changes detected would not impact NuGet packages installed, e.g. no project files, build files (Directory.Build.props and Directory.Build.targets), or nuget.config files edited, then disable the implicit NuGet restore on resultant build with the `--no-restore` flag\r\n1. [ ] Explicitly build only the projects that would be impacted by detected changes, based on the project reference graph, building each in turn with the `--no-dependencies` flag, in order to avoid the overhead of building projects with no changes\r\n1. [ ] In Razor projects, if detected changes only include `.cshtml` files, only invoke the Razor compilation target of the containing project, as these are built into a separate assembly\r\n1. [ ] Keep the `VBCSCompiler` server process alive between detected changes to avoid it shutting down and having to incur its startup time cost on subsequent detected changes\r\n\r\n@pranavkm ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23073","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make dotnet-watch more efficient by only executing required tasks for known change types\" (#23073)"},{"Id":"640825659","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T00:42:00","Actor":"dougbu","Number":"23072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enable `/warnAsError` in Windows builds","State":"open","Body":"- Allow some warnings related to closed issues","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23072","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Enable `/warnAsError` in Windows builds\" (#23072)"},{"Id":"640823002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T00:32:56","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"23071","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add support for <BlazorLazyLoad /> item group","State":"open","Body":"Follow-up to https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/22879.\r\n\r\nAdds support for explicitly-listed dynamic assemblies.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23071","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add support for <BlazorLazyLoad /> item group\" (#23071)"},{"Id":"640820837","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T00:25:32","Actor":"JunTaoLuo","Number":"23070","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add sharedfx and targeting pack tests (#23045)","State":"open","Body":"Addresses https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19151 and https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14832.

This is available starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 \r\n- A set of ciphers compatible with HTTP/2. THis is available starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\nAs such, Kestrel's behavior when HTTP/2 over TLS is configured has been changed to:\r\n- Downgrade to `Http1` and log a message at the `Information` level when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http1AndHttp2`. Note this is the default value for `ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`.\r\n- Throw a `NotSupportedException` when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http2`.\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 are considered as incompatible since they don't have the necessary ciphers by default, it is possible to update the Computer Configuration settings to use HTTP/2 compatible ciphers, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-8-1). Once configured, HTTP/2 over TLS on Kestrel must be explicitly enabled by setting the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2`, e.g. \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2\", true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that no underlying support has changed. For example, HTTP/2 over TLS has never worked on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012. The change here modifies how errors in these unsupported scenario are presented.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Error during TLS handshake     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Error during TLS handshake                    | Error during TLS handshake     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Throw NotSupportedException     | Throw NotSupportedException &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Downgrade to Http1                    | Downgrade to Http1     | Downgrade to Http1 &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured and the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2` need to be set to `true` to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is made to ensure compatibility errors for HTTP/2 over TLS on older Windows versions are surfaced as early and as clearly as possible. \r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure HTTP/2 over TLS is disabled on incompatible Windows versions. If HTTP/2 over TLS needs to be enabled for Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2, ensure compatible cipher suites are configured and the app context switch is set to true, as discussed above.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n     \"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23068","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Discussion] Kestrel disables HTTP/2 over TLS by default on incompatible Windows versions\" (#23068)"},{"Id":"640752690","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-17T23:22:37","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"23064","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ccafa991-4408-48df-d45d-08d76e1d3434)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/efcore\r\n- **Subscription**: ccafa991-4408-48df-d45d-08d76e1d3434\r\n- **Build**: 20200617.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: 6/17/2020 9:18 PM\r\n- **Commit**: f797254d24e0ecaab4be132990c5c16a486ad09d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.3 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.4\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.3 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.4\r\n  - **dotnet-ef**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.3 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.4\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.3 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.4\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.3 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.4\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.3 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.4\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.3 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20317.4\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:ccafa991-4408-48df-d45d-08d76e1d3434)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23064","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore\" (#23064)"},{"Id":"640792687","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-17T22:59:27","Actor":"halter73","Number":"23067","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support wireshark-style connection logging in Kestrel","State":"open","Body":"I basically want @AndyPook's PR (https://github.com/davidfowl/BedrockFramework/pull/75) to add \"wireshark style logging\" to Kestrel's built in connection logging middleware.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This is available starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 \r\n- A set of ciphers compatible with HTTP/2. THis is available starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\nAs such, Kestrel's behavior when HTTP/2 over TLS is configured has been changed to:\r\n- Downgrade to `Http1` and log a message at the `Information` level when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http1AndHttp2`. Note this is the default value for `ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`.\r\n- Throw a `NotSupportedException` when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http2`.\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 are considered as incompatible since they don't have the necessary ciphers by default, it is possible to update the Computer Configuration settings to use HTTP/2 compatible ciphers, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-8-1). Once configured, HTTP/2 over TLS on Kestrel must be explicitly enabled by setting the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2`, e.g. \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2\", true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that no underlying support has changed. For example, HTTP/2 over TLS has never worked on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012. The change here modifies how errors in these unsupported scenario are presented.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Error during TLS handshake     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Error during TLS handshake                    | Error during TLS handshake     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Throw NotSupportedException     | Throw NotSupportedException &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Downgrade to Http1                    | Downgrade to Http1     | Downgrade to Http1 &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured and the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2` need to be set to `true` to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is made to ensure compatibility errors for HTTP/2 over TLS on older Windows versions are surfaced as early and as clearly as possible. \r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure HTTP/2 over TLS is disabled on incompatible Windows versions.

As part of that we marked `UseSignalR`, `UseConnections` and some related methods (full list below) as obsolete. In ASP.NET Core 5.0 we will remove those methods entirely.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nSignalR Hubs and Connection Handlers could be registered in the middleware pipeline using the `UseSignalR` or `UseConnections` methods.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nSignalR Hubs and Connection Handlers should be registered within `UseEndpoints` using the `MapHub` and `MapConnectionHandler` extension methods on `IEndpointRouteBuilder`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe old methods had custom routing logic that didn't interact with other routing components in ASP.NET Core.

Switching to this model allows users to get the full benefits of endpoint routing.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nRemove code that called `UseSignalR` or `UseConnections` from your `Startup.Configure` method. Replace it with calls to `MapHub` and `MapConnectionHandler` within the body of a call to `UseEndpoints`.

Most of these packages were developed by and are currently maintained by the ASP.NET team. However, moving forward we want to enable more scenarios with these packages, outside of ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nThe packages which we believe are usable in various application models (Configuration, DI, Hosting, etc.) are being moved to the **dotnet/runtime repository**. Packages which are primarily used in ASP.NET Core applications (Web Encoders, etc.) are moving to the **dotnet/aspnetcore repository**. Finally, in order to avoid introducing third-party dependencies into dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore, some packages are remaining in the **dotnet/extensions repository** as they have dependencies on third-party packages (such as integrations with StackExchange.Redis and other components).\r\n\r\nThe full list of packages that are moving can be found at the end of this announcement. In general, tests and samples will be moving to the relevant repo based on where the main package moved. Issue tracking for the relevant packages will also move to that repository.\r\n\r\n## PR/Issue migrations\r\n\r\nThere are 400+ open issues and ~50 open PRs (at time of writing) in dotnet/extensions.\r\n\r\nSince we are actively working on migrating the packages now, we recommend waiting to open new PRs until we update this announcement indicating the migration is complete. Some packages are building in two repositories and we want to make sure your changes land in the right place. Over the migration process, we'll be closing most of the active PRs that target packages which have been moved and asking the author to migrate the PR to the relevant repository.\r\n\r\nFor issues, feel free to continue opening them and we'll respond to them as best we can during the migration. If the package your issue relates to has been moved, we'll handle transferring the issue. We'll be doing some triaging of the incoming issues and the backlog and will attempt to migrate as many issues as possible. As part of this process, we'll also close issues that are no longer relevant, duplicates of other issues, or enhancements we don't plan to support.\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n\r\nIf your question isn't answered here, use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask it!\r\n\r\n#### Are these packages moving in to the Base Class Library (\"BCL\"), or Microsoft.NETCore.App?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to change how these components ship as part of this migration. Packages that currently ship on NuGet.org will continue to do so. Libraries that are currently included in ASP.NET Core will continue to be included. We are not adding any of these components to the BCL at this time.\r\n\r\n#### If package `Microsoft.Extensions.X` is moving to the runtime repo, why not rename it to `System.X`?\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to rename assemblies and redirect type references, it is **not** possible to change package identities, namespaces or type names in a non-breaking way. Renaming these types would be extremely disruptive and provide very little benefit. All of these components are *already* covered by the [.NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) and will continue to be in the future, just like the `System.*` assemblies.\r\n\r\n#### Will these packages still support .NET Standard 2.0?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to reduce the set of frameworks these packages can be used on as part of this migration. If they currently support .NET Standard, we have no plans to change that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why are some packages staying in dotnet/extensions?\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we want to avoid third-party dependencies in the dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore repositories. The packages that depend on third-party dependencies are remaining in dotnet/extensions to help preserve this.\r\n\r\n#### Where should I file issues related to these packages?\r\n\r\nIn general, file issues in the repo that contains the package. Some feature areas are split between multiple repos. If you're not sure, feel free to file issues in any of the three repos (dotnet/runtime, dotnet/extensions or dotnet/aspnetcore) and the team can transfer the issue as needed.\r\n\r\n#### Why did you move package `X` to repo `Y`?\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask questions about specific packages.\r\n\r\n## Package List\r\n\r\nThe following list identifies all the packages we currently ship from [dotnet/extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions) and which repo they are moving

Also, transferring ownership of these to the Azure SDK team means they can be updated as new Azure SDK versions are released and new features become available.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nReplace the following references:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.Configuration.Secrets`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.Configuration.Secrets)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage` **becomes** [`Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs)\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [AzureKeyVaultConfigurationExtensions.AddAzureKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.azurekeyvaultconfigurationextensions.addazurekeyvault?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1)\r\n* [AzureDataProtectionBuilderExtensions.ProtectKeysWithAzureKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.dataprotection.azuredataprotectionbuilderextensions.protectkeyswithazurekeyvault)\r\n* [AzureDataProtectionBuilderExtensions.PersistKeysToAzureBlobStorage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.dataprotection.azuredataprotectionbuilderextensions.persistkeystoazureblobstorage?view=aspnetcore-3.0)\r\n\r\nOr any other APIs consumed from the following packages:\r\n\r\n* [`Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault/)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault/)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/409","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of Microsoft.* Azure Integration Packages\" (#409)"},{"Id":"575582029","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-04T17:06:04","Actor":"anurse","Number":"408","RawContent":null,"Title":"New Azure Integration Packages in ASP.NET Core 5","State":"open","Body":"Please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19570 for any discussions on this announcement.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core currently includes three packages designed to integrate our components with Azure services. Specifically, the following three packages:\r\n\r\n* [`Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault/), which integrates Azure KeyVault in to the Configuration system.\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault/), which integrates Azure KeyVault into the ASP.NET Core Data Protection system.\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage/), which integrates Azure Blob Storage into the ASP.NET Core Data Protection system.\r\n\r\nThe Azure SDK team is introducing brand new packages that provide the same extensions using the latest version of the Azure SDK. These packages will be maintained by the Azure SDK team at the [Azure/azure-sdk-for-net repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net). Moving these packages over to the Azure SDK team will allow that team to update them as the SDKs themselves are updated, rather than being tied to the .NET Core schedule.\r\n\r\nIf you are using any of the packages listed above, we suggest replacing them with the preview version of the new packages:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.Configuration.Secrets`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.Configuration.Secrets)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage` **becomes** [`Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs)\r\n\r\nThese new packages are **supported** on .NET Core 2.1 and 3.1 so you *do not need to wait for 5.0 to update*! They are currently in preview, but a fully-supported General Availability (GA) release will be coming soon.\r\n\r\nThese are new packages that bring in a new version of the Azure SDK which includes breaking changes. The general usage patterns are the same as the existing packages, but some overloads and options may be different (in order to react to the changes to the underlying Azure SDK APIs).\r\n\r\nThe existing `Microsoft.` packages listed above will continue to be *fully supported* by the ASP.NET Core team for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1 and 3.1. However, they **will not** be shipping in .NET 5. When upgrading your application to .NET 5, you will need to transition to the `Azure.` packages in order to be supported.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/408","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New Azure Integration Packages in ASP.NET Core 5\" (#408)"},{"Id":"574866594","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-03T18:45:15","Actor":"ryanbrandenburg","Number":"407","RawContent":null,"Title":"ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer class and WithCulture interface member to be removed","State":"open","Body":"Following up on https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/346.\r\n\r\nThe [ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer](https://github.com/aspnet/Localization/blob/43b974482c7b703c92085c6f68b3b23d8fe32720/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Localization/ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer.cs#L18) class and [WithCulture](https://github.com/aspnet/Localization/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Localization/ResourceManagerStringLocalizer.cs#L154-L170) interface member were often sources of confusion for users of Localization, especially if they wanted to create their own IStringLocalizer implementation.

Since ASP.NET Core SignalR users may be using this package, we want to bring this issue to the attention of all ASP.NET Core users.*\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability that affects ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability exists when using the [`MessagePack`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MessagePack/) NuGet package. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how MessagePack handles deserialization.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18716\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-runtime) or your application has a dependency on any of the packages listed in [affected packages](#affected-packages), you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-runtime\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core 2.1, 3.0 or 3.1 application using SignalR with the MessagePack Hub Protocol.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core-based application that uses any of the vulnerable packages shown below, or any ASP.NET Core application running on .NET Core 2.1.x, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMessagePack | 1.0.0 - 1.8.x | 1.9.3 *With code change described below*\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0 - 3.1.1 | *Update transitive reference to `MessagePack`*\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** MessagePack 2.x is *not compatible* with ASP.NET Core SignalR.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nFirst examine the packages you have installed. If you have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` in your package graph, you must update it. If you have a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` in your project, you likely have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` and should fix it by [directly referencing a secure version](#fixing-transitive-dependencies).\r\n\r\n**In addition to updating** you must set the `MessagePackSecurity.Active` static property to enable the `UntrustedData` mode for the MessagePack serializer, to ensure you are protected. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for details. Add the following code to the top of your app's entry point:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n  // Add the following lines\r\n  // Enable additional security in MessagePack to handle untrusted data.\r\n  MessagePackSecurity.Active = MessagePackSecurity.UntrustedData;\r\n\r\n  // Continue with program initialization...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your application provides any custom `IMessagePackFormatter<T>` implementations, you should also update them to include the relevant security measures by ensuring reads of variable-length values (such as strings) are done within a `using (MessagePackSecurity.DepthStep())` block. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for more details.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.8.80\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `MessagePack` version 1.8.80\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `MessagePack` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application.

In ASP.NET Core 5.0, we will move from the 1.x version to the latest 2.x version. This is a breaking change for:\r\n\r\n* Anyone who is setting/configuring values on [`MessagePackHubProtocolOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.messagepackhubprotocoloptions)\r\n* Anyone who was using the MessagePack APIs directly **and** using the ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol in the same application, as the newer version will be loaded instead of the previous version.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously, ASP.NET Core SignalR used the MessagePack 1.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNow, ASP.NET Core SignalR will use the MessagePack 2.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior will impact some aspects of message serialization and deserialization. See the [guidance for migrating from 1.x to 2.x](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md) published by the MessagePack package authors. Specifically, there are [behavioral changes to how DateTime values are serialized](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md#behavioral-changes).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe believe updating to MessagePack v2.x will add useful new functionality and allow us to stay current with the latest improvements in that package.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you are using MessagePack directly in your application **and** using the SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol, update your usage to adapt to any breaking changes in the 2.x release of MessagePack. The MessagePack package authors have published [guidance for migrating from 1.x to 2.x](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md).\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.MessagePackHubProtocolOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.messagepackhubprotocoloptions)\r\n\r\nTo discuss this change, use the following issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18692\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/404","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol moving to MessagePack v2.x package\" (#404)"},{"Id":"549728860","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-14T18:01:38","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"403","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-0603 : ASP.NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-0603 : ASP.NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core software when the software fails to handle objects in memory.

As targeting .NET Framework adds dependencies for various packages you must update the dependencies your application uses, recompile and redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

As targeting .NET Framework adds dependencies for various packages, you must update the dependencies your application uses, recompile, and redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means one of the following:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages.\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The `FrameworkReference` includes all the libraries that make up ASP.NET Core. See https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/325 for the motivation and reason behind this change. For all libraries that are referenced in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` framework, we ignore references in your project of a lower version. For example, if a 2.2 version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel` (one of the libraries in the framework) is also separately referenced by the application, we ignore the 2.2 version when building. These update rules are defined by the `PlatformManifest.txt` file is part of the SDK. Any library in that list has this behavior, earlier references to those libraries are ignored. \r\n\r\nHowever, in 3.0.1 and 3.1.0, we introduced a regression which removed a few select references from the `PlatformManifest.txt` file by mistake.\r\n\r\nLibraries that were _removed_ from the `PlatformManifest.txt` between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1:\r\n\r\n* aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll (previously part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS package)\r\n* System.Drawing.Common.dll\r\n* Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.dll\r\n* System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.dll\r\n\r\nLibraries that were _added_ to the PlatformManifest.txt between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.Win32.Registry.dll\r\n* System.Security.AccessControl.dll\r\n* System.Security.Cryptography.Cng.dll\r\n* System.Security.Principal.Windows.dll\r\n\r\nThe libraries that were added to the `PlatformManifest.txt` shouldn't adversely affect applications. However, the dependencies _removed_ do affect applications. In particular, the `aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll` native library is critical to IIS in-process hosting. Issues with this have been reported in a few places (for example https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17662). We've now identified this is a broader regression.\r\n\r\nIf an application references (directly or transitively) a previous version of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS`, `System.Drawing.Common`, `Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents`, or `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs` package, it might deploy the older dependency rather than the 3.0/3.1 dependency. This can cause assembly load failures.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nUsers may work around this issue by doing one of the following:\r\n\r\n### Remove all direct and indirect references to the affected packages.\r\n\r\nThe following packages include the `aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll` native library:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS\r\n\r\nOther affected libraries are contained in packages with the same name. See the above lists.\r\n\r\nThe resolution is to remove these package references from your application. Be aware that they may be transitive dependencies (dependencies of other packages you depend upon).\r\n\r\n### Avoid publishing incorrect package content\r\n\r\nIf you cannot remove earlier versions of the pacakges, you can explicitly suppress those packages from publishing using `ExcludeAssets`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n     <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS\" Version=\"2.2.6\" ExcludeAssets=\"All\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe recommend clearing out bin/obj folders before building with the above fix.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/398","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SDK regression in 3.0.101 and 3.1.100 for ASP.NET Core workloads\" (#398)"},{"Id":"528976515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T21:16:55","Actor":"rynowak","Number":"396","RawContent":null,"Title":"HttpClient instances created by IHttpClientFactory will now log HTTP status codes as integers instead of with status code names","State":"open","Body":"## HttpClient logging\r\n\r\nHttpClient instances created by IHttpClientFactory will now log HTTP status codes as integers instead of with status code names.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nLogging would use the textual descriptions of HTTP status codes:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nReceived HTTP response after 56.0044ms - OK\r\nEnd processing HTTP request after 70.0862ms - OK\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nLogging will use the integer values of HTTP status codes:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nReceived HTTP response after 56.0044ms - 200\r\nEnd processing HTTP request after 70.0862ms - 200\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe original behavior of this logging is inconsistent with other parts of ASP.NET Core that have always used integer values. This inconsistency makes logs hard to query via structured logging systems such as ElasticSearch. See aspnet/Extensions#1549\r\n\r\nUsing integer values is ultimately more flexible than text because it allows queries on ranges of values. \r\n\r\nWe considered adding an additional log value to capture the integer status code, but that would introduce another inconsistency with the rest of ASP.NET Core. HttpClient logging and HTTP server/hosting logging use the same key name (`StatusCode`) already.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe best option is update logging queries to use the integer values of status codes. While this may cause some difficulty writing queries across multiple ASP.NET Core versions right now, we believe that using integers for this purpose is much more flexible for querying logs. \r\n\r\nIf for some reason you need to force compatibility with the old behavior, and use textual status codes, you can do this by replacing `IHttpClientFactory`'s logging with your own.\r\n\r\n1.

Https redirection required configuration to enable since apps in development do not use the default port 443. Hsts is only active if the request is already HTTPS, and skips localhost by default.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nIn 3.0 the IIS HTTPS scenario was [enhanced](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/4685) so that the application could discover the server HTTPS ports and make UseHttpsRedirection work by default. InProcess did this via the IServerAddresses feature, which only affects 3.0 applications because the InProcess library is versioned with the framework. OutOfProcess changed to automatically add the ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT environment variable which affected both 2.2 and 3.0 applications because the OutOfProcess component is shared globally. 2.1 apps are not affected because they use a prior version of AspNetCoreModule by default.\r\n\r\nThe 3.0 version of AspNetCoreModule was recently deployed to Azure Web Sites and some users noticed the that this did affect their 2.2 applications as described above.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nImproved 3.0 functionality.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you want all clients to use HTTPS then no action is required. If you want to allow some clients to use HTTP then take one of the following steps:\r\n\r\nA) Remove UseHttpsRedirection and UseHsts from your application's Startup.cs file and redeploy the application.\r\n\r\nOr B) Add the environment variable ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT with an empty value to your web.config file.

These changes impact remote authentication scenarios like OpenIdConnect and WsFederation which must now opt out by sending SameSite=None. However, SameSite=None breaks on iOS 12 and some older versions of other browsers. The application will need to sniff these versions and omit SameSite.\r\n\r\nFor discussion on this issue see https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/14996.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n3.1.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nSameSite is a [2016 draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07#section-4.1) extension to HTTP cookies intended to mitigate cross site request forgery (CSRF). This was originally designed as a feature the servers would opt into by adding the new parameters. ASP.NET Core 2.0 added initial support for SameSite.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nGoogle is now pushing [a new draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00) that is not backwards compatible. It changes the default mode to Lax and adds a new entry None to opt out. Lax is OK for most application cookies but breaks cross site scenarios like OpenIdConnect and WsFederation login. Most OAuth logins are not affected due to differences in how the request flows. The new None parameter causes compatibility problems with clients that implemented the prior draft standard (e.g. iOS 12). Chrome plans to go live with their changes in Chrome 80 in February 2020.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 3.1 has been [updated](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/13776/files) to implement the new SameSite behavior. This includes redefining the behavior of SameSiteMode.None to emit “SameSite=None” and adding a new value SameSiteMode.Unspecified to omit the SameSite attribute. All cookies APIs now default to Unspecified, though some components that use cookies set values more specific to their scenarios such as the OpenIdConnect correlation and nonce cookies.\r\n\r\nFor other recent changes in this area see the [3.0 announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/348) where most defaults were changed from Lax to None (but still using the prior standard).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nBrowser and spec changes as outlined above.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplications that interact with remote sites such as through 3rd party login will need to test those scenarios on multiple browsers, as well as apply the CookiePolicy browser sniffing mitigation discussed below. See below for testing and browser sniffing instructions.\r\nHow to test if you’re affected \r\nTest your web application using a client version that can opt-in to the new behavior. Chrome, Firefox, and Chromium Edge all have new opt-in feature flags that can be used for testing. \r\nYou’ll also want to do compatibility testing with older client versions after you’ve applied the patches, especially Safari. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\n \r\nChrome:\r\nChrome 78+ will give you misleading test results as it has a temporary mitigation in place, allowing cookies less than two minutes old. Chrome 76 or 77 with the appropriate test flags turned on will give you more accurate results. To test the new behavior toggle chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies to enabled. Older versions of Chrome (75 and below) are reported to fail with the new None setting. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\nWhilst Google does not make older chrome versions available you can download older versions of Chromium which will suffice for testing. Follow the instructions at https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium, don’t go downloading random assed installers from the internet that say they’re for older versions.  \r\n[Chromium 76 Win64 ](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/664998/)\r\n[Chromium 74 Win64](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/638880/)\r\n\r\nSafari:\r\nSafari 12 strictly implemented the prior draft and will fail if it sees the new None value in cookies. This must be avoided via the browser sniffing code shown below. Ensure you test Safari 12 and Safari 13 as well as WebKit based OS style logins using MSAL, ADAL or whatever library you are using. Note that the problem is dependent on the underlying OS version, OSX Mojave (10.14) and iOS 12 are known to have compatibility problems with the new behavior. Upgrading the OS to OSX Catalina (10.15) or iOS 13 fixes the problem. Safari does not currently have an opt-in flag for testing the new spec behavior. \r\n\r\nFirefox:\r\nFirefox support for the new standard can be tested on version 68+ by opting in on the “about:config” page with the feature flag “network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault”. There have not been reports of compatibility issues with older versions of Firefox. \r\n\r\nEdge:\r\nWhile Edge supports the old SameSite standard, as of version 44 it did not have any compatibility problems with the new standard. \r\n\r\nEdge (Chromium):\r\nThe feature flag is edge://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies. No compatibility issues were observed when testing with Edge Chromium 78. \r\n\r\nElectron:\r\nVersions of electron will include older versions of Chromium, for example the version of Electron used by Teams is Chromium 66 which exhibits the older behavior. You must perform your own compatibility testing with the version of Electron your product uses. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\n\r\nSupporting older browsers:\r\nThe 2016 SameSite standard mandated that unknown values must be treated as SameSite=Strict values, so any older browsers which support the original standard may break when they see a SameSite property with a value of None. Web applications must implement browser sniffing if they intend to support these old browsers. AspNetCore as a rule does not implement browser sniffing for you because User-Agents values are highly unstable and change on a weekly basis. What is available is an extension point in CookiePolicy allowing you to plug in User-Agent specific logic. \r\n\r\nIn Startup.cs add the following\r\n```\r\nprivate void CheckSameSite(HttpContext httpContext, CookieOptions options) \r\n{ \r\n    if (options.SameSite == SameSiteMode.None) \r\n    { \r\n        var userAgent = httpContext.Request.Headers[\"User-Agent\"].ToString(); \r\n        // TODO: Use your User Agent library of choice here. \r\n        if (/* UserAgent doesn’t support new behavior */) \r\n        { \r\n               options.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Unspecified; \r\n        } \r\n    } \r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \r\n{ \r\n    services.Configure<CookiePolicyOptions>(options => \r\n    { \r\n        options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = SameSiteMode.Unspecified; \r\n        options.OnAppendCookie = cookieContext =>  \r\n            CheckSameSite(cookieContext.Context, cookieContext.CookieOptions); \r\n        options.OnDeleteCookie = cookieContext =>  \r\n            CheckSameSite(cookieContext.Context, cookieContext.CookieOptions); \r\n    }); \r\n} \r\n \r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app) \r\n{ \r\n    app.UseCookiePolicy(); // Before UseAuthentication or anything else that writes cookies. \r\n    app.UseAuthentication(); \r\n    // … \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpt-out switches:\r\nThere is a compat switch which enables you to temporarily opt-out of the new ASP.NET Core cookie behavior. Add a runtimeconfig.template.json file to your project containing: \r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  \"configProperties\": { \r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SuppressSameSiteNone\": \"true\" \r\n  } \r\n} \r\n```\r\nThis switch will be removed in the next major version.\r\n\r\nOther Versions:\r\nRelated SameSite patches are forthcoming for ASP.NET Core 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, Microsoft.Owin 4.1, and System.Web (.NET 4.7.2+).\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[SameSiteMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.samesitemode)\r\n[CookieOptions.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.cookieoptions.samesite)\r\n[CookieBuilder.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.cookiebuilder.samesite)\r\n[CookiePolicyOptions.MinimumSameSitePolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.cookiepolicyoptions.minimumsamesitepolicy) \r\n\r\nMicrosoft.Net.Http.Headers:\r\n[SameSiteMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.net.http.headers.samesitemode)\r\n[SetCookieHeaderValue.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.net.http.headers.setcookieheadervalue.samesite)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/390","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reacting to browser SameSite changes in 3.1.0-preview1, impacts OpenIdConnect\" (#390)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1273022650013499392","CreatedAt":"2020-06-16T22:40:26+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting in a few minutes - come join us!\n\nhttps://t.co/AyBuoJbJmc +\nhttps://t.co/pte0TupL83 https://t.co/XMN4B5okkf","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":15,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1272931752642633728","CreatedAt":"2020-06-16T16:39:14+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Get ready for this week’s #ASPNET Community Standup featuring @davidfowl and @sebastienros with some updates on 🚀Pe… https://t.co/wWpDLTkz7Z","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":18,"FavoriteCount":10,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1265352237712150528","CreatedAt":"2020-05-26T18:40:57+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Announcing Experimental Mobile Blazor Bindings May update\n\n📱Update to latest native mobile component versions in Xa… https://t.co/TlllNi9wqI","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":78,"FavoriteCount":37,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1265325854663442434","CreatedAt":"2020-05-26T16:56:07+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

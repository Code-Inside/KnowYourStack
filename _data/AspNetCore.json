Please describe the problem.\n\nI have a large-ish project with a dotnet backend, typescript frontend, redis, db etc - so naturally I'm going to reach for a Docker Compose stack. This works fairly well, except that as far as I can tell it's not possible to cleanly support debugging *and* hot reload in this scenario. I can either:\n- Disable hot reload, and use a docker attach debugging config. This works great, except as the project grows I end up spending significant time waiting on builds for minor changes, especially with multiple projects depending on each other.\n- Use hot reload, and give up on debugging. Maybe I'm missing something, but all attempts to attach give a \"Attaching a .NET debugger to this process is not allowed because code changes have been applied. The process must be restarted to allow debugging.\" error. Ideally, I'd run a preLaunch task to force a full restart, but the only way I've found to do that is \"press ctrl-r\" which I can't easily do to a running docker container.\n\nI've searched the docs and Google and haven't seen anything relating to this situation, but I can't imagine I'm the only one using dotnet core as one piece of a larger full-stack context. I think some additional docs around running dotnet in docker, and what's possible/not possible might be warranted. The dev experience with debugger attaching in general is really good, I feel like this is my last blocker to the ideal workflow.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI think there's a few possible fixes here:\n- Automatically restart fully when a debugger is attached, if there are hot changes applied. This seems like the most obvious, so I assume it's hard in some way.\n- Support debugging when there are hot changes\n- Support an alternate method to request a full reload than a keyboard shortcut that presumes you're running dotnet in a standard terminal context.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nA higher-level fix would be faster non-hot-reload builds - I'm not entirely clear what's taking so long in the first place. Is there a way to profile builds that my Googling hasn't surfaced?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61373","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support/documentation for .NET Core debugging & hot reload workflows in Docker\" (#61373)"},{"Id":"2977671672","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T18:34:16","Actor":"t03apt","Number":"61372","RawContent":null,"Title":"The Host initiated by WebApplicationFactory fails to terminate","State":"open","Body":"## Bug\nThe Host initiated by WebApplicationFactory fails to terminate.\n\n## Reproduce:\n\n### [Program.cs](https://github.com/t03apt/AppLifecycleTroubleshooting/blob/5f97b95396b819ba0a346ee147839a808729d584/WebApi/Program.cs)\n```csharp\n\nnamespace WebApi;\n\npublic partial class Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args) => CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();\n\n    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>\n        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\n            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>\n            {\n                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();\n            })\n            .ConfigureServices(services =>\n            {\n                services.Configure<HostOptions>(options =>\n                {\n                    options.ShutdownTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);\n                });\n            });\n}\n\npublic class Startup\n{\n    public static void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\n    {\n        app.UseRouting();\n        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { endpoints.MapHealthChecks(\"/health\"); });\n    }\n\n    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n    {\n        services.AddHealthChecks();\n        services.AddHostedService<MyBackgroundService>();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class MyBackgroundService(ILogger<MyBackgroundService> logger) : BackgroundService\n{\n    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)\n    {\n        await Task.Yield();\n\n        try\n        {\n            while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)\n            {\n                logger.LogInformation(\"My background service is running.\");\n                await Task.Delay(1000, stoppingToken);\n\n                throw new InvalidOperationException();\n            }\n        }\n        catch (OperationCanceledException) when (stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)\n        {\n            // ignore\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### [UnitTest1.cs](https://github.com/t03apt/AppLifecycleTroubleshooting/blob/5f97b95396b819ba0a346ee147839a808729d584/WebApiTests/UnitTest1.cs)\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\n\nnamespace WebApiTests\n{\n    public class UnitTest1 : IClassFixture<WebApplicationFactory<WebApi.Program>>\n    {\n        private readonly WebApplicationFactory<WebApi.Program> _factory;\n\n        public UnitTest1(WebApplicationFactory<WebApi.Program> factory)\n        {\n            _factory = factory;\n        }\n\n        [Fact]\n        public async Task ApplicationShouldShutdownGracefullyOnFailingHostedService()\n        {\n            // Arrange\n            var lifetime = _factory.Services.GetRequiredService<IHostApplicationLifetime>();\n\n            // Act\n            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));\n\n            // Assert\n            Assert.True(lifetime.ApplicationStopping.IsCancellationRequested, \"Expected lifetime.ApplicationStopping.IsCancellationRequested to be true\");\n            Assert.True(lifetime.ApplicationStopped.IsCancellationRequested, \"Expected lifetime.ApplicationStopped.IsCancellationRequested to be true\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61372","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The Host initiated by WebApplicationFactory fails to terminate\" (#61372)"},{"Id":"2977576253","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T17:51:24","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"61371","RawContent":null,"Title":"UB Build Failure: aspnetcore - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Runtime.SiteExtension\\project.assets.json' doesn't have a target for 'net462/win-x86","State":"open","Body":"**Issue:**\n\n```\nD:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\.dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-preview.4.25177.22\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets(266,5): error NETSDK1047: Assets file 'D:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\aspnetcore\\artifacts\\obj\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Runtime.SiteExtension\\project.assets.json' doesn't have a target for 'net462/win-x86'.

in Blazor Router / NotFound when AOT is enabled","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nUsing default Razor syntax with <Router> and <LayoutView> (as generated in standard Blazor templates) triggers trimming and AOT warnings when publishing with PublishTrimmed=true and PublishAot=true.\n\nFor example, this code:\n```\n<Router AppAssembly=\"@typeof(App).Assembly\">\n    <Found Context=\"routeData\">\n        <RouteView RouteData=\"@routeData\" DefaultLayout=\"@typeof(MainLayout)\" />\n        <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=\"@routeData\" Selector=\"h1\" />\n    </Found>\n    <NotFound>\n        <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>\n        <LayoutView Layout=\"@typeof(MainLayout)\">\n            <p role=\"alert\">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>\n        </LayoutView>\n    </NotFound>\n</Router>\n```\n\nproduces trimming warnings such as:\n\n```\nIL2110: Blazor.UI.App.<>c.<BuildRenderTree>b__0_1(RenderTreeBuilder): Field 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.LayoutView.<Layout>k__BackingField' with 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' is accessed via reflection.\nIL2111: LayoutView.WrapInLayout(Type, RenderFragment) is accessed via reflection and can't guarantee trim-safety.\n```\n\nThese warnings come from the standard boilerplate code, and there is no obvious way to annotate the Razor or suppress the reflection usage safely without manually refactoring the rendering logic.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe generated templates and idiomatic Razor code should either:\n- Avoid unsafe reflection, or\n- Automatically preserve required types/members (e.g., via linker config or DynamicDependency)\n- Or at least clearly document the required workaround\n\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a Blazor WebAssembly app.\n2. Use <LayoutView Layout=\"@typeof(MainLayout)\"> in a NotFound section of <Router>.\n3. In .csproj set:\n\n```\n<PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n    <InvariantGlobalization>true</InvariantGlobalization>\n    <RunAOTCompilation>true</RunAOTCompilation>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n4.

But when I deploy this to the production, where the number of requests is large, the app is down. Along with this I have a lot of the following exceptions: `System.ObjectDisposedException, Cannot access a closed Stream`. The exceptions point to the following line: `var currentPosition = context.Request.Body.Position;`\n\nI made some tests on my local machine, but I couldn't reproduce this behavior.\n\nI found a place where the metric writes: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/25ef4aa38b77974263cb10f6e9cbd10135f17b59/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/Internal/HostingApplication.cs#L93\n\n```\npublic void DisposeContext(Context context, Exception? exception)\n{\n\tvar httpContext = context.HttpContext!;\n\t_diagnostics.RequestEnd(httpContext, exception, context);\n\n\tif (_defaultHttpContextFactory != null)\n\t{\n\t\t_defaultHttpContextFactory.Dispose((DefaultHttpContext)httpContext);\n\n\t\tif (_defaultHttpContextFactory.HttpContextAccessor != null)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// Clear the HttpContext if the accessor was used. It's likely that the lifetime extends\n\t\t\t// past the end of the http request and we want to avoid changing the reference from under\n\t\t\t// consumers.\n\t\t\tcontext.HttpContext = null;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\telse\n\t{\n\t\t_httpContextFactory!.Dispose(httpContext);\n\t}\n\n\t_diagnostics.ContextDisposed(context);\n\n\t// Reset the context as it may be pooled\n\tcontext.Reset();\n}\n```\n\nLooking at the code above we can see that the metric writes before the `Dispose()` is called. The `RequestEnd()` method is synchronous, so it looks like everything should work fine. But it only looks... I put `Thread.Sleep()` inside the `OnMeasurementRecorded()` method and figured out that http response comes much faster than thread is actually sleeping.\n\nMy questions are:\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

To retain some authentication functionality in the asp.net implementation, I have added the followings in the migrated application.

Currently it seams that the chunk size is always `2^15=32768`\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like the constructor of `DotNetStreamReference` to have an optional parameter `ulong chunkSize` (or maybe `long`) so that the chunk size can be configured.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is related to my work on wrapping the `Streams` browser API in Blazor: https://github.com/KristofferStrube/Blazor.Streams","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44673","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Have chunk size as parameter for `DotNetStreamReference`.\" (#44673)"},{"Id":"1417877123","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-21T07:21:31","Actor":"davhdavh","Number":"44671","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor publish sometimes does not update compressed versions of linked files","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nBlazor publish sometimes does not update compressed versions of linked files.\r\n\r\nbuild log says:\r\n```\r\nUsing \"GZipCompress\" task from assembly \"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.100-rc.2.22477.23\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly\\targets\\..\\tools\\net472\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly.Tasks.dll\".\r\n...\r\nSkipping '...\\obj\\Release\\net7.0\\linked\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.dll' because 'obj\\Release\\net7.0\\compress\\n+2YGD1h.gz' is newer than '...\\obj\\Release\\net7.0\\linked\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.dll'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nobj\\Release\\net7.0\\linked\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.dll is 7.0.22.47602, 115,328 bytes, Modified: Monday, ‎September ‎26, ‎2022, ‏‎10:17:52 PM.

For the same reason, it also registers an `IPostConfigureOptions<AuthenticationOptions>` implementation that ensures the OpenIddict server handler is never registered as a default scheme in the options:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic void PostConfigure(string? name, AuthenticationOptions options)\r\n{\r\n    if (options is null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(options));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (!TryValidate(options.SchemeMap, options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme) ||\r\n        !TryValidate(options.SchemeMap, options.DefaultChallengeScheme) ||\r\n        !TryValidate(options.SchemeMap, options.DefaultForbidScheme) ||\r\n        !TryValidate(options.SchemeMap, options.DefaultScheme) ||\r\n        !TryValidate(options.SchemeMap, options.DefaultSignInScheme) ||\r\n        !TryValidate(options.SchemeMap, options.DefaultSignOutScheme))\r\n    {\r\n        throw new InvalidOperationException(SR.GetResourceString(SR.ID0109));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static bool TryValidate(IDictionary<string, AuthenticationSchemeBuilder> map, string? scheme)\r\n    {\r\n        // If the scheme was not set or if it cannot be found in the map, return true.\r\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(scheme) || !map.TryGetValue(scheme, out var builder))\r\n        {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return builder.HandlerType != typeof(OpenIddictServerAspNetCoreHandler);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTrying to call `AuthenticateAsync(OpenIddictServerAspNetCore.AuthenticationScheme)` for every request doesn't make sense: when OpenIddict detects you tried to call `AuthenticateAsync(OpenIddictServerAspNetCore.AuthenticationScheme)` on an unsupported endpoint, you get an `InvalidOperationException` that tells you you're doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, ASP.NET Core 7.0's \"use whatever authentication handler is present as the default scheme when none is set\" basically ends up calling `AuthenticateAsync(OpenIddictServerAspNetCore.AuthenticationScheme)` for every request when the OpenIddict server is the only authentication handler present in the handlers collection.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nWhile .NET 7.0's current previews include a `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.SuppressAutoDefaultScheme` switch to that logic off, it's very likely it will be removed in future versions, so a different approach should be considered to avoid such issues.\r\n\r\nPotential approches:\r\n  - Revert this change to use the same approach as in previous .NET versions.\r\n\r\n  - Add new methods to `IAuthenticationHandler` to allow determining whether the instance can be selected as a default scheme handler when none is set. Something like:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic interface IAuthenticationHandler\r\n{\r\n    // ...\r\n    Task<bool> CanBeUsedAsDefaultAuthenticateSchemeAsync(HttpContext context)\r\n        => Task.FromResult(true);\r\n    Task<bool> CanBeUsedAsDefaultChallengeSchemeAsync(HttpContext context)\r\n        => Task.FromResult(true);\r\n    Task<bool> CanBeUsedAsDefaultForbidSchemeAsync(HttpContext context)\r\n        => Task.FromResult(true);\r\n    Task<bool> CanBeUsedAsDefaultSignInSchemeAsync(HttpContext context)\r\n        => Task.FromResult(this is IAuthenticationSignInHandler);\r\n    Task<bool> CanBeUsedAsDefaultSignOutSchemeAsync(HttpContext context)\r\n        => Task.FromResult(this is IAuthenticationSignOutHandler);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @DamianEdwards ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44661","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ASP.NET Core 7.0's default authentication handler fallback breaks OpenIddict\" (#44661)"},{"Id":"1417350110","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-20T21:52:04","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"44667","RawContent":null,"Title":"Compression error in br encoding depending on razor cshtml format","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Compression-error-in-br-encoding-dependi/10175071)._\n\n---\n[regression] [worked-in:17.2]\r\nFormatting a div to a newline causes a compression error in the response.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Both contexts included services (`IServiceProvider`) and endpoint metadata (`IList<object>`).\r\n\r\n`EndpointMetadataContext` included the `MethodInfo` for the minimal route handler MVC action that took the implementing type as a parameter or returned it. `EndpointParameterMetadataContext` provided `ParameterInfo` and could only be used on parameter types.\n\n### New behavior\n\nNow in RC2, both interfaces' `PopulateMetadata` method take an `EndpointBuilder` as their second parameter. The `EndpointBuilder` provides access to the application services (`IServiceProvider`) and endpoint metadata (`IList<object>`) previously provided by `EndpointMetadataContext` and `EndpointParameterMetadataContext`.\r\n\r\nNow, `IEndpointMetadataProvider` takes a `MethodInfo` and `IEndpointParameterMetadataProvider` takes a `ParameterInfo` as their first parameter.\r\n\r\nBoth `EndpointMetadataContext` and `EndpointParameterMetadataContext` have been removed.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43125#issuecomment-1218534849 for an API diff.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe metadata providers now get access to more metadata like the `RoutePattern` (with a downcast) and `DisplayName` via the `EndpointBuilder`, and this allowed us to delete unnecessary context types.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nUpdate implementations of `IEndpointMetadataProvider` and `IEndpointParameterMetadataProvider` to access the information necessary from the new parameters.

Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable.

Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

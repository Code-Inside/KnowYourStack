Please describe.\r\n\r\nToday if you want to configure a TLS certificate for the host in code, you have to configure Kestrel directly using `WebApplicationBuilder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(...)`. Kestrel is the only server we ship that supports runtime configuration of certificates currently, but it would be nice to have a way to configure the certifcate(s) to be used by any `IServer` capable of using them.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice if you could configure TLS certificates with just the `WebApplication` like you can for `Urls`. Certificates can be configured per-endpoint in Kestrel (and even per-server-name using SNI), but associating certificates with endpoints and server names could prove complicated. This is especially true with the multiple places in both code and config you can define Kestrel endpoints. However, maybe we could support this for all endpoints with a known URL.\r\n\r\nTo support this in a way that is testable and could at least theoretically work with other `IServers` we should add a server feature interface. `IServerAddressesFeature` is the only other server feature that I know of in wide use.\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is.\r\nExample: I am trying to do [...] but [...]\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure I like this, but here's one possibility:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder\r\n{\r\n    public class WebApplication\r\n    {\r\n+        public X509Certificate2? DefaultCertificate { get; set; }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features\r\n{\r\n+    public interface IDefaultServerCertificateFeature\r\n+    {\r\n+        X509Certificate2? DefaultCertificate { get; set; }\r\n+    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is this would basically override the default/dev cert, but certificates configured for a specific Kestrel endpoint would be preferred.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like about this proposal is that it's yet another possible source for default certificates. We will have to make sure the prioritization of these sources is clear as possible, but adding more sources can only make clarifying this harder.\r\n\r\nI also think that loading a cert from a `.pfx` file in the content root directory will be unnecessarily difficult if we only have a X509Certificate2 property. Maybe we need to also add methods that take strings for the relative path and password.\r\n\r\n@Tratcher @davidfowl ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32124","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add better certificate configuration support to WebApplication\" (#32124)"},{"Id":"866461990","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-24T01:05:27","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"32123","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/6.0-preview4' => 'main'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/6.0-preview4 branch which have not been merged yet to main.

Server","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis template is useful to build consensus about whether work should be done, and if so, the high-level shape of how it should be approached. Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently there is an issue with Blazor Server-side where it is not reconnecting circuits automatically and losing connection on mobile browsers/PWA apps.\r\n\r\nSee #23340 #26985 \r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\n- Automatically reload page on `Reconnection attempt to the circuit was rejected by the server. This may indicate that the associated state is no longer available on the server.`\r\n- Automatically reload page on mobile browsers that lost connection (probably due to browser tab being suspended), see #23340 #26985 \r\n\r\n## In scope\r\n\r\n- Automatically refresh the page when circuit was rejected\r\n- Add `onReconnectionFailed` event\r\n- `onReconnectionFailed` could be used to automatically refresh the page instead of asking user to do that manually like in a screenshot shown below\r\n- Change `DefaultReconnectionHandler.attemptPeriodicReconnection` to try to reconnect first and then delay, instead of delaying first and then trying to reconnect.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This is primarily used to support runtime-compilation based scenarios.\r\n\r\nPrior to .NET 6, `PreserveCompilationContext` was configured to `true` for all apps that target the Razor (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor`) and Web (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`) apps.

This was not possible with the older API because there was no place to store the internal event subscriptions.

This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`. This will not affect any typical application code as it is only a detail of the low-level platform implementation.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe property `EventArgsType` described a nonstandard, Blazor-specific category name for groups of DOM event types. For example, the `click` and `mousedown` events were both mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `mouse`. Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`. There is no longer a need to supply a Blazor-specific category name, so the old property `EventArgsType` is removed.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nIn PR [#29993](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/29993) we have introduced support for custom event arguments classes. As part of this, we no longer rely on all events fitting into a predefined set of categories. The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

For example, if a razor class library defined a static web asset to be served under `/folder/file.txt` and the host placed a file under `wwwroot/folder/file.txt` the file on the server would silently override the file on the Razor Class Library or Blazor Webassembly application.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core will now correctly detect when this issue happens and inform of the conflict so that users can be aware and take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis was a bug in the implementation, we never intended for static web assets to be \"overridable\" by files on the wwwroot host of the project since that leads to errors that are hard to diagnose and can result in undefined behavior changes when applications are published.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason for a file on a Razor Class Library to conflict with a file on the host by default since they are prefixed with `_content/${PackageId}` unless we are discussing Blazor Webassembly applications, which get placed by default at the root of the host url space, which makes conflicts easier. (For example, Blazor Webassembly Applications contain a favicon.ico that the host might also include in their wwwroot folder).\r\n\r\nIf the source of the conflict is a file in a Razor Class Library it normally means there is some code that copies the assets from the library into the wwwroot folder of the project. We don't recommend developers doing that since it defeats one of the main goals of static web assets which is that files don't have to be copied around, which is fundamental to get updates on the browser when the contents are updated without having to trigger a new compilation.\r\n\r\nIf despite that you want to preserve this behavior and maintain the file on the host, you can do so by removing the file from the list of static web assets with a custom MSBuild target.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the file on the razor class library or the blazor webassembly file instead of the file from the host project, just remove the file from the host project.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updated validation logic for Static Web Assets\" (#443)"},{"Id":"724794249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T19:05:24","Actor":"tatti9018","Number":"442","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"Help with feature “Control Startup class activation”\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n            .ConfigureWebHost(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.UseStartup(context => new Startup(logger));\r\n            })\r\n            .Build();\r\n```\r\nWhen I use Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly”, I get error: ‘IHostBuilder’ does not contain a definition for ‘ConfigureWebHostDefaults’\r\nWhen I set Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, project see ConfigureWebHostDefaults, but project doesn’t work….","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/442","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work\" (#442)"},{"Id":"712253766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-30T20:21:51","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5","State":"open","Body":"## Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5\r\n\r\n.NET 5 introduces a variety of [new Blazor features](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514), some of which are not compatible with certain older browsers.

The functionality provided by these packages was based on the AzureAD v1.0 endpoint. \r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0 integration with AzureAD and AzureAD B2C authentication will be provided by [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web) which is based on Microsoft Identity Platform (formerly known as AzureAD v2.0 endpoint). As such, we are deprecating the old APIs in the AzureAD.UI and AzureADB2C.UI packages.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 Preview 8\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThese APIs were not Obsolete.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThey are now Obsolete.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe are migrating the functionality to MSAL APIs provided by Microsoft.Identity.Web, which is built from [this repository](https://github.com/azuread/microsoft-identity-web).\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nFollow the documentation at https://github.com/azuread/microsoft-identity-web/wiki.

Starting from ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1, all of those readonly public fields have changed to readonly public properties.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect this change to affect many developers because:\r\n\r\n * Any application or library that simply uses `.razor` files (or even manual `RenderTreeBuilder` calls) to define its components would not be referencing this type directly\r\n * The `RenderTreeFrame` type itself is regarded as an implementation detail, not intended for use outside the framework. ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later includes an analyzer that issues compiler warnings if the type is being used directly.\r\n * Even if you do reference `RenderTreeFrame` directly, this change is binary-breaking but not source-breaking. That is, your existing source code will still compile and behave properly. You will only encounter an issue if compiling against the 3.x framework and then running those binaries against the 5.0 RC1 and later framework.\r\n\r\n## Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1\r\n\r\n## Old behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` were defined as fields, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\n## New behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` are defined as properties with the same names as before, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\nIf older precompiled code has not been recompiled since this change, it may throw an exception similar to *MissingFieldException: Field not found: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame.FrameType'*.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary in order to implement some high-impact performance improvements in Blazor component rendering on ASP.NET Core 5.0 while retaining the same level of safety and encapsulation as before.\r\n\r\n## Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Blazor developers will not be affected and do not need to take action. This is most likely to affect library/package authors, but still only rarely. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* If you are developing an application, and either staying on ASP.NET Core 3.x or upgrading to 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to make any changes to your own code.\r\n   * However if you depend on a library that needs to upgrade to account for this change, then you would need to update to a newer version of that library.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support only ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to take any action. Just ensure that your `csproj` declares the `TargetFramework` value `net5.0`.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support both ASP.NET Core 3.x *and* 5.0, then check whether or not your code attempts to read any of the members of `RenderTreeFrame` (for example, evaluating `someRenderTreeFrame.FrameType`).\r\n    * Most libraries will not do that. This includes libraries that contain `.razor` components. In this case you don't need to take any action.\r\n    * However, if your library does do that, then you will need to use multitargeting to support both `netstandard2.1` and `net5.0`. First, in your `csproj`, replace the existing `<TargetFramework>` with `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`. Then instead of referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` with a fixed version number such as 3.0.0, use a conditional reference to account for both versions you wish to support. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"3.0.0\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"5.0.0-rc.1.*\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' != 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further clarification, see this [diff showing how @jsakamoto already upgraded his `Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement` library in this way](https://github.com/jsakamoto/Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement/commit/090df430ba725f9420d412753db8104e8c32bf51).\r\n\r\n## Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fields on RenderTreeFrame have become properties\" (#438)"},{"Id":"696062913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T17:46:46","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the default behavior of `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBy default, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found (i.e. the exception handler returns a 404) when the middleware executes. To allow 404 responses to be returned by the exception handler, please configure the option `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. When this option is set to true, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run.

The functionality will instead be provided by `DatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter` and its extension methods instead.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\n`DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware` and its associated extension methods were not obsolete.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n`DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware` and its associated extension methods are now obsolete.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe are migrating the existing database error page middleware to the new extensible API for `DeveloperExceptionPage`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\n1. Remove uses of `DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware`in your app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n    {\r\n        app.UseDatabaseErrorPage();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Ensure `DeveloperExeptionPage` and `MigrationsEndpoint` are added to your app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n    {\r\n        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\r\n        app.UseMigrationsEndPoint();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add `DatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter` to your services:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n{\r\n    services.AddDatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter();\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n  [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.diagnostics.entityframeworkcore.databaseerrorpagemiddleware)\r\n  [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.DatabaseErrorPageExtensions.UseDatabaseErrorPage`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.databaseerrorpageextensions.usedatabaseerrorpage)\r\n\r\nSee discussion at: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24987\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/432","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting DatabaseErrorPage middleware\" (#432)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1384552432710029321","CreatedAt":"2021-04-20T16:59:58+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Community Standup - https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Core updates in .NET 6 - Chat live at… https://t.co/F5kdLCLiKG","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1384552117210214406","CreatedAt":"2021-04-20T16:58:43+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

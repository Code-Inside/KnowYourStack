The Blazor hosting documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-6.0#compression) recommends that in this case developers use a Javascript Brotli implementation to serve up dotnet.wasm.br and friends. \r\n\r\nI've tried this in a trivial project (https://github.com/gulbanana/stains/commit/476164ce25b1e2dd257ff9392a98861311449452). In my unscientific experiment, decode.min.js works correctly and reduces the wire size considerably, from 2.8 MB transferred to 1.6 MB transferred... but the point of reducing bandwidth cost is to reduce loading time, and it doesn't do that. The overhead (an extra script, no autostart, in-JS decoding...) means that the Brotli-compressed version is _slower_ to load - 2.1 seconds instead of 2.0.\r\n\r\nWithout decode.min.js: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1612285/142971853-a3b18586-40a1-440e-baac-f7a9d973cb27.png)\r\nWith decode.min.js: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1612285/142971829-5012c677-e7a9-404b-ad59-fe46d22e0f3b.png)\r\n\r\nThis is actually the best result - I've seen load times as slow as 3.5 sec for the compressed version, but variance is high. What worries me is that I am using a fast computer. It's a Ryzen 5900x CPU, which should be able to execute a compression algorithm in Javascript quite quickly... what about slow mobile devices? Will they actually benefit from fallback-based decompression, or would they be better off to take the filesize hit and load the larger uncompressed runtime?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/38587","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor+WASM+Static hosting: Is the advice to use a fallback Brotli decoder correct?\" (#38587)"},{"Id":"1060776079","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-23T02:28:58","Actor":"OriginatorStar","Number":"38586","RawContent":null,"Title":"> I am trying to access IWebHostEnvironment in a class library, referenced by my web project.

Support SkipStatusCodePages on endpoints and authorized routes","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/10317 identifies an issue where the behavior of the `AuthorizationMiddleware` circumvents the filter logic in `SkipStatusCodeAttribute` and results in the `StatusCodePageMiddleware` being executed when it shouldn't and masking the underlying 401 from the `AuthorizationMiddleware`.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to resolve this issue by removing the dependency on the `IFilter` execution order from the `SkipStatusCodeAttribute` by introducing an `ISkipStatusCodesMetadata` interface.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Metadata;\r\n\r\npublic interface ISkipStatusCodePagesMetadata\r\n{\r\n    bool Enabled { get; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- public class SkipStatusCodePagesAttribute : Attribute, IResourceFilter\r\n+ public class SkipStatusCodePagesAttribute : Attribute, IResourceFilter, ISkipStatusCodePagesMetadata\r\n{\r\n+  public bool Enabled { get; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\napp.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>\r\n{\r\n    endpoints.MapGet(\"/\", [SkipStatusCodePages] (c) =>\r\n    {\r\n        c.Response.StatusCode = 404;\r\n        return

call either the \"WeatherForecastController\" or \"GreeterService\", and during the constructor call you will see that it will log an error as it has more then one item in the list, and then throw the

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

The options `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` no longer exist, and some additional options now exist.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously to use the MessagePack hub protocol in the browser you needed to include 3 script references\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/msgpack5/msgpack5.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr-protocol-msgpack.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition the `msgpack5` package was downloaded to your `node_modules` so you could use it in your app if you wanted.\r\n\r\n`MessagePackOptions` had `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` properties, but doesn't anymore.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nTo use the MessagePack hub protocol in the browser you now only need 2 script references\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr-protocol-msgpack.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you will have the `@msgpack/msgpack` package downloaded to your `node_modules` if you want to use the directly in your app.\r\n\r\n`MessagePackOptions` has new properties and removed the `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` properties.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nReduced asset size, reduced complexity to consume the package, and more customizability.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you were previously using `msgpack5` in your app, you will need to add a direct reference to the library in your package.json.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nRemoved `MessagePackOptions.disableTimestampEncoding`\r\nRemoved `MessagePackOptions.forceFloat64`\r\n\r\n### Discussion issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30471\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/454","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Changed MessagePack library in @microsoft/signalr-protocol-msgpack javascript library\" (#454)"},{"Id":"814357042","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T11:05:37","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"453","RawContent":null,"Title":"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName","State":"open","Body":"## WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\r\n\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.WebEventDescriptor` class is part of Blazor's internal protocol for communicating events from JavaScript into .NET. This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`. This will not affect any typical application code as it is only a detail of the low-level platform implementation.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe property `EventArgsType` described a nonstandard, Blazor-specific category name for groups of DOM event types. For example, the `click` and `mousedown` events were both mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `mouse`. Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`. There is no longer a need to supply a Blazor-specific category name, so the old property `EventArgsType` is removed.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nIn PR [#29993](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/29993) we have introduced support for custom event arguments classes. As part of this, we no longer rely on all events fitting into a predefined set of categories. The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

This is being fixed in .NET 6.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nHTTP/2 connection closed log messages:\r\n\r\nName: Http2ConnectionClosed (unchanged)\r\nID: 36 (before) -> 48 (after)\r\n\r\nHTTP/2 frame sending log messages:\r\n\r\nName: Http2FrameReceived (before) -> Http2FrameSending (after)\r\nID: 37 (before) -> 49 (after)\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nLog IDs and names should be unique so different message types can be identified.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you have code or configuration that references the old IDs and names, update those references use the new IDs and names.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/447","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Kestrel logging ID changes\" (#447)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1462952495873871877","CreatedAt":"2021-11-23T01:13:50+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"On this week's #ASPNET Community Standup:\n\n🥳 .NET Conf | Web Dev recap\n🌟Featuring Jeff Fritz &amp; Jon Galloway\n\n🗓Tuesd… https://t.co/BNXmptVAK5","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":8,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1458929984496553985","CreatedAt":"2021-11-11T22:49:48+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"🏁 Get started with minimal API for .NET 6 by @chris_noring \n\n🚀 Using minimal API, you can create a Web API in just… https://t.co/WWGxWBgDJe","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":21,"FavoriteCount":6,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1457753355674025985","CreatedAt":"2021-11-08T16:54:18+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"🚀Announcing #AspNetCore in .NET 6!\n\n🔁Hot reload\n🤏Minimal APIs\n⏬Async streaming\n5️⃣Bootstrap 5.1\n🔥Lots of Blazor upd… https://t.co/gk83Ob7gLv","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":428,"FavoriteCount":158,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1455288347501350912","CreatedAt":"2021-11-01T21:39:14+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"No #AspNet Community Standup this week, we're all getting ready for #dotNETConf!\n\nYou can catch all our past weekly… https://t.co/jLdbxmVifY","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":18,"FavoriteCount":4,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1455214336431910915","CreatedAt":"2021-11-01T16:45:09+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"➡️POSTED: Build client web assets for your Razor Class Library\n\nLearn how to integrate npm and webpack into the bui… https://t.co/4wojvVofjR","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":23,"FavoriteCount":10,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1454136524224802820","CreatedAt":"2021-10-29T17:22:18+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"🎉 #dotNETConf is coming November 9 - 11! 🎉 \n\n👏 Day 1️⃣ All the big news about .NET 6\n💪 Day 2️⃣ Dive deep into all t… https://t.co/5DoPRjBfPg","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":73,"FavoriteCount":31,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1453043796380246018","CreatedAt":"2021-10-26T17:00:11+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Community Standup - Blazor Native Interop with SkiaSharp - Chat live at… https://t.co/wJf8YEp7Tb","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":4,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1453042843572789258","CreatedAt":"2021-10-26T16:56:24+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

Sometimes the validation message does not display. 100% of the time the `FieldCssClass` will not be set correctly.\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nValidation messages and css classes should still be applied when the underlying model for a input component changes.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nConsider a model like this\n```csharp\npublic class ComplexModel\n{\n    public string Property1 { get; set; }\n\n    public ChildModel Child { get; set; } = new();\n}\n\npublic class ChildModel\n{\n    [Required]\n    public string?

This enables host environments to intercept and handle navigation events as part of the initialization process, providing greater flexibility for scenarios such as custom navigation handling, logging, or integration with platform-specific navigation systems.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing\n{\n    public interface IHostEnvironmentNavigationManager\n    {\n-       void Initialize(string baseUri, string uri);\n+       void Initialize(string baseUri, string uri, Func<string, Task> onNavigateTo);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\n// Example: Custom navigation interception during initialization\nhostEnvironmentNavigationManager.Initialize(\n    baseUri: \"https://example.com/\",\n    uri: \"https://example.com/app/page\",\n    onNavigateTo: async (targetUri) =>\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Navigating to: {targetUri}\");\n        // Perform custom logic, e.g., analytics, permission checks, etc.\n        await Task.CompletedTask;\n    }\n);\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n- An alternative could have been to expose a separate event or registration method, but providing the callback directly in Initialize ensures it is set up before any navigation occurs.\n\n## Risks\n\n- Existing consumers of the interface must ensure they use the correct overload for their scenario; however, the original overload remains for backward compatibility.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62415","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"API proposal for `IHostEnvironmentNavigationManager.Initialize`\" (#62415)"},{"Id":"3159745301","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-19T10:06:12","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"62414","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wrap OnNavigateTo callback with GetErrorHandledTask for proper exception logging","State":"open","Body":"Exceptions thrown in the `OnNavigateTo` callback were not being logged because the callback was passed directly to `NavigationManager.Initialize()` without error handling.

Previously, this class did not expose the unmatched component path, limiting its usefulness for scenarios where the path is needed—such as in server-side rendering (SSR) streaming, where the framework or event listeners may need to fetch and render the correct “not found” component for a specific route.\n\nThis change adds a url parameter to the `NotFoundEventArgs` constructor and a `Path` property to the class. This allows internal components, such as the `NavigationManager` and event listeners, to pass and access the unmatched route, enabling rendering in SSR streaming scenarios. The naming is not consistent and should be unified to probably `path` or `route` or similar.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing\n{\n    public class NotFoundEventArgs\n    {\n-       public NotFoundEventArgs();\n+       public NotFoundEventArgs(string url);\n\n+       public string Path { get; }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\n// User's custom router code subscribes to `OnNotFound`\nNavigationManager?.OnNotFound += HandleNotFound;\n\n// User's component rises not found:\nNavigationManager.NotFound();\n\n// internally, `NavigationManager` triggers the `NotFound` event with the not-found-route\n// var args = new NotFoundEventArgs(NotFoundPageRoute);\n// OnNavigateNotFound?.Invoke(args);\n\n// Event listeners can now access the unmatched path to e.g. handle rendering in the case when streaming has started:\nvoid HandleNotFound(NotFoundEventArgs args)\n{\n    // Use args.Path to fetch or render the correct NotFound component for SSR streaming\n    if (\n    var fetchUrl = $\"/{NavigationManager.BaseUri}/{args.Path}\";\n    // Fetch and render logic:\n}\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n- Previously, `NotFoundEventArgs` did not provide the not-found path, so we were always using a fixed path \"not-found\", forcing users to define not found component with exactly this route, without a way to customize it.\n\n## Risks\n\n- The path can be confused with unmatched path of component that called `NavigationManager.NotFound()`. From this reason, better naming would be needed.\n- If existing code uses the parameterless constructor, it may need to be updated to use the new constructor with the url parameter.

Currently, the middleware allows re-executing the pipeline for a given path, but it does not provide a way to control whether a new DI scope is created for the re-executed request. This can be important for scenarios where error handling requires a fresh scope, such as when using scoped services that should not be shared between the original and re-executed requests.\n\nThis proposal introduces a new property, `CreateScopeForErrors`, on `StatusCodePagesOptions`, and a new overload of `UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute` that allows configuring this behavior.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder\n{\n    public class StatusCodePagesOptions\n    {\n+       public bool CreateScopeForErrors { get; set; }\n    }\n\n    public static class StatusCodePagesExtensions\n    {\n+       public static IApplicationBuilder UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(\n+           this IApplicationBuilder app,\n+           string pathFormat,\n+           bool createScopeForErrors,\n+           string? queryFormat = null);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\napp.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(\n    \"/error/{0}\",\n    createScopeForErrors: true,\n    queryFormat: \"?originalPath={1}\"\n);\n```\nThis will re-execute the pipeline for the `/error/{statusCode}` path, creating a new DI scope for the error handling request.\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n- The CreateScopeForErrors property could have been added only to the options, requiring users to configure it via app.UseStatusCodePages(options => { ... }). However, providing an overload on the extension method makes it easier to opt-in for the most common scenario.\n- Other frameworks often handle error re-execution differently, but this approach is consistent with ASP.NET Core's middleware and DI patterns.\n\n## Risks\n\n- Creating a new DI scope for error handling may have performance implications if used excessively, but it is opt-in and should be used when isolation is required.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

For example, \"foobar\" will be treated as the default scheme in the code below.\r\n```\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddOAuth(\"foobar\");\r\n```\r\nThis change might expose unintended behavior changes in applications, such as authentication options being validated earlier than expected.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n.NET 7 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously, when users did not provide a default scheme in the `AddAuthentication` call, no default scheme was set.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis impacted the behavior of authentication handlers in the application layer.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nMoving forward, if (and only if) a _single_ scheme is registered in an application, that scheme will be treated as the default. In the code below, the `CookieDefaults.AuthenticationScheme` will be treated as the default scheme.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the code snippet below, no default will be set because multiple schemes are registered.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie().AddJwtBearer();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nTo reduce boilerplate when configuring authentication and set up sensible defaults.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe change only impacts applications with a single scheme registered. For those scenarios, it's recommended to ensure that your application is prepared to handle the assumption that a single scheme is the default. For example, the options associated with that scheme should be configured correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.SuppressAutoDefaultScheme` app context flag.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Changes in default authentication scheme handling for ASP.NET Core\" (#490)"},{"Id":"1287742787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T18:44:22","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"488","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs detailed in dotnet/aspnetcore#42413, the file-serving middleware (`DefaultFilesMiddleware`, `DirectoryBrowserMiddleware`, and `StaticFileMiddleware`) have been updated to no longer no-op (i.e. defer to the next middleware in the pipeline) in the case that there is an active endpoint with a `null` request delegate.\r\n\r\nPR that makes the change: dotnet/aspnetcore#42458\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nPreviously, if the current request had an active endpoint, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint() != null`, the file-serving middleware would perform no action and simply delegate to the next middleware in the request pipeline.\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe file-serving middleware will now only perform no action if there is an active endpoint and its `RequestDelegate` property value is not `null`, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint()?.RequestDelegate is not null`.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThis change will enable endpoints to be active in the request for the purposes of setting and sharing metadata with middleware that are endpoint-aware so that they can perform their intended function, while allowing other middleware (like the file-serving middleware) that would usually defer their behavior when an endpoint is active to also function.\r\n\r\nFor example, an endpoint with a `null` request delegate containing authorization metadata can be set as the active endpoint for a request, causing the `AuthorizationMiddleware` to enforce authorization requirements, which if satisfied would allow the `StaticFileMiddleware` to serve the requested files.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you are relying on setting an active endpoint on the request to suppress the behavior of the file-serving middleware, ensure that the endpoint has a non-null value set for its `RequestDelegate` property.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseStaticFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDefaultFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDirectoryBrowser()`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active\" (#488)"},{"Id":"1278667050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T16:03:03","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"487","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Unit testing SignalR Hubs may need updating","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`IHubClients` and `IHubCallerClients` now hide interface members `IClientProxy Client(string connectionId);` and `IClientProxy Caller { get;

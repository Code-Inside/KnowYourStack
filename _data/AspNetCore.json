It's not configurable with Identity UI, but you can more easily override razor pages than these endpoints. And you can scaffold them out. You *could* parse out the code in your `IEmailSender` and do whatever, but that'd obviously be very fragile.\r\n>\r\n> I think in the future we might have a higher-level abstraction with methods like `SendEmailConfirmationAsync` and `SendPasswordResetAsync` and a `TUser` parameter.

Maybe the code in Identity UI or `MapIdentityApi` will have the need to specify more parameters than just the recipient and email confirmation link. In that case, we'd probably add more DIMs, but it would be less clear which ones are actually used.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50298","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make IEmailSender more easily customizable\" (#50298)"},{"Id":"1864005001","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-23T21:00:05","Actor":"halter73","Number":"50297","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use absolute URLs for confirmation emails","State":"open","Body":"This PR updates the MapIdentityApi endpoints that send confirmation emails to use absolute URLs.

large request to a kestrel API","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen posting a large request body (> 300MB) to a kestrel based API we almost always get the error \"an existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host\", but it only occurs when using negotiate auth and isn't reproducible with anonymous. I eventually found issue #6986 which pointed me to what is happening:\r\n\r\n1. Client posts Negotiate request without credentials\r\n2. Server responds with a 401 challenge\r\n3. Kestrel tries to drain the request body, but as it's a lot of data this hits the 5 second timeout and it kills the connection\r\n4. Client can't respond to the challenge because the connection has been killed\r\n\r\nI've confirmed the workaround on that issue works, but it isn't really a suitable solution. For obvious reasons we don't want to have to spend resources on consuming the entire content of every unauthenticated request we receive, and it doesn't seem reasonable that we should have to receive the entire content of a request from the client multiple times when we're negotiating authentication.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen responding to a request with a 401 negotiate challenge we shouldn't have to consume the entire request body, and so it shouldn't kill the connection if reading that body takes more than 5 seconds.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n7.0.1\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50289","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Negotiate auth leads to disconnection when posting large request to a kestrel API\" (#50289)"},{"Id":"1863847896","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-23T18:51:23","Actor":"bruno-garcia","Number":"50294","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor - WebAssembly `build_id` section","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

The first thing that happens to throw is `NavigationManager.Initialize` (as reported at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49456)\r\n * The system falls back on showing the standard error page\r\n\r\n## Difficulties\r\n\r\nThis isn't straightforward to resolve for two main reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It really isn't valid to reinitialize or even reuse the same scoped services when re-running the pipeline. The concept of re-running the pipeline without creating a new DI scope is extremely dubious since by definition, the old DI scope is now in an undefined error state -  for security, Blazor Server is extremely careful not to let things keep running once they get into an undefined state.\r\n    * Possible solution: We could change `RazorComponentEndpointInvoker` to guarantee we create a new DI scope for the error endpoint. This would be inconsistent with MVC etc but at least safer. And would solve the double-initialization exceptions.\r\n2. Even if we can make the endpoint render, it's going to behave badly if you have an interactive router in your layout. Consider:\r\n   * Some Razor Component endpoint at `/MyComponentThatThrows` throws an unhandled exception\r\n   * The error middleware runs `Error.razor`, which uses the same `Layout.razor`, which contains a `@rendermode=Server` router and `<script src=\"blazor.web.js\"></script>`\r\n   * The error page starts up a new circuit and runs the router on the server.\r\n   * It will still see the current URL `/MyComponentThatThrows` and hence now re-runs the same component that throws a second time\r\n   * Possible solution: We somehow would have to emit info into the error page markup to tell the JS-side code *not* to start any interactive runtime. We might get away with just putting that into the default project template but it would be nasty and error prone if people try to create their own error page from scratch.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50287","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support Razor Component endpoints for UseExceptionHandler\" (#50287)"},{"Id":"1863011844","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-23T10:07:58","Actor":"pedroveiga99","Number":"50286","RawContent":null,"Title":"Navigate to a different page from SignalR hub event handler","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI'm trying to navigate to a different page using `NavigationManager.NavigateTo` from within a SignalR hub event handler in a Blazor WebAssembly application, but is encountering an assertion error. \r\n\r\nThis is a simplified code snippet of what I'm doing.\r\n```\r\nprotected async override Task OnInitializedAsync()\r\n{\r\n    hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n        // other hub configurations\r\n        .Build();\r\n\r\n    hubConnection.On(\"SomeMessage\", async () =>\r\n    {\r\n        NavigationManager.NavigateTo(\"/somepage\");\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    await hubConnection.StartAsync();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd I got this errror in the browser console.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet.7.0.5.xiq5d284cr.js:5 Error: [MONO] * Assertion at /__w/1/s/src/mono/mono/metadata/class.c:2112, condition `<disabled>' not met\r\n\r\nat xe (dotnet.7.0.5.xiq5d284cr.js:5:509)\r\nat Object.je (dotnet.7.0.5.xiq5d284cr.js:5:792)\r\nat _mono_wasm_trace_logger (dotnet.7.0.5.xiq5d284cr.js:14:104923)\r\nat 00992dae:0x9a48\r\nat 00992dae:0xa5a90\r\nat 00992dae:0x1bfe89\r\nat 00992dae:0x1bff18\r\nat 00992dae:0x1bff5b\r\nat 00992dae:0x1bff2e\r\nat 00992dae:0x38f27\r\n```\r\n I already tried calling the navigation inside InvokeAsync(); I tried creating an EventCallback in the OnInitialized method and then registering this as the handler.

In this case, the name is explicitly configured as \"Bearer,\" causing it to deviate from the default name of string.Empty.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT.

These are some possible options that will keep the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return Accepted(new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status202Accepted, new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic Model Get()\r\n{\r\n   Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n   return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC/API Controller actions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/485","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ActionResult<T> set StatusCode to 200\" (#485)"},{"Id":"1149914360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T20:33:05","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"482","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\n\nStarting in .NET 7, Blazor components use [`ActivatorUtilities`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities) to instantiate components. This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

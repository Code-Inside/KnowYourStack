Initially options will only be used to pass the owner of the factory, which is used in diagnostics.\n\nThe owner in telemetry allows memory pools used by different servers (iis, httpsys, kestrel) or libraries to be viewed separately when there are multiple memory pools in the same app.\n\nIn the future more options could be passed (eviction options like timer frequency?) but none are planned for now.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections;\n\npublic interface IMemoryPoolFactory<T>\n{\n-    MemoryPool<T> Create();\n+    MemoryPool<T> Create(MemoryPoolOptions? options = null);\n}\n\n+ public class MemoryPoolOptions\n+ {\n+     public string? Owner { get; set; }\n+ }\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```\npublic class MyType(IMemoryPoolFactory<byte> memoryPoolFactory)\n{\n    private readonly MemoryPool<byte> _pool = memoryPoolFactory.Create(new { Owner = \"contoso\" });\n}\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n* `MemoryPool<T> Create(MemoryPoolOptions? options = null)` parameter is optional. Decided to use optional parameter to avoid users having to pass empty options.\n* `MemoryPoolOptions` is no sealed in case factory implementions want to extend it with new values.\n\n## Risks\n\n<!--\nPlease mention any risks that to your knowledge the API proposal might entail, such as breaking changes, performance regressions, etc.\n-->\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API review] IMemoryPoolFactory options\" (#63085)"},{"Id":"3286561569","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-03T17:59:31","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"63073","RawContent":null,"Title":"Quarantine OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant","State":"closed","Body":"## Failing Test(s)\n\n- OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant\n\n## Error Message\n\n```text\nOpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant [FAIL]\n2025-08-01T18:51:32.8876671Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.69]       VerifyException : Directory: /datadisks/disk1/work/B6F109EF/w/A63E0941/e/Integration/snapshots\n2025-08-01T18:51:32.8904502Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.70]       NotEqual:\n2025-08-01T18:51:32.8932444Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.70]         - Received: OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant.received.txt\n2025-08-01T18:51:32.8960384Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.70]           Verified: OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant.verified.txt\n2025-08-01T18:51:32.8988075Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.71]       \n2025-08-01T18:51:32.9013181Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.71]       FileContent:\n2025-08-01T18:51:32.9024660Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.71]       \n2025-08-01T18:51:32.9044556Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.71]       NotEqual:\n2025-08-01T18:51:32.9050578Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.71]       \n2025-08-01T18:51:32.9084535Z [xUnit.net 00:00:10.71]       Received: OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant.received.txt\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Build\n\n- https://dev.azure.com/dnceng-public/public/_build/results?buildId=1111541&view=results\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63073","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Quarantine OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant\" (#63073)"},{"Id":"3286939723","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-03T17:59:30","Actor":"martincostello","Number":"63077","RawContent":null,"Title":"[OpenApi] Update snapshot","State":"closed","Body":"# Update snapshot\r\n\r\nFix OpenAPI snapshot.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nPick up changes from #62988 that got missed as the PR wasn't up-to-date with main.\r\n\r\nFixes #63073.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/63077","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[OpenApi] Update snapshot\" (#63077)"},{"Id":"3287295946","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-03T15:59:14","Actor":"AArnott","Number":"63084","RawContent":null,"Title":"IInvocationBinder throws or returns empty array inconsistently","State":"open","Body":"In writing my own `IHubProtocol` implementation, I found that when a method is invoked, there is no good way to determine whether a method exists with the `target` name to invoke.

Please describe the problem.\n\nThe way middleware is injected into the request execution pipeline is confusing and unintuitive. This is often confusing for both junior and senior developers as there are subtleties that are only found if you take the time and initiative to carefully read the related documentation, which in itself is confusing as the documentation relating to how all of the different components of the request execution pipeline interact together is spread out across different pages and sections of the ASP.NET documentation.\n\nIn the [routing documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-9.0), there's even a mention:\n\n> Apps typically don't need to call UseRouting or UseEndpoints. [WebApplicationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.webapplicationbuilder) configures a middleware pipeline that wraps middleware added in Program.cs with UseRouting and UseEndpoints.\n\nSlightly below it an another mention:\n\n> If the preceding example didn't include a call to UseRouting, the custom middleware would run after the route matching middleware.\n\nIn fact, considering that the term _endpoint_ is well understood by most developers as simply _being the destination route that gets served by the server_, most .NET developer don't naturally associate `UseEndpoints` with Minimal APIs due to the aforementioned fact that it is not required to be explicitly called for minimal API endpoints to function.\n\n`UseRouting` is also something that is most likely better understood by the developers and maintainers of the ASP.NET stack itself then by the average .NET developer. The documentation is sort of vague as to what function it actually does and how it's placement influences the rest of the request pipeline as explicitly calling it is optional and it doesn't seem to matter where it's placed as behavior does not appear to change regardless of where it's placed.\n\nSome of the ordering of the middleware is so unintuitive that I still have to refer to [the middleware order diagram](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-9.0#middleware-order) to be able to remember that `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization` have to go after `UseRouting`.\n\nThe current new Web API project further reinforces the implicit implementation of the minimal API middleware as there's no mention of either `UseRouting` nor `UseEndpoints`. The template itself doesn't even conform to the current documentation nor expectations as the `MapOpenApi` call is placed before `UseHttpsRedirection`.\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\n// Add services to the container.\n// Learn more about configuring OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnet/openapi\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenApi();\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\n// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\nif (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())\n{\n    app.MapOpenApi();\n}\n\napp.UseHttpsRedirection();\n\nvar summaries = new[] { \"Freezing\", \"Bracing\", \"Chilly\", \"Cool\", \"Mild\", \"Warm\", \"Balmy\", \"Hot\", \"Sweltering\", \"Scorching\" };\n\napp.MapGet(\"/weatherforecast\", () =>\n        {\n            var forecast = Enumerable.Range(1, 5)\n                .Select(index => new WeatherForecast(DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddDays(index)), Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),\n                        summaries[Random.Shared.Next(summaries.Length)]\n                    )\n                )\n                .ToArray();\n            return forecast;\n        }\n    )\n    .WithName(\"GetWeatherForecast\");\n\napp.Run();\n\nrecord WeatherForecast(DateOnly Date, int TemperatureC, string? Summary)\n{\n    public int TemperatureF => 32 + (int)(TemperatureC / 0.5556);\n}\n```\n\nIn my experience, most developers do not typically or instinctively refer to documentation during their day to day development, and this is further exacerbated in our new reality which is strongly AI-assisted. Request pipeline ordering is typically something that will lead most developers down a confusing debugging path that will likely end up with a hacky patch instead of simply adding the proper middleware hooks at the right place to ensure predictable and intuitive routing out of the box. I still don't comprehend why `UseRouting` wouldn't go before `UseStaticFiles` when static files are also part of the routing decisions.\n\nWith the current defaults, behavior will not reflect intention and a single line can introduce bugs that the developer may not understand.\n\nAs a simple example, if we imagine the following fictitious web app:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Minimal API Response\");\n\napp.Use((context, next) =>\n    {\n        if (context.Request.Path == \"/\")\n        {\n            context.Response.StatusCode = 200;\n            context.Response.ContentType = \"text/plain\";\n            context.Response.WriteAsync(\"Middleware Response\");\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        }\n        \n        return next();\n    }\n);\n\napp.Run();\n```\n\nThe expectation by a developer unfamiliar with the ASP.NET request pipeline is that the minimal API endpoint would trigger first and \"Minimal API Response\" sent back. The actual behavior is that \"Middleware Response\" is returned.\n\nIf a hook to `next()` is added after the response in the middleware as such:\n\n```csharp\napp.Use((context, next) =>\n    {\n        if (context.Request.Path == \"/\")\n        {\n            context.Response.StatusCode = 200;\n            context.Response.ContentType = \"text/plain\";\n            context.Response.WriteAsync(\"Middleware Response\");\n            next(); // Single line added here\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        }\n        \n        return next();\n    }\n);\n```\n\nThen the response becomes \"Middleware ResponseMinimal API Response\".\n\nOnly once the proper middleware hooks are in place does the behavior represent expectations:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\napp.UseRouting();\n\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Minimal API Response\");\n\napp.UseEndpoints(_ => { });\n\napp.Use((context, next) =>\n    {\n        if (context.Request.Path == \"/\")\n        {\n            context.Response.StatusCode = 200;\n            context.Response.ContentType = \"text/plain\";\n            context.Response.WriteAsync(\"Middleware Response\");\n            next();\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        }\n        \n        return next();\n    }\n);\n\napp.Run();\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nProposed solutions and ideas:\n- Improve documentation that better explains `UseRouting`, it's purpose and why its ordering matters.\n- Improve documentation that better explains `UseStaticFiles` and why it's not affected by `UseRouting`.\n- Add a dedicated request pipeline documentation page that gathers all of the different aspects of middleware routing currently spread throughout various pages of documentation.\n- Add an overload to `UseEndpoints()` that doesn't require passing an empty function (ie: `app.UseEndpoints(_ => { });`).\n- Add additonal comments to the default .NET web templates commenting out various middlewares that are often used in the proper locations where they should be used with links to the related documentation.\n\n#### Example proposal for the Web API template\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\n// Add services to the container.\n\n// Learn more about configuring OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnet/openapi\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenApi();\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\n// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\n// To learn more about middleware orderings and the various middleware types, see the documentation above each method.\n\n// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/\napp.UseHttpsRedirection();\n\n// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing\n// app.UseRouting();\n\n// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/\n// app.UseAuthentication();\n\n// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/introduction\n// app.UseAuthorization();\n\nif (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())\n{\n    app.MapOpenApi();\n}\n\nvar summaries = new[] { \"Freezing\", \"Bracing\", \"Chilly\", \"Cool\", \"Mild\", \"Warm\", \"Balmy\", \"Hot\", \"Sweltering\", \"Scorching\" };\n\napp.MapGet(\"/weatherforecast\", () =>\n        {\n            var forecast = Enumerable.Range(1, 5)\n                .Select(index => new WeatherForecast(DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddDays(index)), Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),\n                        summaries[Random.Shared.Next(summaries.Length)]\n                    )\n                )\n                .ToArray();\n            return forecast;\n        }\n    )\n    .WithName(\"GetWeatherForecast\");\n\n// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/middleware\n// app.UseEndpoints(_ => { });\n\napp.Run();\n\nrecord WeatherForecast(DateOnly Date, int TemperatureC, string?

This caused infinite recursion through circular references in properties like `SerializerOptions.Default.Default...`, leading to:\n\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Maximum validation depth of 32 exceeded at 'SerializerOptions.Default.Default.Default...' in 'JsonSerializerOptions'. This is likely caused by a circular reference in the object graph.\n```\n\n## Solution\n\nThe fix adds support for recognizing and skipping properties and parameters marked with `[JsonIgnore]` attributes during validation type discovery, similar to how `[FromServices]` attributes are already handled.\n\n**Key changes:**\n- Added `System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonIgnoreAttribute` to well-known types\n- Created `IsJsonIgnoredProperty` and `IsJsonIgnoredParameter` extension methods  \n- Updated `ExtractValidatableMembers` to skip properties/parameters with `[JsonIgnore]` attributes\n- Added comprehensive test coverage for the JsonIgnore functionality\n\n## Example\n\nWith this fix, the following endpoint will work correctly:\n\n```csharp\napp.MapPatch(\"/items/{id}\", (int id, JsonPatchDocument<Item> patchDoc) => \n{\n    // Validation will only process non-JsonIgnore properties\n    return Results.Ok();\n});\n```\n\nThe validation generator will now properly exclude properties marked with `[JsonIgnore]` from validation traversal, preventing circular reference exceptions while still validating all other properties with validation attributes.\n\nFixes #63047.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

This is a common issue during development, especially with Razor Pages projects using static web asset compression.\n\n•\tPreview versions are not as stable as official releases and may contain unresolved bugs, especially in new or experimental features like static web asset compression.\n•\tThe integration between Visual Studio, MSBuild, and the .NET SDK is still being refined in preview builds, which can lead to race conditions or file locks during parallel builds, hot reload, or background analysis.\n•\tFile locking issues are a known class of problems in .NET SDK previews and Visual Studio previews, especially when working with static assets and Razor Pages.\nWhat you can do:\n•\tRestart Visual Studio and ensure only one instance is running.\n•\tDelete the bin and obj folders before rebuilding.\n•\tCheck for background processes (like dotnet.exe, msbuild.exe, or antivirus) that may be locking files.\n•\tTry the same project in the latest stable Visual Studio and .NET SDK to see if the issue persists.\n•\tMonitor for updates: Preview builds are updated frequently, and such issues are often fixed in later previews or stable releases.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 6/11/2025, 09:08 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

You cannot navigate to other pages of the Blazor Web Server app.\n\nFirefox Version: 140.0.4 (64-bit)\n\n**I will try to attach** \n1.

A zipfile of the project\n\n**What I hope Microsoft will do**\n\nThis problem looks to me like a Firefox problem. But the question is, is there anything practical that Microsoft can do to accommodate how Firefox works. If so, I hope Microsoft will implement a solution. Regardless of whether Blazor Web Server can accommodate Firefox, if it is a Firefox problem, notify Firefox to give Firefox (Mozilla) the information they need to fix their browser.\n\n**Concluding Statement**\n\nI believe Blazor Web Server wants to run with all the popular browsers, including Firefox. And I believe Firefox wants to work with all the popular web applications and websites, including Blazor Web Server. I hope this submission will be helpful. Let me know if I might be able to provide any additional useful information about this.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 7/16/2025, 03:51 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

A previously specified `BindingInfo.BindingSource` is never overwritten.\r\n2. A complex type parameter, registered in the DI container, is assigned `BindingSource.Services`.\r\n3. A complex type parameter, not registered in the DI container, is assigned `BindingSource.Body`.\r\n4. Parameter with a name that appears as a route value in ANY route template is assigned `BindingSource.Path`.\r\n5. All other parameters are `BindingSource.Query`.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe believe the likelihood of breaking apps to be very low as it's not a common scenario to have a type in DI and as an argument in your API controller action at the same time. Also, this same behavior is currently supported by Minimal Actions.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you are broken by this change you can disable the feature by setting `DisableImplicitFromServicesParameters` to true.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nservices.Configure<ApiBehaviorOptions>(options => {\r\n     options.DisableImplicitFromServicesParameters = true;            \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, you could continue to have your action's parameters, with the new feature enabled or not, binding from your DI container using an attribute that implements `IFromServiceMetadata` (eg.: `FromServicesAttribute`).\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\nServices.AddScoped<SomeCustomType>();\r\n\r\n[Route(\"[controller]\")]\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class MyController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n     // Binding from the DI container\r\n    [HttpPost]\r\n    public ActionResult Post([FromServices]SomeCustomType service) => Ok();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAPI Controller actions.\r\n\r\n### Announcement\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/480","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40071","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Discussion] [Breaking change]: API Controllers Actions try to infer parameters from DI\" (#40071)"},{"Id":"1127423458","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-08T15:41:35","Actor":"Roy19","Number":"40069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sending byte array with SignalR NewtonsoftJsonProtocol","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nDuring SignalR streaming, I know that the stream data can be of various data types. Suppose I try to send some byte array using NewtonsoftJsonProtocol. I know that I should be encoding the data first into Base64 or some other format and then be sending the data but the channel writer does not prevent me from sending a byte array. If I send the data I should be receiving the data back in the correct format as well in the client. But it seems that is not the case. I get data back in a manner that seems to be absurd. The data seems to be repeating again, or be missing some values. This however is not the case when I convert it to a Base64 string and stream the data. With that said, how is data encoding being handled by the underlying SignalR protocols?\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nData should be sent and received correctly regardless of the underlying type.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a server to client downstream channel.

in a strange way","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nTo add events and formatters to the InputText component of Blazor, I have created an inherited component, InputText2.\r\nIt looks like in the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nThe Formatter parameter takes a Func that modifies the string in some way. In my example, I wanted postal codes in the format \"12345\" to be formatted \"123 45\". In FormatValueAsString, result gets the correct value, but this is not reflected in the UI after rendering. However, if I do set CurrentValueAsString to result, then it works. But I can't find any reason for this. And in other examples, that property is never touched either.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

The options `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` no longer exist, and some additional options now exist.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously to use the MessagePack hub protocol in the browser you needed to include 3 script references\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/msgpack5/msgpack5.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr-protocol-msgpack.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition the `msgpack5` package was downloaded to your `node_modules` so you could use it in your app if you wanted.\r\n\r\n`MessagePackOptions` had `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` properties, but doesn't anymore.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nTo use the MessagePack hub protocol in the browser you now only need 2 script references\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr-protocol-msgpack.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you will have the `@msgpack/msgpack` package downloaded to your `node_modules` if you want to use the directly in your app.\r\n\r\n`MessagePackOptions` has new properties and removed the `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` properties.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nReduced asset size, reduced complexity to consume the package, and more customizability.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you were previously using `msgpack5` in your app, you will need to add a direct reference to the library in your package.json.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nRemoved `MessagePackOptions.disableTimestampEncoding`\r\nRemoved `MessagePackOptions.forceFloat64`\r\n\r\n### Discussion issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30471\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/454","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Changed MessagePack library in @microsoft/signalr-protocol-msgpack javascript library\" (#454)"},{"Id":"814357042","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T11:05:37","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"453","RawContent":null,"Title":"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName","State":"open","Body":"## WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\r\n\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.WebEventDescriptor` class is part of Blazor's internal protocol for communicating events from JavaScript into .NET. This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`. This will not affect any typical application code as it is only a detail of the low-level platform implementation.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe property `EventArgsType` described a nonstandard, Blazor-specific category name for groups of DOM event types. For example, the `click` and `mousedown` events were both mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `mouse`. Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`. There is no longer a need to supply a Blazor-specific category name, so the old property `EventArgsType` is removed.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nIn PR [#29993](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/29993) we have introduced support for custom event arguments classes. As part of this, we no longer rely on all events fitting into a predefined set of categories. The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

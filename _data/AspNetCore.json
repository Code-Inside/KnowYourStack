Authentication Request), we need to use the `OnRedirectToIdentityProvider` event like:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddOpenIdConnect(options =>\r\n{\r\n   options.Events.OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = context =>\r\n   {\r\n       context.ProtocolMessage.AcrValues = \"tenant:abc\";\r\n       context.ProtocolMessage.UiLocales = \"en-us\"\r\n       return Task.CompletedTask;\r\n   };\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to add these two properties directly in `OpenIdConnectOptions`. \r\n\r\nThe mapping should be easy (here https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/OpenIdConnectHandler.cs#L382) as these two properties already exist in the OpenIdConnectMessage (https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect/OpenIdConnectMessage.cs)\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;\r\n\r\npublic class OpenIdConnectOptions : RemoteAuthenticationOptions\r\n{\r\n+    public string? AcrValues { get; set; }\r\n+    public string? UiLocales { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddOpenIdConnect(options =>\r\n{\r\n    options.AcrValues = \"tenant:abc\";\r\n    options.UiLocales = \"en-us\";\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nWe can maybe rely on the new `AdditionalAuthorizationParameters` proposed in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39243 to set these two parameters but should we reserve this property only for non standard OAuth/OpenID parameters?\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nNothing I can think of now.\r\n\r\ncc @Tratcher @martincostello ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39503","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow

code extension for reusable components","State":"open","Body":"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\nThe main purpose of extension code in C# is so we can add methods/operations to an object without adding the member to the class itself. \r\nIn Blazor however, in order to reuse a piece of UI code, you have to wrap it into a component or use an C# extension as below \r\n```C#\r\nRenderFragment GetButton(this ComponentBase caller, ButtonType buttonType, Theme buttonTheme)\r\n{\r\n    return (builder) =>\r\n    {\r\n\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method can then be called from any component as\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n@this.GetButton(ButtonType.Icon, Theme.Primary)\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent creation however can be costly in terms of performance as blazor has to manage and maintain the state of the components.\r\nHowever some components can be very basic in terms of functionalities, for example a Button Component simply wraps ``<button>`` and a couple of ifs.\r\nA grid cell component is just a ``td``\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWhat is proposed is that such basic component should be expressable as an extension method in .razor file or .cs file that returns RenderFragment and takes a number of parameter that would rather be decorated with ``[Parameter]`` in the component.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic static class ComponentExtension\r\n{\r\n    //user must supply all parameters except optional ones which are optional\r\n    //Extension component name must start with a Get and returns RenderFragment\r\n    //Can have parameters and even optional ones\r\n\t\r\n\t//this component can be used from any component\r\n    public static RenderFragment GetButton(this ComponentBase callerComponent, ButtonType buttonType, Theme buttonTheme, EventCallback click, int optionalParameter = 0)\r\n    {\r\n        return @<button @onclick=\"click\" class=\"@buttonType @buttonTheme\"></button>;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\t//this component can be used from any component\r\n    public static RenderFragment GetButton2(this ComponentBase callerComponent, ButtonType buttonType, Theme buttonTheme, EventCallback click, int optionalParameter = 0)\r\n    {\r\n        return (builder) => \r\n        {\r\n             builder.OpenElement(\"button\");\r\n             //more builders\r\n             builder.CloseElement();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\t\r\n\t//this component can be used only in CardComponent or super classes\r\n\tpublic static RenderFragment GetButton3(this CardComponent callerComponent, ButtonType buttonType, Theme buttonTheme, EventCallback click, int optionalParameter = 0)\r\n    {\r\n        return (builder) => \r\n        {\r\n             builder.OpenElement(\"button\");\r\n             //more builders\r\n             builder.CloseElement();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\t\r\n\t//this component can be used only in super classes of MyBaseComponent\r\n\tpublic static RenderFragment GetButton4<TComponent>(this CardComponent callerComponent, ButtonType buttonType, Theme buttonTheme, EventCallback click, int optionalParameter = 0) where TComponent : MyBaseComponent\r\n    {\r\n        return (builder) => \r\n        {\r\n             builder.OpenElement(\"button\");\r\n             //more builders\r\n             builder.CloseElement();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe razor generator will however allow this Component Extensions to be referenced like a normal component as\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<Button ButtonType=\"ButtonType.Icon\" ButtonTheme=\"Theme.Primary\" Click=\"DoSomething\"></Button>\r\n<Button2 ButtonType=\"ButtonType.Icon\" ButtonTheme=\"Theme.Primary\" Click=\"DoSomething\"></Button2>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand will generate a call to the extension method\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbuilder.AddContent(1, this.GetButton(ButtonTyp.Icon, Theme.Primary, EventCallback.Factory.Create(this, DoSomething)));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nThe advantage of this majorly is that the numbers of such component created will not have drawback on performance as it is simply a method call while user still get a feel of razor syntax instead of C# code in razor file.\r\n\r\nThis feature will not affect the Blazor Microsoft.AspNetCore.Component in any way, just the tooling support to call extension methods directly instead of buiilding the component with builder.OpenComponent\r\n\r\nIf this is a welcomed idea, I'd be willing to contribute this feature to the ``Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor.SourceGenerators``","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39494","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add support

Please describe.\r\n\r\nRoute parameters in an ASP.NET Core Web API can be marked as optional with a `?`, e.g.,\r\n```csharp\r\napp.MapGet(\"/test1/{foo?}\", (string? foo) => foo ?? \"none\"); // \"/test1\" returns \"none\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a route parameter marked as optional is followed by a non-optional route segment, the optional annotation is ignored.

This is only occurring when using Visual Studio 2022 and .Net6, and self-hosting.\r\n\r\nI created 2 extremely simple test apps, one in VS2019/.Net5 and the other in VS2022/.Net6 (both Enterprise). They are the same except for the versions. Have tried on 3 different PCs with similar results. The CPU for the browser as viewed in Task Manager begins an upward trend until it reaches 20% +. This can take 30 minutes or more. The .Net5 app generally remains < 1%.\r\n\r\nThis occurs even if no listeners are configured, though the upward trend is much faster if messages are being received.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt is expected that the browser CPU remains low, as it does when using .Net5.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nExample is at https://github.com/bryan-arn/_SignalRCpuDev\r\n\r\nFor the example, the solution creation overview is:\r\n1. Create new Blazor app - .Net6, no authentication, no HTTPS, Core Hosted\r\n2. Add Hub class and map endpoint in Program.cs - endpoints.MapHub<ServiceHub>(\"/serviceHub\");\r\n2. Add class to use as BackgroundService, add as hosted service in Program.cs - builder.Services.AddHostedService<SignalRCpuDevService>();\r\n3. Use BackgroundService to connect to hub and send current time every second (or however long specified in delay) as string to hub.\r\n4. In Index.cs, connect to hub, add receiver for 'receiveText' method and populate label.\r\n\r\nSo it is an extremely simple SignalR app.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

If that's the case you should use `app.Run` instead of `app.Use`.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 6.0-preview4\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await next();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await SomeAsyncWork();\r\n    // next never called\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await next(context);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that you can now pass `context` to the `next` delegate.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Run(async (context) =>\r\n{\r\n    await SomeAsyncWork();\r\n    // next never called\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `app.Run` when your middleware never calls `next`, otherwise you will get a compile error:\r\n`CS0121 The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'UseExtensions.Use(IApplicationBuilder, Func<HttpContext, Func, Task>)' and 'UseExtensions.Use(IApplicationBuilder, Func<HttpContext, RequestDelegate, Task>)'`\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe previous `Use` method would allocate 2 objects per request. The new overload avoids these allocations with a small change to how you invoke the next middleware.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you get a compile error, it means you are calling `app.Use` without using the `next` delegate.

This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`.

Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`.

If there are no https ports or multiple distinct ports then it's ambiguous which should be used so the middleware logs a warning and turns itself off. Http requests will be processed normally.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the HttpsRedirectionMiddleware isn't explicitly configured with a port it will search IServerAddressesFeature during the first request to figure out what https port it should redirect to.\r\n\r\nIf there are no https ports the middleware still logs a warning and turns itself off. Http requests will be processed normally. This supports development scenarios without https, as well as hosted scenarios where TLS is terminated before reaching the server.\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple distinct ports then it's ambiguous which should be used so the middleware throws an exception and fails the http request. \r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis is done to prevent potentially sensitive data from being served over un-encrypted http connections when https is known to be available.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nTo enable https redirection when the server has multiple distinct https ports you must specify one port in the configuration. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio#port-configuration.\r\n\r\nIf you do not need the HttpsRedirectionMiddleware in your app then remove UseHttpsRedirection from Startup.cs.\r\n\r\nIf you need to select the correct https port dynamically then please provide feedback on https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21291. \r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseHttpsRedirection ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.httpspolicybuilderextensions.usehttpsredirection?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/448","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpsRedirectionMiddleware will throw if there are multiple ambiguous https ports\" (#448)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1480963587308879875","CreatedAt":"2022-01-11T18:03:28+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

Also, opening circuits in MS Edge while waiting 60 seconds for a circuit in Firefox can be done without any issue.

Sorry for taking your time.\r\n\r\nI am using Blazor web Assmbly and .Net 6..200. When I have an object with a property in `DateTimeOffset` type (`student` in the example) and I get its value from a js function call through `InvokeAsync<T>` it show the result in GMT/UTC timezone and not in my local after calling js (both in browser and log) although the value is correct in the UTC. \r\nI try multiple way to propagate that property from JS and the only way that the time zone does not change from local to utc is to fill it with an string in `\"2022-02-28T01:18:06.932+08:30\"` format. I could not find any native method of datetime object in js to generate this string and the nearest thing to it is `toISOString()` which throw a serialization error. The following is my code in dotnet and js:\r\n**JS:**\r\n```\r\nclass Student {\r\n    constructor(student) {\r\n        this.name = student.name;\r\n        this.age = student.age;\r\n        this.isMarried = student.isMarried;\r\n        // this.created=new Date().toISOString();\r\n        // this.created=new Date(Date.now());\r\n        // this.created=new Date();\r\n        // this.created=student.created;\r\n        this.created=\"2022-02-28T01:18:06.932+08:30\";\r\n        return this;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport function getStudent(student) {    \r\n    return new Student(student);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**.Net**\r\n\r\n```\r\n@page \"/js-interop-component\"\r\n@inject IJSRuntime JS\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n    Name: @student?.Name\r\n    <br>\r\n    Age:@student?.Age\r\n    <br>\r\n    Married:@student?.IsMarried\r\n    <br>\r\n    Created At: @student?.Created\r\n</div>\r\n<button @onclick=\"getStudent\">JS Interop!</button>\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    private Student? student { get; set; }\r\n    private IJSObjectReference? module { get; set; }\r\n    private async Task getStudent(EventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        student = await module!.InvokeAsync<Student>(\"getStudent\", student);\r\n    }\r\n    protected override void OnInitialized()\r\n    {\r\n        student = new()\r\n        {\r\n            Name = \"Ali\",\r\n            Age = 22,\r\n            IsMarried = true,\r\n            Created = DateTime.Now,\r\n        };\r\n        base.OnInitialized();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)\r\n    {\r\n        if (firstRender)\r\n        {\r\n            module = await JS.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(\"import\", \"./Pages/JSInterop/JSInteropComponent.razor.js\");\r\n        }\r\n        await base.OnAfterRenderAsync(firstRender);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Student\r\n    {\r\n        public string?

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change. Optionally, there are changes to your application that you may consider to work around this change if it impacts your application:\r\n\r\n* [`ActivatorUtilitiesConstructorAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilitiesconstructorattribute) can be applied to constructor to specify an exact constructor to use.\r\n* Application developers may register an implementation of `IComponentActivator` in the DI container that reverts to the .NET 6 behavior.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nComponent constructors","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/482","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default\" (#482)"},{"Id":"1140446824","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-16T19:09:40","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"481","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient updated to 4.0.1","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWe have updated the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` package to 4.0.1.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0-preview2\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\nThe old version was `1.0.19249.1`\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWe now use `4.0.1`.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

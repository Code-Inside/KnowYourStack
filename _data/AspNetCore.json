Currently, Blazor developers must inject `IHostEnvironment` or `IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment` and write conditional logic manually—which is error-prone for components that run on both Server and WebAssembly.\n\n### Changes\n\n- **New `Environment` component** (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Environment`)\n  - `Include`: comma-separated environments to render in\n  - `Exclude`: comma-separated environments to suppress rendering (takes precedence)\n  - Case-insensitive matching, follows tag helper semantics\n\n- **WebAssembly support**\n  - Added `WebAssemblyHostEnvironmentAdapter` implementing `IHostEnvironment`\n  - Registered automatically in WebAssembly DI container\n  - Added `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions` reference\n\n- **Namespace conflict resolution**\n  - Updated existing `Environment.NewLine` usages to `System.Environment.NewLine` in affected files\n\n### Usage\n\n```razor\n<Environment Include=\"Development\">\n    <div class=\"alert\">Debug mode enabled</div>\n</Environment>\n\n<Environment Include=\"Development, Staging\">\n    <p>Pre-production environment</p>\n</Environment>\n\n<Environment Exclude=\"Production\">\n    <p>@DateTime.Now</p>\n</Environment>\n```\n\nFixes #60amamama\n\nFixes #60amamama → Fixes #34amamama\n\nFixes #34amamama → Let me check the actual issue number from the problem statement.\n\nFixes #34amamama is not correct. Looking at the issue, there's no specific issue number provided in the problem statement.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n\n<issue_title>Add a built-in Environment component</issue_title>\n<issue_description>MVC & Razor Pages have an environment tag helper for rendering content based on the current environment. In Blazor, you have to inject either the `IHostEnvironment` or `IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment` services and then write conditional rendering logic. This is tricky to do correctly for components that run on WebAssembly and are prerendered because you don't have a common way to get the environment that works for server and client. We have complicated explanations in the Blazor docs on how to handle this. We should consider just adding an Environment component, similar to the environment tag helper, that makes it easy to render content based on the current environment.</issue_description>\n\n<agent_instructions>Here's a sketch of the `Environment` component implementation:\n\n## Implementation\n\n```csharp\n// Licensed to the .NET Foundation under one or more agreements.\n// The .

Hosting.Abstractions` - available in both Server and WebAssembly hosting scenarios\n2.  **Follows `EnvironmentTagHelper` semantics** - `Include`/`Exclude` parameter names and behavior match the existing MVC tag helper.  Exclude takes precedence over Include.\n3. **Case-insensitive comparison** - matches the tag helper behavior\n4.  **Simplified API** - uses just `Include` instead...\n\n</details>\n\n- Fixes dotnet/aspnetcore#63689\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

When using `<base href=\"/subdir/\">`, a link like `<a href=\"#section1\">` navigates to `/subdir/#section1` instead of the current page's hash.\n\n**API Addition:**\n```csharp\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;\n\npublic static class NavigationManagerExtensions\n{\n    public static string GetUriWithHash(this NavigationManager navigationManager, string? hash);\n}\n```\n\n**Behavior:**\n- Appends hash to current URI, replacing any existing hash\n- Prepends `#` if not present in input\n- Removes hash when `null` or empty string passed\n- Preserves query string parameters\n\n**Usage:**\n```razor\n@inject NavigationManager Nav\n\n<a href=\"@Nav.GetUriWithHash(\"section1\")\">Go to section 1</a>\n```\n\nFixes #41amamamamamamamamama\n\nFixes #41amamamamamamamamama → Fixes #41amamamamama\n\nFixes #41amamamamamamamamama\n\nFixes #41773\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>[Blazor] Add `NavigationManager.GetUriWithHash()`</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>## Background and Motivation\r\n> \r\n> Relative hash URLs get resolved relative to the document's `baseURI`, just like other relative links. This is fine if the document's `baseURI` matches its location (as is the case when a `<base>` element is not used), but it makes things inconvenient when the `baseURI` and location don't match.\r\n> \r\n> For example, the following works when no `<base>` element exists, but doesn't work if the `<head>` were to contain something like `<base href=\"/subidr/\">`.\r\n> \r\n> ```razor\r\n> @page \"/home\"\r\n> \r\n> <a href=\"#section-1\">Go to section 1</a>\r\n> ...\r\n> <h1 id=\"section-1\">Section 1</h1>\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> A `NavigationManager.GetUriWithHash()` API could help mitigate this issue:\r\n> \r\n> ```razor\r\n> @page \"/home\"\r\n> @inject NavigationManager Nav\r\n> \r\n> <a href=\"@(Nav.GetUriWithHash(\"section-1\"))\">Go to section 1</a>\r\n> ...\r\n> <h1 id=\"section-1\">Section 1</h1>\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ## Proposed API\r\n> \r\n> ```diff\r\n> namespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;\r\n> \r\n> public static class NavigationManagerExtensions\r\n> {\r\n> +  public static string GetUriWithHash(this NavigationManager navigationManager, string? hash);\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ## Usage Examples\r\n> \r\n> ```razor\r\n> @page \"/home\"\r\n> @inject NavigationManager Nav\r\n> \r\n> <a href=\"@(Nav.GetUriWithHash(\"section-1\"))\">Go to section 1</a>\r\n> ...\r\n> <h1 id=\"section-1\">Section 1</h1>\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ## Alternative Designs\r\n> \r\n> None considered yet.\r\n> \r\n> ## Risks\r\n> \r\n> None.</issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> <comment_new><author>@</author><body>\n> Thanks for contacting us.\n> \n> We're moving this issue to the `.NET 9 Planning` milestone for future evaluation / consideration.

The service worker caches these responses with `redirected=true`, but browsers block returning redirected responses to navigation requests (which have `redirect: \"manual\"` mode) per [security policy](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=669363).\n\n**Changes:**\n- In `service-worker.published.js`, strip the `redirected` flag from cached responses by constructing a new `Response` object:\n\n```javascript\nif (cachedResponse && cachedResponse.redirected) {\n    const clonedResponse = cachedResponse.clone();\n    cachedResponse = new Response(clonedResponse.body, {\n        headers: clonedResponse.headers,\n        status: clonedResponse.status,\n        statusText: clonedResponse.statusText\n    });\n}\n```\n\n- Added test assertion to verify redirect handling code is present in published service worker\n\nFixes #33872\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n\n<issue_title>Blazor PWA breaks if hosted on Cloudflare Pages due to redirected index.html</issue_title>\n<issue_description>**Brief Description**\r\nAn attempt to host a Blazor PWA on [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) results in broken service-worker: the website won't load after the first visit, installed PWA will display an error on start. The root of the problem seems to be the redirect of `index.html`. The problem may not be specific only to Cloudflare Pages, but to any host that redirects requests to the index page.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n1. Create a .NET 5.0 Blazor WebAssembly Progressive Web Application from the standard project template: https://github.com/andreimilto/CloudflareBreaksBlazorPwa/tree/main/src.\r\n2. Publish to a folder (settings: release, net5.0, self-contained, browser-wasm, trim unused assemblies, delete all existing files prior to publish): https://github.com/andreimilto/CloudflareBreaksBlazorPwa/tree/main/deploy\r\n2. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages and open the website in a browser: https://cloudflarebreaksblazorpwa.pages.dev/\r\n4. On the first visit the website opens fine, web-app can be installed without any issues.\r\n5. Try to refresh the page in the browser (F5) or close and reopen the installed application - instead of the contents of the website the default browser's error page will be displayed.\r\n6. Browser console will have a warning:\r\n> The FetchEvent for \"https://cloudflarebreaksblazorpwa.pages.dev/\" resulted in a network error response: a redirected response was used for a request whose redirect mode is not \"follow\".\r\nPromise.then (async)\r\n(anonymous) @ service-worker.js:7\r\n\r\n**Cause of the problem**\r\nThe root of the problem seems to be the `index.html` redirect that happens when the service-worker attempts to fetch static resources for offline mode during its initialization phase:\r\n![cloudflarebreakesblazorpwa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61744578/123520145-fdc77a80-d6b7-11eb-815d-6d7176101b9f.png)\r\nAs a result `index.html` response gets saved in CacheStorage with `redirected=true`.\r\nWhen a user attempts to visit the website for the second time, the service-worker's `onFetch` returns cached redirected response of `index.hmtl`. This causes error because of the security policy of modern browsers:\r\n\r\n> To avoid the risk of open redirectors (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) introduce a new security restriction which disallows service workers from responding with a redirected response to requests with a redirect mode different from \"follow\". **This restriction also disallows to respond to navigation requests with redirected responses, because the redirect mode of navigation request is “manual”**.\r\n[[source](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=669363)]\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nAs a workaround the [code that removes the `redirected` flag from cached responses](https://github.com/andreimilto/CloudflareBreaksBlazorPwa/blob/319757c5b28a39e03b74bb70cf3fb7892765ecb5/src/CloudflareBreaksBlazorPwa/wwwroot/service-worker.published.js#L46-L52) may be added to the service worker:\r\n```js\r\nif (cachedResponse && cachedResponse.redirected) {\r\n    cachedResponse = new Response(cachedResponse.body,\r\n                                 {\r\n                                     headers: cachedResponse.headers,\r\n                                     status: cachedResponse.status,\r\n                                     statusText: cachedResponse.statusText\r\n                                 });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAlthough I'm not sure it's 100% correct approach to do that, it seems to be working: https://fix.cloudflarebreaksblazorpwa.pages.dev/\r\n\r\nMaybe something like this should be included in the Blazor PWA project template for .NET 6 to make it more robust and suitable for hosting on Cloudflare Pages out of the box.</issue_description>\n\n## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n\n<comments>\n<comment_new><author>@</author><body>\nWe've moved this issue to the Backlog milestone.

The comparison always failed, triggering unnecessary ETag regeneration.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Add `TruncateToSeconds` helper to strip sub-second components from `DateTimeOffset`\n- Apply truncation when comparing file timestamp against manifest value\n- Add unit tests for the truncation logic\n\n```csharp\n// Before: always triggers change detection due to precision mismatch\nif (fileInfo.LastModified != asset.GetLastModified())\n\n// After: proper comparison at second precision\nif (TruncateToSeconds(fileInfo.LastModified) != asset.GetLastModified())\n```\n\nFixes #61amamarking\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n\n<issue_title>ETag in ResponseHeader is different from staticwebassets.endpoints.json</issue_title>\n<issue_description>### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThis my program.cs files\n```\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.Services.AddControllersWithViews(options =>\n  options.Filters.Add());\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\napp.UseRouting();\n\napp.UseAuthentication();\napp.UseAuthorization();\n\n\napp.MapStaticAssets();\napp.MapControllerRoute(\n    name: \"default\",\n    pattern: \"{controller=Article}/{action=Index}/{id?}\")\n    .WithStaticAssets();\n\napp.Run();\n```\n\nThe problem is that for custom css and js file in wwwroot/css or wwwroot/js the ETag generated in staticwebassets.endpoints.json is not what returned for particular statis files in Response.Header ETag(Strong).\n\nand there each time the file is getting download with 200Ok  instead of 304 Not Modified Status\n\nWhat am I missing.\n\nstaticwebassets.endpoints.json (only the object representing site.css)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43d9c025-9693-44ae-8921-02364573c1c6)\n\nResponse Header\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8714193-9a04-46d6-bded-f91437f7c200)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_</issue_description>\n\n<agent_instructions>The fix is my last comment.</agent_instructions>\n\n## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n\n<comments>\n<comment_new><author>@javiercn</author><body>\n@CodAffection thanks for contacting us.\n\nDo you see this during build/development or also publish?</body></comment_new>\n<comment_new><author>@javiercn</author><body>\n@CodAffection thanks for the additional details.\n\nThe way this works is that its only enabled during development unless you explicitly enable it through config (most of our development features work that way).</body></comment_new>\n<comment_new><author>@javiercn</author><body>\n@CodAffection thanks for the additional details.\n\nYes, `IsBuildManifest` is set to false in the manifest that we generate during publish.\n\n> And also do we need all mechanisms in any particular environment\n\nYes and no, and I'll explain. `asp-append-version` precedes all the work that we did with fingerprinting. As far as I can remember, it's compatible with it (if assets are configured, then we will automatically use the fingerprinted version instead of appending to the query string).\n\nAppending to the query string is less desirable than changing the file path name, because any proxy server in the middle might choose to ignore the query string for caching/invalidation purposes (and there have been such cases in the past), while that can't be done for the path.\n\nAs for the ETag/Cache, it's complementary because we can't essentially fingerprint everything (for example, we don't rewrite CSS to add fingerprinted assets and there is no `importmap` mechanism like what it exists for JS, the day this exists, we would generate the same for other resources) so it is important that we setup `no-cache` and `ETag` for things that we can't fingerprint and we setup long cache times for immutable resources.\n\n</body></comment_new>\n<comment_new><author>@javiercn</author><body>\n@CodAffection thanks for the additional details.\n\nFor files that are on the razor templates (for example, things that are referenced with `~/` we are able to automatically switch to the fingerprinted names, but for resources inside that `.css` file we are not.

No custom event needed for input-based updates.\n\n2. **Custom event needed for blur**: Standard `@onchange` does NOT fire on blur for contenteditable elements (this is browser behavior), so a custom `@oncontentblur` event mapped to the browser's `blur` event is required to capture the final value when the user clicks away.\n\n3. **E2E test automation challenge**: Using Selenium's `SendKeys()` on contenteditable elements causes text to appear in reverse order because Blazor's re-rendering after each keystroke moves the caret position. The solution is to use JavaScript `ExecuteScript()` to set `textContent` directly and dispatch events.\n\n### Pending Steps\n\n- [ ] Documentation update for contenteditable binding usage\n- [ ] Consider adding `@bind` directive support (currently requires explicit `@oninput` handler)\n- [ ] Review whether `ContentEditableEventArgs` should be part of the framework or remain as a custom event pattern example\n\nFixes #9974","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64610","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add contenteditable binding support for Blazor\" (#64610)"},{"Id":"3687631886","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-02T21:37:15","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"64609","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support async validation in minimal APIs","State":"open","Body":"We should react to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/121536 one the APIs to support async validation are supported.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64609","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support async validation in minimal APIs\" (#64609)"},{"Id":"3687630293","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-02T21:36:49","Actor":"mikermnv","Number":"64608","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] PersistentState throws ArgumentException when using multiple instances of the same component","State":"open","Body":"# PersistentState throws ArgumentException with multiple component instances\n\n**Describe the issue**  \nWhen using `[PersistentState]` inside a reusable component that is rendered multiple times on the same page, Blazor throws the following exception rendering this page:\n\n````\nSystem.ArgumentException: There is already a persisted object under the same key at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Infrastructure.PersistentValueProviderComponentSubscription.PersistProperty() at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Infrastructure.ComponentStatePersistenceManager.<TryPauseAsync>g__TryExecuteCallback|21_0(Func1 callback, ILogger1 logger)\n````\n<img width=\"2797\" height=\"482\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2d887d3-efc3-4207-8ce3-e8978b452e7b\" />\n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Create a component with `[PersistentState]` property (Counter component).\n2. Render multiple instances of this component on the same page (on Home page place Counter component twice).\n3. Start web app.\n4. Observe the exception.\n\n**Expected behavior**  \nEach component instance should be able to persist its state independently, without key collisions. Alternatively, documentation should clarify how to generate unique keys per instance.\n\n**Sample code**\nCounter.razor\n```razor\n<PageTitle>Counter</PageTitle>\n@rendermode InteractiveServer\n\n<h1>Counter</h1>\n\n<p role=\"status\">Current count: @currentCount</p>\n\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" @onclick=\"IncrementCount\">Click me</button>\n\n@code {\n    [PersistentState] public int? currentCount { get; set; }\n\n    protected override void OnInitialized()\n    {\n        if (currentCount == null)\n        {\n            currentCount = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    private void IncrementCount()\n    {\n        currentCount = 10;\n    }\n}\n````\nHome.Razor\n````razor\n@page \"/\"\n\n<PageTitle>Home</PageTitle>\n\n<h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n\nWelcome to your new app.\n<Counter/>\n<Counter />\n````\nBlazor Server (Interective with prerendering)\n\n.NET version: 10.0\n\nBrowser: Edge\n\nOS: Windows 11 Pro\n\n**Additional notes**  \nFrom the documentation it appears that `[PersistentState]` works by serializing the property and then deserializing it later to restore the state. This mechanism works fine when there is only a single instance of the component. However, when multiple instances of the same component exist on the page, they all attempt to persist properties under identical names. As a result, the persistence manager encounters duplicate keys and throws an `ArgumentException`.\n\nThis raises an open question: in scenarios where multiple component instances share the same persisted property names, what is the recommended approach?

When returning to my tab (unopened and asleep for about 2.5 hours) the reconnect modal would disappear and return me to my page as normal, but it wouldn't blink as it re-renders the page or anything. What's more, clicking on any interactive elements would do nothing, as if the page was frozen. Depending on how my app was working at the moment, there would sometimes be no errors at all and I couldn't find any immediate programmatic indication it was in this state to address it. Using an interactive element (like buttons) in this state causes a silent \"There is no event handler associated with this event.\" error in the browser console.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI believe it should be behaving similar to #64228, either before or after the fix. It should error (perhaps even the same error), and then be addressed by default or by an action I can add to the handleReconnectStateChanged event in ReconnectModal. Since these both seem to have to do with lack of available circuit persistence info, they should both act similarly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nTo reproduce this issue use the templates available in visual studio 2026.\n\n1. Start a new project from the visual studio 2026 templates, use the Blazor Web App template. Specific settings I have: framework .NET 10, no authentication, render mode server, interactivity location global, include sample pages.\n2. Edit Program.cs to reduce the PersistedCircuitInMemoryRetentionPeriod to 10 seconds so we can test without waiting 2 hours. Also enables detailed errors:\n```\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server;\n\nbuilder.Services.Configure<CircuitOptions>(options =>\n{\n    options.DetailedErrors = true;\n    options.PersistedCircuitInMemoryRetentionPeriod = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); //from default 2 hours\n});\n```\n3. Run the app\n4. In the developer panel console run Blazor.pauseCircuit(). This disconnects and disposes of the circuit, leaving it persisted in memory.\n5. Wait 10 seconds, (what we put in program.cs). During these 10 seconds the circuit is persisted in server memory.\n6. Run Blazor.resumeCircuit(). This will not have any persisted circuit info since it has expired.\n7. Click on the navigation sidebar options and notice they do nothing. If you are already on the counter page, click the button and notice the error in the developer panel console.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8717a32-4e11-45b3-ba17-e03d814fdb87\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nReproducing while running in debug mode automatically breaks on the error occurring internally. Shows during UpdateRootComponents in CircuitHost.cs, giving an error \"object reference not set to an instance of an object\" because `RootComponentOperationBatch operationBatch` is null, and therefore can't run `RootComponentOperation[] operations = operationBatch.Operations;`.\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\nPausing and unpausing again while in the bugged state throws an error, but I haven't investigated that.\n\n### Workarounds thought of for developers in the meantime (both gross):\n\n1. JavaScript function that subscribes to the window error events and reloads the page when the user clicks something and gets the specific \"There is no event handler associated with this event.\" error message. This is a bad user experience in addition to being very hacky.\n2. Call a GetCircuitId .NET function from javascript that returns the current circuit id. In normal operation this will return a good value, but if the circuit is still starting up or is in the broken state it will return an empty string. Nice in that it isn't as bad of a user experience, but the race condition with the circuit starting up returning empty string just like the bugged state is not good.\n\n- Create CircuitHandler.cs to store CircuitId so it can be fetched (don't forget to register it as scoped service in program.cs)\n```\npublic class CircuitHandlerService : CircuitHandler\n{\n    public string CircuitId { get; private set; } = null!;\n\n    public CircuitHandlerService()\n    {\n        \n    }\n\n    public override Task OnCircuitOpenedAsync(Circuit circuit, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n    {\n        CircuitId = circuit.Id;\n        return base.OnCircuitOpenedAsync(circuit, cancellationToken);\n    }\n}\n```\n- Create CircuitValidator.cs as a helper to hold the JSInvokable function.\n```\npublic static class CircuitValidator\n{\n    public static event Func<string>? OnValidate;\n\n    [JSInvokable]\n    public static Task<string> GetServerCircuitId()\n    {\n        var id = OnValidate?.Invoke();\n        return Task.FromResult(id ?? \"\");\n    }\n}\n```\n- Modify MainLayout.razor to make the static function have access to the CircuitId (couldn't figure out the DI)\n```\n@implements IDisposable\n\n// ... everything in MainLayout.razor from the template ...\n\n@code {\n    protected override void OnInitialized()\n    {\n        CircuitValidator.OnValidate += HandleValidation;\n    }\n    private string HandleValidation()\n    {\n        return handler?.CircuitId ?? \"\";\n    }\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        CircuitValidator.OnValidate -= HandleValidation;\n    }\n}\n```\n- Modify ReconnectModal.razor.js to check for this circuit id on every reconnect and reload if it isn't available.\n```\nasync function handleReconnectStateChanged(event) {\n    if (event.detail.state === \"show\") {\n        reconnectModal.showModal();\n    } else if (event.detail.state === \"hide\") {\n        /* Waste time to beat the race condition of the circuit starting up on the server. May need more time than this depending on your app */\n        const circuitId2 = await DotNet.invokeMethodAsync('YOUR APP ASSEMBLY NAME', 'GetServerCircuitId');\n\n        reconnectModal.close();\n\n        const circuitId = await DotNet.invokeMethodAsync('YOUR APP ASSEMBLY NAME', 'GetServerCircuitId');\n        if (circuitId == '') {\n            console.log(circuitId);\n            location.reload();\n        }\n    } else if (event.detail.state === \"failed\") {\n        document.addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\", retryWhenDocumentBecomesVisible);\n    } else if (event.detail.state === \"rejected\") {\n        location.reload();\n    }\n}\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64607","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor Server App in

As I Type something in the editable div, I need to see the same reflected in the body, but it does not happen that way. The OnChange event does not fire automatically.\r\n> \r\n> ### Expected behavior\r\n> OnChange Event needs to fire and changes in editable div should be bound to the model.\r\n> \r\n> ### Screenshots\r\n> <img width=\"207\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-04 at 2 01 06 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49619395/57183069-90bc4f80-6e75-11e9-8ad7-5130480f2faa.png\">\r\n> <img width=\"380\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-04 at 2 02 50 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49619395/57183070-90bc4f80-6e75-11e9-86e8-ae4dd11038ff.png\">\r\n> </issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> <comment_new><author>@SteveSandersonMS</author><body>\n> We don't currently support `bind` with `contenteditable`.

Please describe the problem.\n\n[This page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-10.0?view=aspnetcore-10.0#set-the-environment-in-standalone-blazor-webassembly-apps) documents the change that discontinues use of `launchSettings.json` to set the environment variable for standalone Blazor WebAssembly apps.  The reasons for this change are not clear.  I suggest that this change negates two important features of `launchSettings.json`:\n\n1.) A developer can easily change environments without making a change to a source-controlled file.  This means that there is no worry of the change being inadvertently checked in.\n\n2.)  `launchSettings.json` works well and works consistently with the rest of the .net ecosystem. \n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nDoes the use of `launchSettings.json` exclude the changes made in .net 10? If not, I suggest that the pre-.net 10 functionality be restored to allow the continued use of `launchSettings.json`.  If a developer wishes to also use `WasmApplicationEnvironmentName` also than perhaps that setting can supersede `launchSettings.json`.  \n\n\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nReference:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59456","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64598","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The Properties/launchSettings.json file is no longer used to control the environment in standalone Blazor WebAssembly apps.\" (#64598)"},{"Id":"3686516302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-02T16:06:04","Actor":"michaelwildvarian","Number":"64597","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core Data Protection has cryptographic errors on Ubuntu 22.04 with FIPS enabled","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nASP.NET Core applications that use the Data Protection APIs (e.g. by using the session middleware), fail with cryptographic operation errors on Ubuntu 22.04 if FIPS mode is enabled. The same code works fine with .NET 8.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe application should work and not produce cryptographic operation errors.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n### Preparation\n \n* Install VM with Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS. Minimal install is sufficient. Link to installer ISO: https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso\n* Update the system: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`\n* Add the .NET backports PPA: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dotnet/backports`\n* Install .NET 10 SDK: `sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-10.0`\n* Create a minimal webapi project:\n    ```sh\n    mkdir DotnetFipsIssue\n    cd DotnetFipsIssue\n    dotnet new webapi\n    ```\n* Modify `Program.cs` as follows:\n    ```csharp\n    // Right after: var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n    builder.Services\n      .AddDistributedMemoryCache()\n      .AddSession();\n\n    // SNIP ... SNAP\n\n    // Right after: var app = builder.Build();\n    app.UseSession();\n    ```\n\n### Test without FIPS enabled\n\n* Start the application: `dotnet run --launch-profile https`\n* From another terminal, call: `curl -k https://localhost:5000/weatherforecast`\n  (replace with the correct port as displayed by the `dotnet run` command)\n* Observe that the `curl` command displays the weather forecast as expected and\n  the application runs without errors.\n\n### Test with FIPS enabled\n\n* Now attach the VM to Ubuntu Pro and enable FIPS mode:\n    ```sh\n    sudo pro attach --no-auto-enable\n    sudo pro enable fips-updates\n    ```\n* Once completed successfully, reboot the VM: `sudo reboot`\n* After the reboot, verify that FIPS mode is enabled:\n    ```sh\n    cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled\n    ```\n  It should return `1`.\n* Start the application again:\n    ```sh\n    cd DotnetFipsIssue\n    dotnet run --launch-profile https\n    ```\n* Observe that the application displays a lot of warnings related to cryptographic operations, starting with:\n    ```\n    warn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.KeyManagement.DefaultKeyResolver[12]\n          Key {75b3f7e0-199b-439b-a57c-22ca16d0ea3e} is ineligible to be the default key because its CreateEncryptor method failed after the maximum number of retries.\n          System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred.

While `IComponentActivator` exists for customizing component instantiation, there is no equivalent mechanism for property injection.\n\nThis creates a gap for advanced scenarios such as:\n- **Blazor Hybrid with .NET MAUI**: Additional platform-specific context may be needed for property resolution\n- **Custom DI containers**: May need to intercept property injection for custom behavior\n- **Testing scenarios**: Easier mocking and verification of property injection\n\nWe cannot extend `IComponentActivator` to handle property injection as that would be a breaking change for existing custom implementations. Following the pattern established by MVC (which defines separate activators for tag helpers, view components, controllers, and Razor Pages), we propose introducing a separate `IComponentPropertyActivator` interface specifically for property activation.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;\n\n+ /// <summary>\n+ /// Provides a mechanism for activating properties on Blazor component instances.\n+ /// </summary>\n+ public interface IComponentPropertyActivator\n+ {\n+     /// <summary>\n+     /// Gets a delegate that activates properties on a component of the specified type.\n+     /// </summary>\n+     /// <param name=\"componentType\">The type of component to create an activator for.</param>\n+     /// <returns>\n+     /// A delegate that takes an IServiceProvider and an IComponent\n+     /// instance, and populates the component's injectable properties.\n+     /// </returns>\n+     Action<IServiceProvider, IComponent> GetActivator(\n+         [DynamicallyAccessedMembers(Component)] Type componentType);\n+ }\n```\n\n**From `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt`:**\n```\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Components.IComponentPropertyActivator\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Components.IComponentPropertyActivator.GetActivator(System.Type! componentType) -> System.Action<System.IServiceProvider!, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.IComponent!>!\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n**Custom Implementation:**\n```csharp\npublic class CustomPropertyActivator : IComponentPropertyActivator\n{\n    public Action<IServiceProvider, IComponent> GetActivator(Type componentType)\n    {\n        // Custom property injection logic with caching\n        return (serviceProvider, component) =>\n        {\n            // Inject properties with custom behavior\n            // e.g., logging, platform-specific resolution, etc.\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Registration:**\n```csharp\n// In Startup.cs or Program.cs\nservices.AddSingleton<IComponentPropertyActivator, CustomPropertyActivator>();\n```\n\n**Default Behavior (for reference - this is internal):**\n\nThe framework provides `DefaultComponentPropertyActivator` internally which:\n- Discovers properties marked with `[Inject]`\n- Supports keyed services via `[Inject(Key = \"...\")]`\n- Caches activator delegates per component type\n- Integrates with Hot Reload for cache invalidation\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n1. **Extend `IComponentActivator`**: We considered adding property injection responsibility to the existing `IComponentActivator` interface. However, this would be a breaking change for existing custom implementations that don't expect to handle property injection.\n\n2. **Context object parameter**: The original issue mentioned considering a context object for future-proofing. We opted for the simpler `IServiceProvider` parameter to match the existing Blazor patterns (consistent with `IComponentActivator`) and avoid unnecessary complexity. If additional context is needed in the future, a new overload or interface version can be introduced.\n\n3. **MVC's context-based pattern**: MVC activators like `ITagHelperActivator` use context objects (e.g., `ViewContext`). We chose the direct `IServiceProvider` approach to maintain consistency with existing Blazor APIs and because Blazor's rendering context is already available through other means.\n\n## Risks\n\n1. **Interface extensibility**: The interface has a single method. If we need to add more methods in the future, we would need to add default implementations or introduce a new interface version to avoid breaking changes.\n\n2. **Performance considerations**: Custom implementations should cache activator delegates (as the default implementation does) to avoid repeated reflection costs. Poor implementations could cause performance regressions.\n\n3. **No breaking changes identified**: This is a purely additive change. The default behavior remains unchanged for applications that don't register a custom `IComponentPropertyActivator`.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation:** #64595\n**Related Issue:** #63451","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64596","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API Proposal] IComponentPropertyActivator for Blazor property injection\" (#64596)"},{"Id":"3686294958","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-02T15:33:08","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"64594","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Infrastructure] Fix TypeScript build error for npm package update","State":"closed","Body":"# [Infrastructure] Fix TypeScript build error for npm package update\n\n- [x] You've read the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).\n- [ ] You've included unit or integration tests for your change, where applicable.\n- [ ] You've included inline docs for your change, where applicable.\n- [ ] There's an open issue for the PR that you are making.

apps compute their `<base>` URI when hosted under subpaths.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nApps mounted at `/dashboard` rely on manually editing `<base href>` or injecting JavaScript to keep casing in sync, which was brittle and inconsistent across Server, Auto, and standalone WebAssembly hosts. `BasePath` standardizes this by:\r\n- Automatically mirroring `HttpContext.Request.PathBase` casing for Blazor Web / hybrid scenarios.\r\n- Providing `Href` and `FallbackHref` parameters for environments (like static WASM hosting) where `PathBase` isn’t available.\r\n- Normalizing URLs (trailing slash, absolute URI handling) to avoid resource lookup failures in deeper folder structures.\r\n\r\nThis gives developers a first-class, framework-supported answer instead of per-app workarounds mentioned

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For more information, visit https://aka.ms/aspnet/deprecate/004.\n\nUsing `IWebHost` or `WebHost` will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID **ASPDEPR008**:\n> warning ASPDEPR008: WebHost is obsolete. Use HostBuilder or WebApplicationBuilder instead.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

This will allow types that implement custom binding logic via `TryParse` or `BindAsync`, and `IResult` types, to add metadata that describes the API parameters and responses in Swagger UI and OpenAPI documents.\r\n\r\nThis, along with some other capabilities, will better allow route handler delegates to self-describe themselves from just the type information in their signature, reducing the need for the developer to manually provide the same type information about the API in the endpoint metadata.\r\n\r\nA functionally equivalent version of this feature is already implemented in the [MinimalApis.Extensions library](https://github.com/DamianEdwards/MinimalApis.Extensions).\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nToday, route handler delegates in Minimal APIs are auto-described in `ApiExplorer` and thus Swagger UI and OpenAPI documents (through libraries like Swashbuckle) including details of the parameters they accept and response they return, e.g.\r\n\r\n**Program.cs**\r\n``` c#\r\nvar todos = new Dictionary<int, Todo>\r\n{\r\n    { 1, new Todo(1, \"Buy the groceries\") },\r\n    { 2, new Todo(2, \"Wash the car\") },\r\n    { 3, new Todo(3, \"Put out the garbage\") }\r\n};\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/todos/{id}\", (int id) => todos[id]);\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n\r\nrecord Todo(int Id, string Title, bool IsCompleted = false);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Swagger UI**\r\n<img width=\"378\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/249088/157735876-7072a3e7-ba2e-4f94-9256-ee3bb1bfb0f0.png\">\r\n\r\nNote that the input parameter `id` is correctly named and typed based on the delegate parameter, and the 200 response has a media type of *application/json* and a body schema based on the `Todo` type that the delegate returns.\r\n\r\nThis auto-describing of the API breaks down though when the extensibility options for parameter binding or result processing are utilized, namely `TryParse` or `BindAsync` on parameter types, and `IResult` for return types. e.g.:\r\n\r\n**Program.cs**\r\n``` c#\r\napp.MapGet(\"/todos/customid/{id}\", (TodoId id) =>\r\n    todos.SingleOrDefault(t => t.Key == id.Id).Value switch\r\n    {\r\n        Todo todo => Results.Ok(todo),\r\n        _ => Results.NotFound()\r\n    });\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n\r\nrecord Todo(int Id, string Title, bool IsCompleted = false);\r\nrecord struct TodoId(int Id)\r\n{\r\n    public static bool TryParse(string value, out TodoId result)\r\n    {\r\n        if (int.TryParse(value, out int id))\r\n        {\r\n            result = new TodoId(id);\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        result = new();\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Swagger UI**\r\n<img width=\"365\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/249088/157741702-90e081ca-36e2-4dce-8ca9-7c4132723d1f.png\">\r\n\r\nNote this time that the `id` parameter is typed as \"string\" and the 200 response has no media type or schema information.\r\n\r\nTo restore the API description details, the user is required to manually describe the API via extension methods (or attributes) that add endpoint metadata about the responses, e.g.:\r\n\r\n**Program.cs**\r\n``` c#\r\napp.MapGet(\"/todos/customid/{id}\", (TodoId id) =>\r\n    todos.SingleOrDefault(t => t.Key == id.Id).Value switch\r\n    {\r\n        Todo todo => Results.Ok(todo),\r\n        _ => Results.NotFound()\r\n    })\r\n    .Produces<Todo>()\r\n    .Produces(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound);\r\n```\r\n**Swagger UI**\r\n<img width=\"321\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/249088/157742096-7b0e7c8b-8a12-40cc-9b52-ecbb1d9aa88b.png\">\r\n\r\nNote that today there is no endpoint metadata supported that will describe API parameters, so the `id` parameter is still typed incorrectly as string, but the 200 and 404 responses are now described.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Solution\r\nWe should introduce a way for types used in the signature of route handlers (parameters and return values) to add metadata to the associated endpoint. This metadata should be featured enough to properly contribute all API parameter and response details in `ApiExplorer` and thus Swagger UI and OpenAPI documents.\r\n\r\n## Interfaces\r\nTwo new interfaces will be introduced, one for parameter types and another for return value types. The presence of these interfaces on a type indicates they can contribute to the endpoint metadata.\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// Marker interface that indicates a type provides a static method that returns <see cref=\"Endpoint\"/> metadata for a\r\n/// parameter on a route handler delegate.\r\n/// </summary>\r\npublic interface IProvideEndpointParameterMetadata\r\n{\r\n    static abstract IEnumerable<object> GetMetadata(ParameterInfo parameter, IServiceProvider services);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// Marker interface that indicates a type provides a static method that returns <see cref=\"Endpoint\"/> metadata for the\r\n/// returned value from a given <see cref=\"Endpoint\"/> route handler delegate.\r\n/// </summary>\r\npublic interface IProvideEndpointResponseMetadata\r\n{\r\n    static abstract IEnumerable<object> GetMetadata(Endpoint endpoint, IServiceProvider services);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach interface has a single method that will be called by the framework when the endpoint is being built, with the returned objects being added to the endpoint metadata.\r\n\r\nThe `IProvideEndpointParameterMetadata` interface's `GetMetadata` method accepts a `ParameterInfo` representing the relevant route handler delegate parameter, such that the parameter name, type details, etc. are available, along with the `IServiceProvider` for the application's DI container.\r\n\r\nThe `IProvideEndpointResponseMetadata` interface's `GetMetadata` method accepts the `Endpoint` instance that the returned metadata will be applied to, such that the endpoint name and other metadata are available, along with the `IServiceProvider` for the application's DI container.\r\n\r\n> ❓ Is the `Endpoint` instance actually available at the time this method would be called and if not what other type could be passed here instead to achieve the same purpose? In `MinimalApis.Extensions` this method is called from the custom `IApiDescriptionProvider` when iterating the `Endpoint` instances from the `EndpointDataSource` ([see here](https://github.com/DamianEdwards/MinimalApis.Extensions/blob/main/src/MinimalApis.Extensions/Metadata/EndpointProvidesMetadataApiDescriptionProvider.cs#L88)).\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n### Existing result types\r\nThe existing `IResult` implementations in the framework are currently internal, although that will likely change as part of #37502. For this feature to be useful out-of-the-box, these result types must be public and be updated (where applicable) to implement `IProvideEndpointResponseMetadata` so that they can contribute to endpoint metadata.\r\n\r\nResult types that represent a response with a body that's based on a type need to be able to convey the schema of the body in their type signature, meaning they should need to be generic, where the generic type argument is the type that represents the resource being returned, e.g. `OkResult<Todo>`, `CreatedAtResult<Todo>`, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso each type needs to completely represent a distinct HTTP result without relying on runtime/instance data, e.g. `StatusCodeResult` is ambiguous when statically observed as to what the actual HTTP result is and thus will not work, whereas a `NotFoundResult` can wholly represents an HTTP 404 Not Found result statically.\r\n\r\n## `Results` class static factory methods\r\nThe current `Results` static factory methods that all return `IResult` do not allow the framework to observe the actual concrete types being returned, and thus we'll need to consider adding new methods to create the result types that preserve the concrete type information, or some other solution, e.g.\r\n- Introduce a new static class, e.g. `HttpResults`, which has factory methods for the public result types that return the concrete types\r\n- Introduce a new set of methods on the existing `Results` class but under a new property, e.g. `Results.Typed.NotFound()` or `Results.SelfDescribing.NotFound()`, etc.\r\n- Change the existing static methods to return the now public concrete types instead of `IResult` (Note along with this being a binary-breaking change, this has implications on the compiler's ability to infer the return type of anonymous lambdas when there's more than one return type in the method so is likely a source-breaking change too)\r\n- Add overloads to the existing static methods that differ only by return type. This is not possible in C# but can be expressed in MSIL. Then have the .NET 7 ref assemblies only expose the new concrete-type returning overloads while the implementation assembly has both overloads, keeping existing binaries bound to the .NET 6 `IResult`-returning overloads (this is likely crazy but possibly crazy like a fox, so...). (Note this has the same issue as the point above RE the compiler's ability to infer anonymous lambda return type)\r\n- Make the in-box result types constructable so that they can be returned directly, e.g. `return new NotFoundResult();`\r\n- Add static factory methods to the in-box result types so they can be returned directly, e.g. `return NotFoundResult.Create();`\r\n- Something else?\r\n\r\n## Multiple return types\r\nMost APIs end up having multiple return paths that return different result types depending on the outcome of the API invocation, e.g. returning an `OkResult` if the resource is found, and a `NotFoundResult` if it isn't. C# doesn't currently have a language construct that allows a method to declare it returns multiple types (see discriminated unions at dotnet/csharplang#113) but this **can** be achieved using the type system thanks to generics, e.g.\r\n\r\n**[TodosApi.cs](https://github.com/DamianEdwards/MinimalApis.Extensions/blob/main/samples/TodosApi.Dapper/TodosApi.cs)**\r\n``` c#\r\napp.MapGet(\"/todos/{id}\", GetTodoById);\r\n\r\nasync Task<Results<Ok<Todo>, NotFound>> GetTodoById(int id, IDbConnection db) =>\r\n    await db.QuerySingleOrDefaultAsync<Todo>(\"SELECT * FROM Todos WHERE Id = @id\", new { id })\r\n    is Todo todo\r\n        ? Results.Extensions.Ok(todo)\r\n        : Results.Extensions.NotFound();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TODO** Point to issue discussing supporting union `IResult` return types","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40646","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow parameter and return types of route handler delegates (Minimal APIs) to contribute to endpoint metadata\" (#40646)"},{"Id":"1165625958","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-10T20:38:13","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"40644","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 2.1.33 and merge internal commits","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/40644","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 2.1.33 and merge internal commits\" (#40644)"},{"Id":"1165679491","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-10T20:20:15","Actor":"voroninp","Number":"40645","RawContent":null,"Title":"Clarification on AuthenticateResult.NoResult vs AuthenticateResult.Failure. 2nd iteration.","State":"open","Body":"I am confused by the explanation given [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/38685)\r\n\r\nI also asked the question at [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/71423716/921054)\r\n\r\nFrom @blowdart 's response it follows that there can be a set of authentication handlers.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

This experience is going to focus on decoupling the frontend from the backend into two separate projects. For details here.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

Optionally, captured the new returned `IDisposable` and dispose it if you later wish to undo the effects of the call.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.AddDataAnnotationsValidation(EditContext)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.forms.editcontextdataannotationsextensions.adddataannotationsvalidation?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/458","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation\" (#458)"},{"Id":"848690041","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T18:24:35","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"457","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Java Client updated to RxJava3","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis issue template is for use in opening issues that document breaking changes.

I'm not sure which other types of object are also affected.\r\n\r\nThis only seems to affect production builds - development builds seem to behave correctly.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nJavaScript interop functions should return the correct expected values regardless of whether the build is production or development.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nThis has been tested in Chrome and Firefox in Windows 11 - both with the same results.\r\n\r\n**This requires Docker to be installed** so that we can run a production build (as opposed to a development build which doesn't seem to be affected by this issue). There might be some way to run in production without the need to build like this that I'm not aware of.\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/mooski/blazor-js-test\r\n\r\n    _This is just the 'Blazor WebAssembly App Empty' project template with small changes to the following files: `Client/Pages/Index.razor`; `Client/wwwroot/index.html`; `Dockerfile`; `nginx.conf`._\r\n    \r\n2. Open a terminal in the root folder and run this command:\r\n\r\n    `docker build -t blazor-js-test .`\r\n    \r\n3. Assuming the project builds successfully, run this command:\r\n\r\n    `docker run -p 8080:80 blazor-js-test`\r\n    \r\n4. Visit http://localhost:8080/ in a browser.\r\n\r\n5. Open developer tools.\r\n\r\n6. Click the 'Print window width to console' button.\r\n\r\n7. Note that there's a discrepancy in the values printed in the console. The correct window width is printed from the JavaScript code, but the value printed from the Blazor code is always zero.\r\n\r\nTo see the application behaving how we'd expect instead, we can use this workaround:\r\n\r\n1. Uncomment line 22 in `Client/Pages/Index.razor`.\r\n\r\n2. Build and run the Docker image again.\r\n\r\n3. Back in the browser, refresh the page and click the 'Print window width to console' button again.\r\n\r\n4. Note that the correct values are now printed in the console (and this is despite the fact that the uncommented code doesn't even get touched).\r\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n7.0.202\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47468","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blazor - JavaScript interop returns the wrong values for some types in production builds\" (#47468)"},{"Id":"1646713278","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-30T00:10:54","Actor":"adityamandaleeka","Number":"47489","RawContent":null,"Title":"Treat 'Content-Range's with last-byte-pos equal to length as invalid","State":"open","Body":"Fix https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44166\r\n\r\nPer [RFC 7233](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7233.html#header.content-range):\r\n\r\n> A Content-Range field value is invalid if it contains a [byte-range-resp](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7233.html#header.content-range) that has a [last-byte-pos](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7233.html#rule.ranges-specifier) value less than its [first-byte-pos](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7233.html#rule.ranges-specifier) value, or a [complete-length](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7233.html#header.content-range) value less than or equal to its [last-byte-pos](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7233.html#rule.ranges-specifier) value.\r\n\r\nAlso removed duplication of the invalid string data while I was touching the tests.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47489","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Treat 'Content-Range's with last-byte-pos equal to length as invalid\" (#47489)"},{"Id":"1646668696","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T23:18:46","Actor":"eerhardt","Number":"47488","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build errors coming from RequestDelegateGenerator generated code instead of my code","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nUsing the RequestDelegateGenerator in an app that is missing using statements appears to be hiding the real build errors in my code and masking them with build errors from the generated code.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect to get a build error in my own code because I am missing the commented out `using` at the top of the C# file.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n`dotnet build` the following app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n//using System.Security.Claims;\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddJwtBearer();\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthorization();\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello, World!\");\r\napp.MapGet(\"/secret\", (ClaimsPrincipal user) => $\"Hello {user.Identity?.Name}.

This could allow us to invoke JS without the overhead of having a full component.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\ninterface IElementExtension\r\n{\r\n    Task Extend(ElementReference reference);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementations would be decorated with an attribute,  `ElementExtensionInvokeAttribute` in the examples below for lack of a better name, which would tell the renderer when to call the extension class, for example once after it has initialized or after each render. The extension could be added onto the element using `@@`, followed by the class name.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\nFor example, suppose our razor page contains the following:\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n    <input type=\"text\" @@AlwaysFocus />\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"scrollable\" @@Scrollable>\r\n        <a>Item 1</a>\r\n        <a>Item 2</a>\r\n        <a>...</a>\r\n        <a>Item N</a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example extension would be:\r\n```cs\r\n[ElementExtensionInvoke(InvokeKind.OnAfterRender)]\r\npublic class AlwaysFocus : IElementExtension\r\n{\r\n    public async Task Extend(ElementReference reference)\r\n    {\r\n        await reference.FocusAsync();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis class will be called after each time the parent component is rendered, and will call the web application to focus the input field.\r\n\r\nAnother extension would be:\r\n```cs\r\n[ElementExtensionInvoke(InvokeKind.OnInitialized)]\r\npublic class Scrollable : IElementExtension\r\n{\r\n    private readonly IJSRuntime _js;\r\n\r\n    public Scrollable(IJSRuntime js)\r\n    {\r\n        _js = js;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public async Task Extend(ElementReference reference)\r\n    {\r\n        await js.InvokeVoidAsync(\"MakeScrollableWithMouse\", reference);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would invoke a method using the JS Runtime, and would only be called once when the parent is initialized.\r\n\r\n# Benefits\r\nBlazor Components have overhead and sometimes we find ourselves doing the same thing a few times on difference components. This extension method would allow us to follow the DRY principle.\r\n\r\n# Downsides\r\nMy proposal does not allow changing the rendering on the element itself. I do not know how this could be implemented, but I believe a blazor component is better suited for this.\r\n\r\n# Real-life example\r\nOur Blazor application is used on touch screen monitors. Some of these are _really_ old and use mouse events, which means when the LeftButton is pressed and there is a mouse move event, the user might want to scroll a list. We have these in a few places and, for right or wrong, a component was not used. We use ElementReference in our code-behind and then invoke a JS method passing the reference in. A lot of this code is similar with slight variations, on different components. Extension method would simplify the code, without having to create a whole new component.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47466","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Please consider Extensions to Blazor WASM elements?\" (#47466)"},{"Id":"1644317277","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T15:00:25","Actor":"arianmotamedi","Number":"47470","RawContent":null,"Title":"[ASPNET Core 2.1] src\\SignalR\\clients\\csharp\\Http.Connections.Client\\src\\HttpConnection.cs should null check logging scope before disposing","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n[HttpConnection.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/release/2.1/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Http.Connections.Client/src/HttpConnection.cs) in SignalR client (aspnet core 2.1) is disposing its ILogger.Scope object [without doing a null check](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/release/2.1/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Http.Connections.Client/src/HttpConnection.cs#L277).

For whatever reason, the scope isn't null in `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` 2.2 even though the docs say this version [could still return null](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loggerextensions.beginscope?view=dotnet-plat-ext-2.2#returns).

Activity scopes are already null-checked before being disposed in other places - e.g. [aspnetcore/HostingApplicationDiagnostics.cs at release/2.1 · dotnet/aspnetcore · GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/release/2.1/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/Internal/HostingApplicationDiagnostics.cs#L156).\r\n\r\nThis PR additionally fixes a set of flaky tests in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DeveloperCertificates.XPlat.Tests` group caused by existence of multiple test certs in the store, which the cleanup method isn't correctly deleting at startup. That change is in `CertificateManager.cs`.\r\n\r\nFixes (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47470)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47471","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Null check nullable Scope before disposing in SignalR HttpConnection.cs\" (#47471)"},{"Id":"1645779730","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T13:08:22","Actor":"bitsystem79","Number":"47483","RawContent":null,"Title":"WEB API 6.0 -

The problem stems from the fact that the cache key that cache storage relies on is a side effect of looking up the cache. This change simply makes it so that the cache key is created even if just ```AllowCacheStorage``` is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis is a useful scenario because someone might want to implement a cache refresh mechanism which forces to repopulation of the cache without attempting to first fetch what might be considered stale data.

The actual real-world story of adding auth with all the extras is where I don't think I should have to write so much code and it should be easy for identity vendors to expose what's needed to identity consumers, such as Swagger, that we don't need to glue them together.\r\n\r\nHere's what I need to glue Okta and Swagger together:\r\n```\r\ninternal static class OktaExtensions\r\n{\r\n    internal

`OpenApiSecurityRequirement` or make it a simple option to ask it to provide them. And then Swagger would automatically know where to find them.\r\n\r\nSimilarly on the client side, there is no standard way to take an `IHttpClientBuilder` and add an OAuth bearer token to its calls from such-and-such a vendor's identity server according to some configuration. I wrote much more code than I can snip here to create a standard way for our shop. I'd open source it if my company allowed, but this should already be part of Microsoft.Extensions anyway.

Using it can cause thread exhaustion and server throughput problems.\r\n\r\n`HttpRequest.Form` is confusing to people as similar APIs such `HttpRequest.QueryString`, `HttpRequest.Cookies`, `HttpRequest.Headers`, etc, are safe to use.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Analyzer\r\n\r\n### Analyzer Behavior and Message\r\n\r\nUsing `HttpRequest.Form` should generate a warning. There are some cases where it is safe to use, so we need to figure out how broad to make the warning.\r\n\r\nOne option could be:\r\n* API used inside an async method = warning\r\n* API used inside a sync method = info\r\n\r\nSee discussion at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44390#issuecomment-1269279517 for more info.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAnalyzer categories are derived from the categories documented in https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/categories\r\nTo select a category, review each category's description and select the best category based on the functionality of your analyzer.\r\n\r\nAnalyzer severity levels are documented in https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers#configure-severity-levels\r\nReview the description to observe how the level set on the analyzer will affect build-time and editor behavior and select the best\r\nlevel for the task.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\n- [ ] Design\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ] Globalization\r\n- [ ] Interoperability\r\n- [ ] Maintainability\r\n- [ ] Naming\r\n- [x] Performance\r\n- [ ] Reliability\r\n- [ ] Security\r\n- [ ] Style\r\n- [ ] Usage\r\n\r\n### Severity Level\r\n\r\n- [ ] Error\r\n- [x] Warning (async method?)\r\n- [x] Info (sync method?)\r\n- [ ] Hidden\r\n\r\n## Usage Scenarios\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic Task<Result> SaveProduct()\r\n{\r\n    var productName = Request.Form[\"product_name\"]; // WARNING HERE\r\n    _repository.Add(new Product { Name = productName });\r\n    await _repository.SaveAsync();\r\n    return SuccessResult();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n`HttpRequest.Form` is safe if the form has already been loaded. People who know and rely on that behavior and like the terseness of `HttpRequest.Form` would be impacted.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

We've decided to walk this back though.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nYou can add a custom convention that removes the `MethodInfo` from the endpoint metadata or wait for RC 2 to revert this behavior.

There are multiple options to avoid this behavior:\r\n* Make your `BindAsync` or `TryParse` method internal or private\r\n* Add a new `BindAsync` or `TryParse` method that is in the syntax we are looking for (we ignore invalid methods if we find a valid one)\r\n* Mark your parameter as `[FromBody]`\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAll `IEndpointRouteBuilder.Map*(...)` methods are affected by this change, e.g. `app.MapGet(...)` and `app.MapPost(...)`.\r\nAnd `RequestDelegateFactory.Create(...)`\r\n\r\nDiscussion issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/36810","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/472","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: TryParse and BindAsync discovery on Map* parameters will throw for invalid methods\" (#472)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1640761299255836673","CreatedAt":"2023-03-28T17:02:32+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"We're live, come join us!\n\nhttps://t.co/9oypiWcbkl https://t.co/DzZfgdjoCB","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":13,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1640760727974854656","CreatedAt":"2023-03-28T17:00:16+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgrKZI8 Community Standup - DotNetIsolator - Experimental isolated .NET code sandbox https://t.co/WlnQgvw2ba","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":14,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1635720338721095680","CreatedAt":"2023-03-14T19:11:33+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"🚀#AspNetCore updates in .NET 8 Preview 2\n\n▦ Blazor QuickGrid\n🚀 Blazor WebAssembly perf with jiterpreter\n☑️New minim… https://t.co/5X1isLeKFk","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":28,"FavoriteCount":12,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1635687569194364931","CreatedAt":"2023-03-14T17:01:20+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgrKZI8 Community Standup - Blazor App Testing with Playwright https://t.co/BmecM2jrIJ","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":6,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1635687363811897344","CreatedAt":"2023-03-14T17:00:31+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"We're live!

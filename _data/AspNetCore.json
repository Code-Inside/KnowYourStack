Please describe.\r\nIsn't a problem. But can improve security for API's\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nChange the default way to sign JWT's\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nHi guys, \r\n\r\nAt ASP.NET MVC after a successful login, ASP.NET generate a Cookie, encrypt it and send to user. Great. The dev doesn't really knows how it was generated. I could say that there are many devs maybe doesn't know it is encrypted. Or worst, why we use it. Anyway.\r\n\r\nBut it's really common nowadays the dev's create REST API's. And they need to emit a JWT Token instead. While the first case they don't need to care about how it works under the hood. But with JWT, they need to digitally sign it. Create a key. Store and manage it. \r\n\r\nDefinetely isn't a simple Task. HMAC keys need to have a 64 bit key. Rotate every 90 days and so on. \r\nI'll not mention that I've never seen someone using RSA / ECDsa. It's a dream.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at DataProtection component, it accomplish the task in a very competent way. Rotate the key every 90 days. There is an good fit with azure App Service. Many extensions to store it in a safe place.\r\n\r\nSo I've two questions: \r\n\r\n1. Why we don't provide a better way to sign-in a token with DataProtection masterKey? \r\n2. Do you see any flaws of security doing it in this way:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n\r\n    [ApiController]\r\n    [Route(\"jwt-protection\")]\r\n    public class JwtFromDataProtectionKeys : ControllerBase\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly IKeyRingProvider _keyRingProvider;\r\n        private readonly IKeyManager _keyManager;\r\n\r\n        public JwtFromDataProtectionKeys(\r\n            IKeyRingProvider keyRingProvider,\r\n            IKeyManager keyManager)\r\n        {\r\n            _keyRingProvider = keyRingProvider;\r\n            _keyManager = keyManager;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Get current key.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        private JsonWebKey CreateJwk()\r\n        {\r\n            // Get current key ring from DataProtection\r\n            var currentKeyRing = _keyRingProvider.GetCurrentKeyRing();\r\n\r\n            // Identify current KeyId\r\n            var defaultKeyId = currentKeyRing.DefaultKeyId;\r\n\r\n            // Get private key from current keyid\r\n            var storedKey = _keyManager.GetAllKeys().First(f => f.KeyId == defaultKeyId);\r\n            var descriptorXmlInfo = storedKey.Descriptor.ExportToXml();\r\n            var key = new XElement(\"key\", descriptorXmlInfo.SerializedDescriptorElement.LastNode).Value;\r\n\r\n            // generate jwk.

Whenever the user is not authenticated and Blazor app tries to make a call to secured api via configured httpClient it results in a NullReferenceException being thrown, instead of expected AccessTokenNotAvailableException.\r\nStackTrace:\r\n```\r\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication.AuthorizationMessageHandler.SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n         at Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Logging.LoggingScopeHttpMessageHandler.SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n         at System.Net.Http.HttpClient.SendAsyncCore(HttpRequestMessage request, HttpCompletionOption completionOption, Boolean async, Boolean emitTelemetryStartStop, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have narrowed it down to this bit of code:\r\n ```\r\n var tokenResult = _tokenOptions != null ?\r\n      await _provider.RequestAccessToken(_tokenOptions) :\r\n      await _provider.RequestAccessToken();\r\n\r\n  if (tokenResult.TryGetToken(out var token))\r\n  {\r\n      _lastToken = token;\r\n      _cachedHeader = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", _lastToken.Value);\r\n  }\r\n  else\r\n  {\r\n      throw new AccessTokenNotAvailableException(_navigation, tokenResult, _tokenOptions?.Scopes);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically when the user is not authenticated the tokenResult I get from provider will for whatever reason still have a success status, yet the inner token in that result is null. TryGetToken method on AccessTokenResult will only check for success status and will return true even if the token is null:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public bool TryGetToken(out AccessToken accessToken)\r\n  {\r\n      if (Status == AccessTokenResultStatus.Success)\r\n      {\r\n          accessToken = _token;\r\n          return true;\r\n      }\r\n      else\r\n      {\r\n          accessToken = null;\r\n          return false;\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo naturally, when it proceeds in the 1st bit of code it will pass the if statement and try to get a value from a null token, resulting in a NullReferenceException:\r\n\r\n`_cachedHeader = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", _lastToken.Value); // _lastToken is null here`\r\n\r\nI may be wrong and it is an expected behavior, but according to documentation making a call to a secure API should result in a AccessTokenNotAvailableException instead of NullReferenceException.\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios?view=aspnetcore-5.0#attach-tokens-to-outgoing-requests\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a project via dotnet command described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-azure-active-directory-b2c?view=aspnetcore-5.0\r\n`dotnet new blazorwasm -au IndividualB2C --aad-b2c-instance \"{AAD B2C INSTANCE}\" --api-client-id \"{SERVER API APP CLIENT ID}\" --app-id-uri \"{SERVER API APP ID URI}\" --client-id \"{CLIENT APP CLIENT ID}\" --default-scope \"{DEFAULT SCOPE}\" --domain \"{TENANT DOMAIN}\" -ho -o {APP NAME} -ssp \"{SIGN UP OR SIGN IN POLICY}\"`\r\n\r\n- In Client/Pages/FetchData.razor remove \"[Authorize]\" attribute\r\n- Run project\r\n- Navigate to fetch data while being unauthenticated\r\n- Unhandled NullReferenceException exception is thrown\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\nNullReferenceException\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly 5.0.3\r\n- Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal 5.0.3","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30538","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NullReferenceException thrown when making a call to secured API while not authenticated in Blazor WASM app with MSAL auth\" (#30538)"},{"Id":"818288346","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-28T09:10:41","Actor":"Prakul2006","Number":"30539","RawContent":null,"Title":"Package dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator 5.0.2 is not compatible with netcoreapp3.1","State":"open","Body":"Hi i was following this guide [First Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-5.0) but while doing this [Scaffold a Controller](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio-mac#scaffold-a-controller) I get this error please help.\r\n` error NU1202: Package dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator 5.0.2 is not compatible with netcoreapp3.1 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1) / any.

Based on if a parameter is set, the component renders different data. Let's say the third-party component is called `Foo`. I can either call\r\n```\r\n<Foo />\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n<Foo>\r\n    <Bar>stuff</Bar>\r\n</Foo>\r\n```\r\nHowever, I want to conditionally set `Bar`, based on an external state. This doesn't compile:\r\n```\r\n<Foo>\r\n    @if (renderBar)\r\n    {\r\n        <Bar>stuff</Bar>\r\n    }\r\n</Foo>\r\n``` \r\nThe next compiles, but doesn't have the intended effect: if `renderBar=false` `Bar` is empty and not null, so the wrong data is being rendered by the third-party component.\r\n```\r\n<Foo>\r\n    <Bar>\r\n        if (renderBar)\r\n        {\r\n            <p>stuff</p>\r\n        }\r\n    </Bar>\r\n</Foo>\r\n```\r\nSo I've tried setting `Bar` null manually, e.g.\r\n```\r\n<Foo Bar=@(renderBar?bar:null) />\r\n@code{\r\n    private RenderFragment bar = (builder) => { builder.AddMarkupContent(0, \"<p>stuff</p>\"); };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut now, when `renderBar=false` I get an exception \"Delegate to an instance method cannot have null 'this'.\" (seen below)\r\n\r\nI know Internally the third party component uses something like (but not exactly)\r\n```\r\n@if (Bar is null)\r\n{\r\n    ..render other stuff..\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    render @Bar\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo it's weird to me: **Something is rendered bases on if the parameter is null or not, _but you cannot set the parameter to null yourself._**\r\n\r\nI think this is a bug, or at least an issue. I would like to conditionally set a RenderFragment parameter of a component.\r\n\r\nNote 1: I know a possible solution would be to have\r\n```\r\nif (renderBar)\r\n{\r\n    <Foo>\r\n        <Bar>stuff</Bar>\r\n    </Foo>\r\n} else {\r\n    <Foo />\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, this is not a good solution for us: the real third party component has many more parameters that we set, and we don't want so much code duplication in our code.\r\n\r\nNote 2: I saw [this question and answer](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29860), but as the receiving components are third-party, I cannot add anything to them.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`. This will not affect any typical application code as it is only a detail of the low-level platform implementation.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe property `EventArgsType` described a nonstandard, Blazor-specific category name for groups of DOM event types. For example, the `click` and `mousedown` events were both mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `mouse`. Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`. There is no longer a need to supply a Blazor-specific category name, so the old property `EventArgsType` is removed.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nIn PR [#29993](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/29993) we have introduced support for custom event arguments classes. As part of this, we no longer rely on all events fitting into a predefined set of categories. The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

All breaking changes to nullability annotations will be aggregated into this issue throughout the course of .NET 6.0.**_\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0, we have been applying nullability annotations to parts of ASP.NET Core. From the outset of this effort, [we anticipated that mistakes would be made](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/api-guidelines/nullability.md#breaking-change-guidance) in these annotations and fixes would need to be made. In .NET 6.0, we are updating some annotations that have been previously applied. Some of these changes are considered source breaking changes because it leads to the APIs being incompatible or more restrictive, or could result in build-time warnings when used in projects that have nullable reference types enabled.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27564 for further discussions.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe affected APIs had incorrect nullable reference type annotations and build warnings were either absent or incorrect.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNew build warnings will be produced and incorrect build warnings will no longer be produced for the affected APIs.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThrough feedback and further testing, the nullable annotations for the affected APIs were determined to be inaccurate.

For example, if a razor class library defined a static web asset to be served under `/folder/file.txt` and the host placed a file under `wwwroot/folder/file.txt` the file on the server would silently override the file on the Razor Class Library or Blazor Webassembly application.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core will now correctly detect when this issue happens and inform of the conflict so that users can be aware and take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis was a bug in the implementation, we never intended for static web assets to be \"overridable\" by files on the wwwroot host of the project since that leads to errors that are hard to diagnose and can result in undefined behavior changes when applications are published.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason for a file on a Razor Class Library to conflict with a file on the host by default since they are prefixed with `_content/${PackageId}` unless we are discussing Blazor Webassembly applications, which get placed by default at the root of the host url space, which makes conflicts easier. (For example, Blazor Webassembly Applications contain a favicon.ico that the host might also include in their wwwroot folder).\r\n\r\nIf the source of the conflict is a file in a Razor Class Library it normally means there is some code that copies the assets from the library into the wwwroot folder of the project. We don't recommend developers doing that since it defeats one of the main goals of static web assets which is that files don't have to be copied around, which is fundamental to get updates on the browser when the contents are updated without having to trigger a new compilation.\r\n\r\nIf despite that you want to preserve this behavior and maintain the file on the host, you can do so by removing the file from the list of static web assets with a custom MSBuild target.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the file on the razor class library or the blazor webassembly file instead of the file from the host project, just remove the file from the host project.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updated validation logic for Static Web Assets\" (#443)"},{"Id":"724794249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T19:05:24","Actor":"tatti9018","Number":"442","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"Help with feature “Control Startup class activation”\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n            .ConfigureWebHost(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.UseStartup(context => new Startup(logger));\r\n            })\r\n            .Build();\r\n```\r\nWhen I use Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly”, I get error: ‘IHostBuilder’ does not contain a definition for ‘ConfigureWebHostDefaults’\r\nWhen I set Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, project see ConfigureWebHostDefaults, but project doesn’t work….","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/442","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work\" (#442)"},{"Id":"712253766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-30T20:21:51","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5","State":"open","Body":"## Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5\r\n\r\n.NET 5 introduces a variety of [new Blazor features](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514), some of which are not compatible with certain older browsers.

The functionality provided by these packages was based on the AzureAD v1.0 endpoint. \r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0 integration with AzureAD and AzureAD B2C authentication will be provided by [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web) which is based on Microsoft Identity Platform (formerly known as AzureAD v2.0 endpoint). As such, we are deprecating the old APIs in the AzureAD.UI and AzureADB2C.UI packages.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 Preview 8\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThese APIs were not Obsolete.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThey are now Obsolete.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe are migrating the functionality to MSAL APIs provided by Microsoft.Identity.Web, which is built from [this repository](https://github.com/azuread/microsoft-identity-web).\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nFollow the documentation at https://github.com/azuread/microsoft-identity-web/wiki.

Starting from ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1, all of those readonly public fields have changed to readonly public properties.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect this change to affect many developers because:\r\n\r\n * Any application or library that simply uses `.razor` files (or even manual `RenderTreeBuilder` calls) to define its components would not be referencing this type directly\r\n * The `RenderTreeFrame` type itself is regarded as an implementation detail, not intended for use outside the framework. ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later includes an analyzer that issues compiler warnings if the type is being used directly.\r\n * Even if you do reference `RenderTreeFrame` directly, this change is binary-breaking but not source-breaking. That is, your existing source code will still compile and behave properly. You will only encounter an issue if compiling against the 3.x framework and then running those binaries against the 5.0 RC1 and later framework.\r\n\r\n## Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1\r\n\r\n## Old behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` were defined as fields, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\n## New behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` are defined as properties with the same names as before, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\nIf older precompiled code has not been recompiled since this change, it may throw an exception similar to *MissingFieldException: Field not found: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame.FrameType'*.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary in order to implement some high-impact performance improvements in Blazor component rendering on ASP.NET Core 5.0 while retaining the same level of safety and encapsulation as before.\r\n\r\n## Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Blazor developers will not be affected and do not need to take action. This is most likely to affect library/package authors, but still only rarely. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* If you are developing an application, and either staying on ASP.NET Core 3.x or upgrading to 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to make any changes to your own code.\r\n   * However if you depend on a library that needs to upgrade to account for this change, then you would need to update to a newer version of that library.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support only ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to take any action. Just ensure that your `csproj` declares the `TargetFramework` value `net5.0`.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support both ASP.NET Core 3.x *and* 5.0, then check whether or not your code attempts to read any of the members of `RenderTreeFrame` (for example, evaluating `someRenderTreeFrame.FrameType`).\r\n    * Most libraries will not do that. This includes libraries that contain `.razor` components. In this case you don't need to take any action.\r\n    * However, if your library does do that, then you will need to use multitargeting to support both `netstandard2.1` and `net5.0`. First, in your `csproj`, replace the existing `<TargetFramework>` with `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`. Then instead of referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` with a fixed version number such as 3.0.0, use a conditional reference to account for both versions you wish to support. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"3.0.0\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"5.0.0-rc.1.*\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' != 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further clarification, see this [diff showing how @jsakamoto already upgraded his `Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement` library in this way](https://github.com/jsakamoto/Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement/commit/090df430ba725f9420d412753db8104e8c32bf51).\r\n\r\n## Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fields on RenderTreeFrame have become properties\" (#438)"},{"Id":"696062913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T17:46:46","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the default behavior of `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBy default, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found (i.e. the exception handler returns a 404) when the middleware executes. To allow 404 responses to be returned by the exception handler, please configure the option `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. When this option is set to true, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run.

So, starting with .NET 5 preview 7, the `.razor` compiler will omit insignificant whitespace by default.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, this will not have any effect on the visual layout of the rendered component, since the whitespace nodes being removed would not normally affect it. However, the whitespace might affect the rendered output if you are using a CSS rule like `white-space: pre`. If you need to preserve the whitespace, you can use the new directive `@preservewhitespace true` at the top of your `.razor` file, or inside an `_Imports.razor` file to apply the preference to an entire subdirectory or even your whole project.\r\n\r\nFor further discussions, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23568\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following `.razor` code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n    @foreach (var item in Items)\r\n    {\r\n        <li>\r\n            @item.Text\r\n        </li>\r\n    }\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would previously have rendered two whitespace nodes outside the `@foreach`, and then two more around the `<li>`, and then two more around `@item.Text`. If the list contained 100 items, this would have been 402 whitespace nodes - i.e., more than half of all nodes rendered, even though none of them would visually affect the rendered output. Eliminating them at compile time greatly improves performance for rendering and diffing.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes were preserved\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes are removed if:\r\n\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within an element\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within a `RenderFragment` parameter (e.g., child content being passed to another component)\r\n * ... they precede or follow a C# code block such as an `@if`, `@foreach`, etc.\r\n\r\n... except if the `@preservewhitespace` directive is used with value `true`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nPerformance. See above.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIn most cases no action is required, as applications will typically continue to behave normally (but faster).

Libraries that reference one of these packages can either update their target framework to net5.0 or multi-target depending on their requirements.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/425","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.*, Microsoft.JSInterop.* packages will no longer target netstandard2.1\" (#425)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1366554663986683907","CreatedAt":"2021-03-02T01:03:15+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"On this week's #AspNet Community Standup:\n🔦Web Live Preview🔦 \n⭐Featuring @sayedihashimi and @tlmii \n\n🗓Tuesday | Mar… https://t.co/EmmTFzWVK7","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":4,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1364667042305961988","CreatedAt":"2021-02-24T20:02:31+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"🏗App Building with @Azure API Management, @AzureFunctions , @MSPowerApps, and @LogicAppsIO.\n\n@bradygaster wraps up… https://t.co/MO3oIIOyNU","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":36,"FavoriteCount":13,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1364334230981910529","CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T22:00:03+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Next month's (March 9th) #Blazor community standup is all about contributing to Blazor.\n\nLet us know what questions… https://t.co/JYvS781QY7","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":15,"FavoriteCount":7,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1364273432842543106","CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T17:58:28+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Community Standup - Building HTTP APIs https://t.co/okOXzLLKoR","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":9,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1364273282556391424","CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T17:57:52+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

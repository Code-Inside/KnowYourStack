This meant:\n\n- Browsers showed certificate errors: \"This certificate is not yet valid\"\n- Visual Studio couldn't use the certificate immediately after creation\n- Developers had to wait hours before the certificate became usable\n\n## Root Cause\n\nTwo files were using `DateTimeOffset.Now` instead of `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`:\n- `src/Tools/dotnet-dev-certs/src/Program.cs` (line 374)\n- `src/Tools/FirstRunCertGenerator/src/CertificateGenerator.cs` (line 14)\n\n## Solution\n\nChanged both instances from `DateTimeOffset.Now` to `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` to ensure certificates are created with UTC-based timestamps, making them immediately valid regardless of local timezone.\n\n## Testing\n\n- All existing tests continue to pass\n- Added comprehensive test case to verify proper UTC time handling\n- Manual verification shows certificates now created with UTC timestamps (e.g., `Valid from 2025-08-15 21:20:52Z`)\n\nThe fix is minimal, surgical, and ensures certificates work correctly in all timezones without breaking existing functionality.\n\nFixes #63003.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

The fix:\n\n1. Adds a `GetDisplayText()` method to `CommandOption` that properly formats option names with comma-space separators\n2. Updates `CommandLineApplication.GetHelpText()` to use the formatted display text instead of the raw template\n3. Maintains support for all option types: symbol options (`-?`), short options (`-h`), long options (`--help`), and value parameters (`<PROJECT>`)\n\nThe improved formatting enhances readability and follows modern CLI conventions. This change affects all tools that use the shared CommandLineUtils library, including `dotnet-openapi` and `dotnet-getdocument` as a bonus improvement.\n\nAll existing functionality is preserved, and all tests continue to pass.\n\nFixes #62716.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Please describe the problem.\n\nViewComponents are analogous to MVC with views, where one controller (viewcomponent) can have multiple views (views). For simple viewcomponents it creates quite some directory boilerplate, even if it uses just the `Default` view:\n\n```\nMyProject\n├─ Pages\n│  ├─ Shared\n│  │  ├─ Components\n│  │  │  ├─ FooViewComponent\n│  │  │  │  └─ Default.cshtml\n│  │  │  └─ FooViewComponent.cs\n```\n\n```cs\n// FooViewComponent.cs\npublic class FooViewComponent(MyDbContext ctx) : ViewComponent\n{\n    public async Task<IViewComponentResult> InvokeAsync(int id)\n    {\n        var foo = await ctx.Foos\n            .Where(f => f.Id == id)\n            .ProjectToDto()\n            .FirstOrDefaultAsync();\n        return View(foo);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- Default.cshtml -->\n@model FooDto\n\n<h3>@Model.Name</h3>\n<img src=\"@Model.Image\" />\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like something closer to what Razor Pages offer, that is a simple `.cshtml`-`.cshtml.cs` pair.\n\n```\nMyProject\n├─ Pages\n│  ├─ Components\n│  │  ├─ FooComponent.cshtml.cs\n│  │  └─ FooComponent.cs\n```\n\n```cs\n// FooComponent.cshtml.cs\npublic class FooComponent(MyDbContext ctx) : PageComponent\n{\n    public required FooDto Data { get; set; }\n\n    public async Task<IPageComponentResult> InvokeAsync(int id)\n    {\n        Data = await ctx.Foos\n            .Where(f => f.Id == id)\n            .ProjectToDto()\n            .FirstOrDefaultAsync();\n        return Component();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- Default.cshtml -->\n@model FooViewComponent\n\n<h3>@Model.Data.Name</h3>\n<img src=\"@Model.Data.Image\" />\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nGoing a step further, the component would not use a duck-typed `InvokeAsync`, but rather it would be an abstract method on `PageComponent`. In that case, parameters would probably have to be declared either in the constructor, or by using some `[Parameter]` attribute. Some loose suggestions:\n\nConstructor parameters?\n```cs\n// Perhaps it could be automatically detected, that the ctor params that don't\n// exist in the DI container are component parameters, thus removing the need\n// for an attibute?\npublic class FooComponent([Parameter] int id, MyDbContext ctx) : PageComponent\n{\n    public required FooDto Data { get; set; }\n\n    public override async Task<IPageComponentResult> InvokeAsync()\n    {\n       ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nProperties?\n```cs\npublic class FooComponent(MyDbContext ctx) : PageComponent\n{\n    [Parameter]\n    public required int Id { get; set; }\n    public required FooDto Data { get; set; }\n\n    public override async Task<IPageComponentResult> InvokeAsync()\n    {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nGeneric `PageComponent` with a `T Data` property that never gets treated as a parameter?\n```cs\npublic class FooComponent(MyDbContext ctx) : PageComponent<FooDto>\n{\n    public required int Id { get; set; }\n\n    public override async Task<IPageComponentResult> InvokeAsync()\n    {\n        Data = ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCould maybe make the `PageComponent<T>.Data` the `@Model` for easier access too:\n```html\n@model FooViewComponent\n\n<h3>@Model.Name</h3>\n<img src=\"@Model.Image\" />\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63273","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Razor Pages equivalent of ViewComponents\" (#63273)"},{"Id":"3325226421","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-15T12:56:25","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"63272","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] (deps): Bump src/submodules/googletest from `373af2e` to `244cec8`","State":"open","Body":"Bumps [src/submodules/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) from `373af2e` to `244cec8`.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/244cec869d12e53378fa0efb610cd4c32a454ec8\"><code>244cec8</code></a> Update the document in typed tests to use using-declaration instead of typedef</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/googletest/compare/373af2e3df71599b87a40ce0e37164523849166b...244cec869d12e53378fa0efb610cd4c32a454ec8\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

The `EndpointBuilder` provides access to the application services (`IServiceProvider`) and endpoint metadata (`IList<object>`) previously provided by `EndpointMetadataContext` and `EndpointParameterMetadataContext`.\r\n\r\nNow, `IEndpointMetadataProvider` takes a `MethodInfo` and `IEndpointParameterMetadataProvider` takes a `ParameterInfo` as their first parameter.\r\n\r\nBoth `EndpointMetadataContext` and `EndpointParameterMetadataContext` have been removed.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43125#issuecomment-1218534849 for an API diff.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe metadata providers now get access to more metadata like the `RoutePattern` (with a downcast) and `DisplayName` via the `EndpointBuilder`, and this allowed us to delete unnecessary context types.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nUpdate implementations of `IEndpointMetadataProvider` and `IEndpointParameterMetadataProvider` to access the information necessary from the new parameters.

We use Okta in a federated scenario. The request to Okta ```/authorize``` endpoint includes ```clientId```, ```openId``` scope with response type set to ```id_token```. The above error was only returned by one of the two Okta tenants we tested with. The exception was thrown in ```OpenIdConnectHandler.GetPushedAuthorizationRequestUri```.\n\nAfter inspecting the following commit https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/commit/bef4dae08b8dae56bcf2f356f3bee66184bb2dee#diff-4241f2e2b0ba30cfdc11b53849a5574912f65ab3c7bfc710a93c3176f0b3e49a , we realized that the default for ```PushedAuthorizationBehavior``` in ```OpenIdConnectOptions``` is set to ```PushedAuthorizationBehavior.UseIfAvailable```. The Okta instance which returned the error had ```pushed_authorization_request_endpoint``` listed in its discovery document while the other instance did not. Neither had ```require_pushed_authorization_requests``` flag set to enabled. \n\nThe ```UseIfAvailable``` default forced the request to go via PAR backchannel. Subsequently, the Okta instance that exposed ```pushed_authorization_request_endpoint``` started requiring client secret when request came via PAR. It probably treats PAR as a dedicated confidential client channel. Our app didn't originally supply a secret as it was configured as public client. The fix was to set ```PushedAuthorizationBehavior = PushedAuthorizationBehavior.Disable``` in our code. In light of this, I was wondering if a better ```PushedAuthorizationBehavior``` default should be ```PushedAuthorizationBehavior.Disable```. Alternatively, the intent could be expressed by client setting ```UsePushedAuthorization``` bool as was initially proposed by @josephdecock in this discussion - https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51686 - but doesn't appear to be implemented. \n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe oidc challenge continues to work after upgrade to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect 9.0.0.0 for all existing scenarios.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\n﻿Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect.OpenIdConnectProtocolException: Message contains error: 'invalid_client', error_description: 'The client secret supplied for a confidential client is invalid.', error_uri: 'error_uri is null'.\n﻿   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect.OpenIdConnectHandler.GetPushedAuthorizationRequestUri(HttpResponseMessage parResponseMessage)\n﻿   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect.OpenIdConnectHandler.PushAuthorizationRequest(OpenIdConnectMessage authorizeRequest, AuthenticationProperties properties)\n﻿   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect.OpenIdConnectHandler.HandleChallengeAsyncInternal(AuthenticationProperties properties)\n﻿   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect.OpenIdConnectHandler.HandleChallengeAsync(AuthenticationProperties properties)\n```\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0\n\n### Anything else?\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51686\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/commit/bef4dae08b8dae56bcf2f356f3bee66184bb2dee#diff-4241f2e2b0ba30cfdc11b53849a5574912f65ab3c7bfc710a93c3176f0b3e49a","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62166","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"PushedAuthorizationBehavior default in OidcHandler PAR\" (#62166)"},{"Id":"3101473546","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T20:59:18","Actor":"jzabroski","Number":"62164","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixes #62163: Fix incorrect summary for CreateViewComponent.","State":"open","Body":"# Fixes #62163: Fix incorrect summary for CreateViewComponent.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI was digging through documentation on View Components to understand how it all works, and noticed this typo.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62164","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fixes #62163: Fix incorrect summary for CreateViewComponent.\" (#62164)"},{"Id":"3101465375","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T20:55:05","Actor":"jzabroski","Number":"62163","RawContent":null,"Title":"Documentation says \"controller\", should say \"view component\"","State":"open","Body":"From:\n> `Creates a new controller for the specified <paramref name=\"context\"/>.`\n\nTo: \n> `Creates a new view component for the specified <paramref name=\"context\"/>.`\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/6009a58a5e53db068a42d27519af3b3bf3d67568/src/Mvc/Mvc.ViewFeatures/src/ViewComponents/IViewComponentFactory.cs#L11-L16\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62163","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Documentation says \"controller\", should say \"view component\"\" (#62163)"},{"Id":"3101402347","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T20:23:22","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"62162","RawContent":null,"Title":"Implement IConnectionEndPointFeature in Kestrel's TransportConnection","State":"open","Body":"This PR implements `IConnectionEndPointFeature` in Kestrel's `TransportConnection` class to address the issue where this feature was only available in test scenarios via `DefaultConnectionContext`.\n\n## Background\n\n`IConnectionEndPointFeature` was added as part of bedrock in #10321 but was only implemented in `DefaultConnectionContext`, which is primarily used by test projects. This meant that production Kestrel connections couldn't access endpoint information through the standard feature interface.\n\n## Changes\n\nThe implementation adds `IConnectionEndPointFeature` support to `TransportConnection` by:\n\n1. **Adding the feature to code generation configuration** - Updated `TransportConnectionFeatureCollection.cs` to include `IConnectionEndPointFeature` in both `allFeatures` and `implementedFeatures` arrays\n2. **Regenerating feature collection code** - Used the existing code generator to update `TransportConnection.Generated.cs` with the new feature support\n3. **Implementing the feature interface** - Added implementation methods in `TransportConnection.FeatureCollection.cs` that delegate to the existing `LocalEndPoint` and `RemoteEndPoint` properties\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter this change, applications can access connection endpoints through the feature interface:\n\n```csharp\nvar endpointFeature = connectionContext.Features.Get<IConnectionEndPointFeature>();\nvar localEndpoint = endpointFeature?.LocalEndPoint;\nvar remoteEndpoint = endpointFeature?.RemoteEndPoint;\n```\n\nThis maintains full compatibility with existing code that uses the direct properties while providing the standard feature interface for consistency with other ASP.NET Core components.\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Minimal changes**: Only 3 files modified with 41 additions and 3 deletions\n- **No breaking changes**: Existing code continues to work unchanged\n- **Consistent API**: Provides the same endpoint access pattern used elsewhere in ASP.NET Core\n- **Production ready**: Makes the feature available in real Kestrel connections, not just tests\n\nFixes #43786.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config)\n>\n> </details>\n\n\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

I have a problem with the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication(v8.0.8) package. More specifically with the  AuthenticationService.js. The problem is the following - whenever I open my Blazor app inside of an iframe I have to wait 10 seconds before the authentication starts. \nHere is the place where the timeout gets set\n\n `return t.prototype.navigate = function(t) {\n                        if (t && t.url) {\n                            var e = t.silentRequestTimeout || 1e4;\n                            i.Log.debug(\"IFrameWindow.navigate: Using timeout of:\", e),\n                            this._timer = window.setTimeout(this._timeout.bind(this), e),\n                            this._frame.src = t.url\n                        } else\n                            this._error(\"No url provided\");\n                        return this.promise\n                    }`\n\n the t.silentRequestTimeout is always undefined so it takes 1e4.

HashSets<T> doesn't generate correctly as it should include `\"uniqueItems\": true`. See SampleModel.ShouldHaveUniqueItemsTrue prop.\n2. long props are generated as `integer` | `string` types with a regex pattern. This should just be numeric, no regex. See SampleModel.ShouldNotHaveRegexPattern (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61038 I think this covers it) \n3. [Required] public required string ShouldHaveMinLength { get; init; } is marked as required but doens't have a `minlength`. See SampleModel.ShouldNotHaveRegexPattern\n4. Enums with `JsonStringEnumMemberName` are not handled. You have to specifically set `[JsonConverter(typeof(StringEnumConverter))]`. See StackStatusWithJsonStringEnumMemberName Maybe https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59980 ? Either way this should be handled out of the box without needing a converter?\n5. Version Props are missing the version pattern `\"pattern\": \"^\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+){1,3}$\"`. See  SampleModel.Version\n6. Schemas is missing child types. For example I have CountResult which has a `Dictionary<string, IAggregate>`. IAggregate is not genereated nor any derived types.\n7. Enums are missing description, and `x-enumNames`. See SampleModel.BillingStatus (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58230#issuecomment-2569756615) kind of covers this, but not addressed and **`x-ms-enum` is not an industry standard and should be removed (If it is included this way which it is not).**\n8. `/// <response code=\"404\">The web hook could not be found.</response>` are missing from the generated output. See [HttpGet(\"open-api-model-issue\")]\n9. Xml Documentation includes special new line characters that differ from previous versions. As such `<code>` blocks render incorrectly in different user interfaces driven off the json. see `[HttpPost(\"post-body-issue-and-comments-issue\")]`\n10. No support for detecting which endpoints access Request.Body for streaming purposes. As such documentation is lacking. It should be assumed body is read if you have `[Consumes(\"application/json\", \"text/plain\")]`\n11. Any type inside of `Task<ActionResult<WorkInProgressResult>>` (e.g., `WorkInProgressResult` is not included in the schema. See `[HttpDelete(\"{ids}\")]`. I should not need `[ProducesResponseType(typeof(WorkInProgressResult), StatusCodes.Status202Accepted)]`.\n12. Delta<> From OData days generates really weird. I don't have it included here but it generates a schema for each T in.. OData<T> (e.g., DeltaOfUpdateUser) See (https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/blob/feature/net-10-upgrade-with-open-api-changes/src/Exceptionless.Web/Controllers/UserController.cs#L120)\n13. Not in the sample but ` public ICollection<OAuthAccount> OAuthAccounts { get; } = new Collection<OAuthAccount>();` should generate `readOnly: true` but does not.\n14. I'm pretty sure I had to add `services.ConfigureHttpJsonOptions` to get somethings to work can't remember what but I think it for casing to be picked up for `JsonPropertyName` in generation. This is weird and should just work if I have `services.AddJsonOptions`.\n15.

Exception message:`\nXML Details:\n```\n<Event xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event\">\n <System>\n  <Provider Name=\"IIS AspNetCore Module V2\" /> \n  <EventID Qualifiers=\"0\">1034</EventID> \n  <Version>0</Version> \n  <Level>2</Level> \n  <Task>0</Task> \n  <Opcode>0</Opcode> \n  <Keywords>0x80000000000000</Keywords> \n  <TimeCreated SystemTime=\"2025-05-28T20:28:01.5405669Z\" /> \n  <EventRecordID>167788</EventRecordID> \n  <Correlation /> \n  <Execution ProcessID=\"36092\" ThreadID=\"0\" /> \n  <Channel>Application</Channel> \n  <Computer>[redacted]</Computer> \n  <Security /> \n </System>\n <EventData>\n  <Data>Could not load configuration.

In the _Expected behavior_ section later I cover this.\n\nNow, adding a tiny bit of complexity in the form of indirectly (via local Users group) allowing the worker process to _read/traverse_ the shadow copy directory, but still not allowing any _modification_ produces what I would argue to be an even more confusing set of outputs, including in the ANCM enhanced logs.\n\n**Application Event Viewer log:**\n(including just the raw XML data from the 2 events that were output)\n_first event:_\n```\n<EventData>\n  <Data>Application 'c:\\behindiis-shadowcopy\\0' failed to start.

The error code 8007023e is also not helpful.\nOnly manually navigating to that directory and looking for the EXE that it couldn't find would show that it is, in fact, not there. So now trying to figure out why it's not there when it said it was makes it all the more difficult to figure out, especially since we now know it's a permissions-related issue and there's not a hint of that in any output here.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe errors being output to the various logs around shadow copy failures should be more concise and should help with diagnosing problems with it. Shadow copy historically has not been easy to troubleshoot, especially when even the simplest of permissions issues results in no useful, or, worse, misleading, debugging output.\nAt a minimum, being the only log enabled and used by default here, the Application Event Viewer log entries need to have something useful, because right now it doesn't. The issues demonstrated here are, yes, simple problems that could probably be figured out pretty quick to some people, but troubleshooting more complex issues with shadow copy could potentially be much more efficient and quick if even the basic output was valuable.\n\nFor the first issue above where no permissions were present on the shadow copy directory, the event log should really include the exception message as opposed to swallowing it and outputting the generic error:\nThis code is here:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/05c5d65ceb6a59dd7aa5feaeb38a59f338d2c7f1/src/Servers/IIS/AspNetCoreModuleV2/AspNetCore/applicationinfo.cpp#L150\n\n```\n    catch (const ConfigurationLoadException &ex)\n    {\n        EventLog::Error(\n            ASPNETCORE_CONFIGURATION_LOAD_ERROR,\n            ASPNETCORE_CONFIGURATION_LOAD_ERROR_MSG,\n            ex.get_message().c_str());\n    }\n    catch (...)\n    {\n        OBSERVE_CAUGHT_EXCEPTION();\n        EventLog::Error(\n            ASPNETCORE_CONFIGURATION_LOAD_ERROR,\n            ASPNETCORE_CONFIGURATION_LOAD_ERROR_MSG,\n            L\"\");\n    }\n```\n\nFor the 2nd scenario where the app has read-only permissions to the shadow copy directory, this is the code that outputs the successful-sounding \"finished copying..\" message even though it wasn't:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/05c5d65ceb6a59dd7aa5feaeb38a59f338d2c7f1/src/Servers/IIS/AspNetCoreModuleV2/AspNetCore/applicationinfo.cpp#L337-L345\n```\n        HRESULT hr = Environment::CopyToDirectory(physicalPath, shadowCopyPath, options.QueryCleanShadowCopyDirectory(), shadowCopyBaseDirectory.path(), copiedFileCount);\n\n        LOG_INFOF(L\"Finished copying %d files to shadow copy directory %ls.\", copiedFileCount, shadowCopyBaseDirectory.path().c_str());\n\n        if (hr != S_OK)\n        {\n            return std::wstring();\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThat is in the `HandleShadowCopy` function, and if the copy fails then an empty string is returned to the caller here:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/05c5d65ceb6a59dd7aa5feaeb38a59f338d2c7f1/src/Servers/IIS/AspNetCoreModuleV2/AspNetCore/applicationinfo.cpp#L196-L198\n```\n    auto shadowCopyPath = HandleShadowCopy(options, pHttpContext);\n\n    RETURN_IF_FAILED(m_handlerResolver.GetApplicationFactory(*pHttpContext.GetApplication(), shadowCopyPath, m_pApplicationFactory, options, error));\n```\nAt that point, the code moves-on like nothing happened (and indeed the debug logging indicates all is well too at this point), only to fail down the road with a whole bunch of failure output that doesn't really help. \nIf shadow copy is enabled but returns an empty directory, should ANCM really continue moving forward?\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nTake any simple ANC project, ensure it's hosted in IIS and has shadow copy enabled in the web.config. Then ensure the needed permissions are not applied.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is on the latest non-preview version of the hosting bundle (9.0.5) with ANCM version: **19.0.25119.5**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62148","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Shadow Copy - unclear and/or misleading errors\" (#62148)"},{"Id":"3098325747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-28T19:15:54","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"62146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Label all maestro PRs w/ area-infrastructure","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request includes a small change to the `.github/policies/resourceManagement.yml` file.

Please describe the problem.\n\nIn ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, however, there is currently no built-in support for setting `Cache-Control` headers declaratively—unlike what exists in MVC via [ResponseCache] or [OutputCache].\n\nThis gap forces developers to manually set cache headers in each endpoint, which is repetitive, error-prone, and inconsistent.\n\n\n### Use Case A — Private caching (only client)\n**Endpoint**: GET `/api/user/ownProfile`\n\nIn this case, the response contains user-specific data. The ideal behavior is to cache the response only on the client side, not on intermediate proxies. **Server-side caching is optional but not required.**\n\nDesired header (example):\n```\nCache-Control: private, max-age=60\n```\n\n\n### Use Case B — Shared caching (client + reverse proxy)\n**Endpoint**: GET `/api/user/publicDepartments`\n\nThis endpoint returns public, infrequently changing data. It should be cached both by clients and reverse proxies.\n\nDesired header (example):\n```\nCache-Control: public, max-age=300\n```\n\n\nAt the moment, there's no unified way to describe and apply this caching policy declaratively in Minimal APIs. Developers are forced to do things like:\n```\napp.MapGet(\"/api/user/publicDepartments\", () =>\n{\n    context.Response.Headers[\"Cache-Control\"] = \"public,max-age=300\";\n    return Results.Ok(...);\n});\n```\n\nThere are also custom solutions proposed by other community members. Some of them include custom filters, others implement their own OutputCachePolicy and etc. `But they do not provide a robust implementation, which can lead to major security issues in applications.`\n\nThis topic was partially discussed [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/56769#issuecomment-2272336761) and [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49130).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIntroduce a builder-based extension for Minimal APIs to declaratively configure HTTP response caching behavior, focusing solely on HTTP-compliant cache directives such as Cache-Control, Vary, ETag, and Last-Modified.\n\nKey Goals\n\n- Fluent API design allows for flexibility in configuration, unlike the old implementation with the ResponseCache attribute. This allow combining multiple directives in a fluent and composable way.\n- Support [HTTP Caching RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9111)\n- No server-side response caching or storage (unlike OutputCache)\n\nProposal:\n```\napp.MapGet(\"/api/user/publicDepartments\", () => ...)\n   .WithCacheControl(policy => policy\n       .Public()\n       .MaxAge(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))\n       .VaryByHeader(\"Accept-Encoding\")\n   );\n\napp.MapGet(\"/api/user/ownProfile\", () => ...)\n   .WithCacheControl(policy => policy\n       .Private()\n       .MaxAge(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60))\n       .NoTransform()\n   );\n\napp.MapGet(\"/api/data/download\", () => ...)\n   .WithCacheControl(policy => policy\n       .Public()\n       .Immutable()\n       .MaxAge(TimeSpan.FromDays(30))\n   );\n```\n\n**Rationale for Additional Features (example)**\n\n`NoTransform`: Prevents proxies from modifying images, videos, or text.\n`Immutable`: Allows aggressive client-side caching when content is versioned (e.g., fingerprinted URLs).\n`SharedMaxAge`: Important when intermediaries (e.g., CDNs) should cache differently than browsers.\n`MustRevalidate`: Helps enforce strict revalidation when freshness expires.\n\nIn my opinion, the topic of dividing the cache into an external one based on headers and an internal one based on internal storage requires very careful consideration.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62143","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add ResponseCache (CacheControl) to Minimal Api\" (#62143)"},{"Id":"3097461526","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-28T13:48:33","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"62142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Visual studio update 17.14.0 i get an MSB4018 DiscoverPrecompreedAssets error","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-studio-update-17140-i-get-an-MS/10903913)._\n\n---\nAfter updating to 17.14.0 i get this error\n\nThe “DiscoverPrecompressedAssets” task failed unexpectedly.  \nSystem.InvalidOperationException: File length for ‘C:\\\\Users\\\\U379141\\\\source\\\\repos\\\\ModularConnectivityController\\\\Source\\\\Mcc.Web\\\\obj\\\\dist\\_content\\\\i18ntext\\\\Mcc.Web.I18nText.AssemblyFunctionTable.AssemblyFunctionTable.dk.json’ is not defined.  \nat Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticWebAssets.Tasks.StaticWebAsset.Validate()  \nat Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticWebAssets.Tasks.StaticWebAsset.FromTaskItem(ITaskItem item)  \nat System.Linq.Enumerable.WhereSelectArrayIterator`2.MoveNext() at System.Linq.Buffer`1…ctor(IEnumerable`1 source) at System.Linq.Enumerable.ToArray[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source)  \nat Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticWebAssets.Tasks.DiscoverPrecompressedAssets.Execute()  \nat Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskExecutionHost.Execute()  \nat Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskBuilder.&lt;ExecuteInstantiatedTask&gt;d\\_\\_26.MoveNext()\n\nNothing code vise has changed only thing i did is to update to 17.14.0 form 17.13.6 (where there were no issues)\n\nSo now i cant even compile my code\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Ricardo Yánez on 5/14/2025, 06:03 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Peter Hymøller on 5/15/2025, 06:33 AM: \n\n<p>I have found this on the Dotnet aspcore github where others are having the same issue</p>\n<p><a target='_blank' href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59625#issuecomment-2878592085\">https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59625#issuecomment-2878592085</a></p>\n<p>it seams that i can be fix by reverting back to SDK 9.0.204 and then keeping Visual Studio on 17.14.0</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/15/2025, 08:03 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

Specifically, includes added after an exclude do not override the exclude, resulting in unexpected or undesired results.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe API should evaluate include/exclude paths in order.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```sh\n$ dotnet new webapi -o webapi1\n$ cd webapi1\n```\nReplace Program.cs with:\n\n```c#\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers;\n\nvar globBuilder = new GlobbingUrlBuilder(\n    fileProvider: new PhysicalFileProvider(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), \"wwwroot\")),\n    cache: new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions()),\n    requestPathBase: \"/\"\n);\n\nvar urls = globBuilder.BuildUrlList(\n    staticUrl: null,\n    includePattern: \"**/*\",\n    excludePattern: \"ExcludeMe/**/*\"\n);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Matched URLs:\");\nforeach (var url in urls)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(url);\n}\n```\nmake wwwroot structure:\n```sh\n$ mkdir -p wwwroot/ExcludeMe/ButActuallyIncludeMe\n$ echo 'Hello' > wwwroot/helloWorld.txt\n$ echo 'Do not show me' > wwwroot/ExcludeMe/notIncluded.txt\n$ echo 'Include me!' > wwwroot/ExcludeMe/ButActuallyIncludeMe/hiEarth.txt\n```\nrun:\n```sh\n$ dotnet run\n...\nMatched URLs:\n/helloWorld.txt\n```\n\nNote, it is missing `ExcludeMe/ButActuallyIncludeMe/hiEarth.txt`\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.203\n\n### Anything else?\n\nOnce this API is available https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/109408#issuecomment-2715409854, change\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/e849f2052624e7fe981c1ab158414014d2339b23/src/Mvc/Mvc.TagHelpers/src/GlobbingUrlBuilder.cs#L127\n\n```diff\n-        var matcher = MatcherBuilder != null ?

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This mismatch caused valid XML comments to be silently dropped during the merge process.\n\n## Problem\n\n1. **In-memory compilation**: `DocumentationCommentId.CreateDeclarationId(method)` returns IDs with return type suffixes:\n   ```\n   M:Api.ProjectBoardApis.DeleteProjectBoard(System.Int32)~System.Threading.Tasks.Task\n   ```\n\n2. **XML files**: Referenced assemblies contain compiler-style IDs without return type suffixes:\n   ```xml\n   <member name=\"M:Api.ProjectBoardApis.DeleteProjectBoard(System.Int32)\">\n   ```\n\n3. **Merge failure**: `DocumentationCommentId.GetFirstSymbolForDeclarationId(name, compilation)` fails to find symbols when the key includes the return type suffix, causing comments to be discarded.\n\n## Solution\n\nImplemented a `NormalizeDocId` helper method that:\n- Strips return type suffixes (`~ReturnType`) from ordinary method documentation IDs\n- Preserves return type suffixes for conversion operators (`op_Implicit`/`op_Explicit`)\n- Normalizes both collection-phase and runtime lookup keys to the compiler-style format\n\n## Changes\n\n- **Parser**: Updated `ParseXmlFile` and `ParseCompilation` to normalize documentation IDs during collection\n- **Emitter**: Added `NormalizeDocId` method to generated code and updated transformers to use normalized lookup keys\n- **Tests**: Added comprehensive unit tests for normalization logic and integration tests for cross-assembly XML comment merging\n\n## Example\n\nBefore the fix, XML comments from referenced assemblies were ignored:\n```csharp\n// Referenced assembly XML: M:TestApi.Method(System.Int32)\n// In-memory lookup:        M:TestApi.Method(System.Int32)~System.Threading.Tasks.Task\n// Result: No match, comment dropped\n```\n\nAfter the fix, both are normalized to the same format:\n```csharp\n// Normalized cache key:    M:TestApi.Method(System.Int32)\n// Normalized lookup key:   M:TestApi.Method(System.Int32)  \n// Result: Match found, comment applied\n```\n\nAll existing tests pass, confirming the fix doesn't break any existing functionality while resolving the XML comment merge issue.\n\nFixes #62691.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

Because the keys don’t match, valid comments are silently dropped and never reach the `XmlCommentCache` that the generator emits.\n\n### Current behavior\n\n1. In-memory ID generation\n\n```csharp\n// src/OpenApi/gen/XmlCommentGenerator.Parser.cs\nif (DocumentationCommentId.CreateDeclarationId(method) is string name)\n{\n    comments.Add((name, xml));\n}\n```\n\nWhen the method symbol comes from the current compilation, Roslyn’s\n`CreateDeclarationId` returns an ID that can include the return type, e.g.\n\n```\nM:Api.ProjectBoardApis.DeleteProjectBoard(System.Int32)~System.Threading.Tasks.Task\n```\n\n2.\tXML file IDs\n\nThe same member in a referenced XML file is emitted by the C# compiler\nwithout the return-type suffix:\n\n```\n<member name=\"M:Api.ProjectBoardApis.DeleteProjectBoard(System.Int32)\">\n```\n\n3. Merge step\n\n```\nif (DocumentationCommentId.GetFirstSymbolForDeclarationId(name, compilation) is ISymbol symbol)\n{\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nWhen `name` is missing the `~returnType` suffix the lookup fails, so the\ncomment is discarded. The generated cache therefore contains entries for the in-memory ID only.\nDown-stream tooling that expects the compiler-style ID (the one in the XML\nfile) can no longer resolve the comment.\n\n### Desired behaviour\n\nBoth the IDs we emit and the IDs we use to query should match. `DocumentationCommentId.GetFirstSymbolForDeclarationId` should be in the\ncanonical compiler format (the same text that appears in the <member>\nelement of an XML doc file).\n\n### Proposed fix\n\n| Area                      | Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Parser – collection phase | Before calling `comments.Add((name, xml))` normalise `name` with a new helper `NormalizeDocId(string)` that strips the `~ReturnType` suffix for ordinary methods (retain it for `op_Implicit` / `op_Explicit`).                                            |\n| Parser – merge phase      | Apply the same `NormalizeDocId` to the key read from the XML file before the lookup.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Emitter                   | The `XmlCommentCache` keys are whatever the parser produces. After normalisation they will exactly match the XML compiler output, so no change is needed here—the existing generator already writes whatever keys it receives.                             |\n| Tests                     | Add a unit test that passes an XML file containing a member like`M:Sample.Namespace.MyApi(System.Int32)`and a source file that defines`Task MyApi(int id)`.The test should assert that the cache contains one merged entry keyed by the compiler-style ID. |\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62691","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unify handling of documentation IDs in OpenAPI XML comment generator\" (#62691)"},{"Id":"3224402150","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-11T22:49:08","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"62690","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add AppContext switch in patch release to opt-out of breaking behavior change in ForwardedHeaders middleware","State":"open","Body":"# Add AppContext switch in patch release to opt-out of breaking behavior change in ForwardedHeaders middleware.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWe previously fixed a bug where `KnownProxies` and `KnownNetworks` weren't being applied in common cases.

project names with spaces","State":"open","Body":"This PR extends the fix from #62675 (Blazor scoped CSS space handling) to MVC and Razor Pages templates, ensuring that projects with spaces in their names have correctly functioning scoped CSS.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen creating MVC or Razor Pages projects with spaces in their names (e.g., \"My Web App\"), the scoped CSS bundle reference breaks because the hardcoded `Company.WebApplication1.styles.css` reference doesn't match the actual generated bundle name, which sanitizes spaces to underscores.\n\n## Solution\n\nApplied the same `StyleBundleName` generator pattern used in the Blazor fix:\n\n1. **Added StyleBundleName generator** to both template.json files that uses regex to replace spaces with underscores:\n   ```json\n   \"StyleBundleName\":{\n     \"type\": \"generated\",\n     \"generator\": \"regex\",\n     \"replaces\": \"StyleBundleName\",\n     \"parameters\": {\n       \"source\": \"name\",\n       \"steps\": [\n         {\n           \"regex\": \" \",\n           \"replacement\": \"_\"\n         }]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Updated _Layout.cshtml files** to use the dynamic StyleBundleName:\n   ```html\n   <!-- Before -->\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"~/Company.WebApplication1.styles.css\" asp-append-version=\"true\" />\n   \n   <!-- After -->\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"~/StyleBundleName.styles.css\" asp-append-version=\"true\" />\n   ```\n\n## Testing\n\n- ✅ Template JSON validation passes\n- ✅ Integration tests verify correct CSS references for projects with spaces\n- ✅ Edge cases tested (multiple spaces, leading/trailing spaces, etc.)\n- ✅ Build system compiles templates successfully\n\n## Example\n\nFor a project named \"My Web App\":\n- Old: References `Company.WebApplication1.styles.css` (broken)\n- New: References `My_Web_App.styles.css` (works correctly)\n\nThis ensures that scoped CSS styling works consistently regardless of whether the project name contains spaces.\n\nFixes #62679.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

I understand the guidance is to style the empty rows with CSS, but doing so makes it difficult for users to change the behavior on a per instance basis, and is not always what the user wants.  Sometimes they may want the table filled out to equal height, other times they may not.  Imagine you have a per page option with a high value like 50 or 100.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nNote: In cloud environments, the proxy IP(s) can change over the lifetime of the app and `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` is sometimes used to make forwarded headers work.\n\n### References\n\n- [Forwarded Headers Middleware documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer)\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n`UseForwardedHeaders();`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/517","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Forwarded Headers Middleware Now Ignores X-Forwarded-* Headers from Unknown Proxies\" (#517)"},{"Id":"2662868601","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T18:59:39","Actor":"maraf","Number":"516","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nIn previous versions of Blazor WebAssembly, legacy Mono and Emscripten APIs were exported to global namespace. \r\nFrom 9.0 those APIs are accessible throught Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 9 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nLegacy Mono (MONO, BINDING) and Emscripten Module object was exported to global window object.\r\nFor example `window.Module.FS` returned emscripten virtual filesystem.\n\n### New behavior\n\nEmscripten Module object is now exported to `Blazor.runtime` object.\r\nFor example `Blazor.runtime.Module.FS` returns emscripten virtual filesystem.\r\nLegacy Mono API for interop was removed completely (MONO and BINDING) and replaced with JSImport/JSExport.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe general goal is not to polute global namespace and keep all the APIs accessible from single Blazor object.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nReplace accessing Emscripten APIs from window object to Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nwindow.MONO.*\r\nwindow.BINDING.*\r\nwindow.Module.*","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/516","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications\" (#516)"},{"Id":"2606573022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-22T21:39:01","Actor":"amcasey","Number":"515","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: dev cert export no longer creates folder","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nWhen you export the ASP.NET Core development certificate (used to enable https in local development), it will no longer create the directory into which the certificate is being exported, if that directory doesn’t already exist.\r\n\r\nThis change first appears in 8.0.10 and 9.0 RC1.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 8 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```\r\ndotnet dev-certs https -ep C:\\NonExistent\\cert.pfx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `C:\\NonExistent\\` did not exist when the command was run, it would be created (with permissions inherited from the containing directory).\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe target directory must exist or the export will fail with a message like `There was an error exporting the HTTPS developer certificate to a file.`\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe development certificate is exported with its private key, so unauthorized access can be very problematic.

bug\r\n\r\nAfter upgraded to .NET 8.0.200, it demands me to add RazorRuntimeCompilation otherwise the application crashes because it cannot locate the MVC view.\r\n\r\nI generated a dynamic controller assembly by Roslyn. This assembly doesn't have location because I loaded it from bytes right after generation, also it doesn't have IsDynamic=true. \r\n\r\nThen, I created an ASP.NET Core MVC application (.NET 6, 7, 8), added RazorRuntimeCompilation and added the generated assembly as AssemblyPart.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT. These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

Unfortunately, from my testing it appears it does not matter what writer is used the memory allocation made by the renderer itself is significant. It seems that the HTML is not rendered on the fly directly to the stream, instead the whole thing is built and stored into memory and when it's ready then it's serialized into HTML string. Can you confirm this is what really happens?\n\nIf that's the case, have you considered supporting this kind of scenarios in the future?

This makes it **impossible to pre-register a redirect URI** for login flows, which are required to match exactly by identity providers.\n\n---\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nI expect to be able to:\n\n* Debug my Blazor WebAssembly app normally\n* Use OpenID Connect login\n* Register a known, stable redirect URI in the identity provider (e.g., `https://localhost:5005/authentication/callback`)\n\n---\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\nBlazor WASM debugging launches the app on a random port with each run, like:\n\n```\nhttps://localhost:51783/\n```\n\nThis breaks the OpenID Connect flow because:\n\n* The identity provider requires a *static*, pre-registered `redirect_uri`\n* The app’s real port is not known until the browser opens\n\nAs a result, login fails with `invalid_redirect_uri` or requires unsafe workarounds like wildcard redirects (which most providers disallow or OpenIddict refuses to match).\n\n---\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n* Secure login flows (e.g., using OpenIddict, Duende, Auth0) require strict redirect URI matching\n* Random ports make reliable debugging impossible\n* There is no current way to *fix the debug port* for Blazor WASM apps in Visual Studio\n\n---\n\n**Workarounds attempted:**\n\n* Tried to use `launchSettings.json` to fix the port → ignored by Visual Studio for Blazor WASM\n* Tried dynamic redirect URI patching → doesn't help since identity provider also requires known `redirect_uri`\n* Tried `IHttpContextAccessor` or `OpenIddictClientService` tricks → adds too much complexity\n\n---\n\n**Repro steps:**\n\n1. Create a Blazor WASM project with OpenId Connect login (using OpenIddict or any OIDC provider)\n2. Launch in debug mode (F5)\n3. Observe that the app uses a random port\n4. Attempt login — you'll see a failure due to `redirect_uri` mismatch\n\n---\n\n**Suggestion:**\n\nPlease allow Blazor WebAssembly apps to:\n\n* Set a fixed HTTPS port (via `launchSettings.json` or Aspire config)\n* Or reuse the same debug port across runs\n* Or expose the actual launch port to the app before startup\n\n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/9/2025, 05:17 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

`KeyRingProvider` uses an expired key with `AutoGenerateKeys = false`, it schedules the next refresh for up to 24 hours in the future: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/0230498dfccaef6f782a5e37c60ea505081b72bf/src/DataProtection/DataProtection/src/KeyManagement/KeyRingProvider.cs#L187-L198\n\nThis creates a problem in multi-application scenarios where:\n1. App A generates keys\n2. App B has `AutoGenerateKeys = false` and relies on App A for new keys, but starts few minutes earlier than App A\n3. When App B's key expires, it waits up to 24h before checking for new keys from App A\n\nSince App B explicitly disabled auto-generation, it depends on other apps for new keys and should check for them more frequently when using expired keys (e.g., every 5 minutes).\n\n**Suggested fix:**\nUse a shorter refresh period when `defaultKey.ExpirationDate <= now && !_keyManagementOptions.AutoGenerateKeys`\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61930","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"KeyRingProvider uses 24h refresh period even with expired keys and disabled key auto-generation\" (#61930)"},{"Id":"3061603549","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-14T02:03:04","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"61929","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"open","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

For example, \"foobar\" will be treated as the default scheme in the code below.\r\n```\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddOAuth(\"foobar\");\r\n```\r\nThis change might expose unintended behavior changes in applications, such as authentication options being validated earlier than expected.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n.NET 7 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously, when users did not provide a default scheme in the `AddAuthentication` call, no default scheme was set.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis impacted the behavior of authentication handlers in the application layer.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nMoving forward, if (and only if) a _single_ scheme is registered in an application, that scheme will be treated as the default. In the code below, the `CookieDefaults.AuthenticationScheme` will be treated as the default scheme.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the code snippet below, no default will be set because multiple schemes are registered.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie().AddJwtBearer();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nTo reduce boilerplate when configuring authentication and set up sensible defaults.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe change only impacts applications with a single scheme registered. For those scenarios, it's recommended to ensure that your application is prepared to handle the assumption that a single scheme is the default. For example, the options associated with that scheme should be configured correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.SuppressAutoDefaultScheme` app context flag.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Changes in default authentication scheme handling for ASP.NET Core\" (#490)"},{"Id":"1287742787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T18:44:22","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"488","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs detailed in dotnet/aspnetcore#42413, the file-serving middleware (`DefaultFilesMiddleware`, `DirectoryBrowserMiddleware`, and `StaticFileMiddleware`) have been updated to no longer no-op (i.e. defer to the next middleware in the pipeline) in the case that there is an active endpoint with a `null` request delegate.\r\n\r\nPR that makes the change: dotnet/aspnetcore#42458\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nPreviously, if the current request had an active endpoint, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint() != null`, the file-serving middleware would perform no action and simply delegate to the next middleware in the request pipeline.\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe file-serving middleware will now only perform no action if there is an active endpoint and its `RequestDelegate` property value is not `null`, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint()?.RequestDelegate is not null`.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThis change will enable endpoints to be active in the request for the purposes of setting and sharing metadata with middleware that are endpoint-aware so that they can perform their intended function, while allowing other middleware (like the file-serving middleware) that would usually defer their behavior when an endpoint is active to also function.\r\n\r\nFor example, an endpoint with a `null` request delegate containing authorization metadata can be set as the active endpoint for a request, causing the `AuthorizationMiddleware` to enforce authorization requirements, which if satisfied would allow the `StaticFileMiddleware` to serve the requested files.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you are relying on setting an active endpoint on the request to suppress the behavior of the file-serving middleware, ensure that the endpoint has a non-null value set for its `RequestDelegate` property.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseStaticFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDefaultFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDirectoryBrowser()`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active\" (#488)"},{"Id":"1278667050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T16:03:03","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"487","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Unit testing SignalR Hubs may need updating","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`IHubClients` and `IHubCallerClients` now hide interface members `IClientProxy Client(string connectionId);` and `IClientProxy Caller { get;

It's effectively an alias for `localhost`, allowing for infinite variations on the host name while maintaining the benefits of the localhost address. An ASP.NET Core application started with an `ASPNETCORE_URLS` config value (or `\"applicationUrl\"` in *launchSettings.json*) will be resolvable on any address that binds to the loopback address, so a value of `http://myapp.localhost:12345` will also be resolvable via `http://localhost:12345`. Note that non-browser scenarios should continue to use the plain localhost address as they rely on regular DNS configuration to resolve a `.localhost` TLD address to the loopback address.\r\n\r\nThe empty and blazor web templates have been updated with a new option, `--localhost-tld`, that can be specified to opt the new project into using the `.localhost` TLD for the application URL. The other templates focusing on non-browser scenarios or using parts of ASP.NET Core not considered our primary, modern, recommended approach, have not been updated but users are free to manually change their launch profiles to use the `.localhost` TLD.\r\n\r\nKestrel itself was updated to treat `.localhost` addresses the same as the `localhost` address. In the case a `.localhost` address is being used, Kestrel will print out that it's listening on both the `.localhost` address, and regular `localhost` without the sub-domain prefix too so it's obvious that both are resolvable, e.g.:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74f0f899-32f8-4ef0-9efd-2ef9cd15c274)\r\n\r\nThe developer certificate logic had the certificate version incremented, and was updated to include new SANs for the following addresses:\r\n\r\n- `*.localhost`\r\n- `*.internal`\r\n\r\nFixes #62592\r\n\r\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e452dc1-37bd-4faa-8426-66c329d38780\" />\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77006c8e-a619-498a-b0f9-bd45ab2c60e1)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62593","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Support *.localhost TLD for local dev\" (#62593)"},{"Id":"3213822324","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-08T21:31:21","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"62616","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0-preview6] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"open","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

disable rendering of filler rows.  It keeps the default functionality of rendering the filler rows.  I understand that one way to deal with this is to style it with CSS, but in some cases that's impractical, overly complex, and desirable.  This provides users the ability to choose how they want it to behave without being forced to use CSS which prevents them from changing from one method to another on a per instance basis.

AddUpdateSortByColumnAsync can be called by columns to append or change the sort direction of an existing sorted column.  For EF implementations multi column sorting is handled automatically.  The existing SortByColumnAsync method clears all other columns and simply flips the direction of the column that was clicked.  This enables users to, for example, specify ctrl+click appends the column and a normal click clears other columns and allows for things like ColumnOptions to be used so the default single column sorting functionality is maintained, but the underlying capability is now included in the box to support multiple column sorting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR exposes the SortColumns so individual columns can easily apply this logic and benefit from additional functionality like making it trivial to swap an icon out based on it's current sort state independent of the aria tags on the tr itself since that's much more difficult to get at in those cases.\r\n\r\nFixes #62494 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62604","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"QuickGrid: Adds Multi Column Sorting\" (#62604)"},{"Id":"3213037058","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-08T15:54:29","Actor":"los93sol","Number":"62603","RawContent":null,"Title":"QuickGrid: Adds EmptyContentTemplate","State":"open","Body":"# QuickGrid: Adds EmptyContentTemplate\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an EmptyContentTemplate component to QuickGrid.

When nullable properties are used in expressions that undergo implicit conversions (such as `DateTime?` to `object`), C# generates a `UnaryExpression` wrapping the `MemberExpression`.\n\n## Example of the issue:\n\n```csharp\npublic class TestEntity\n{\n    [Display(Name = \"Tidspunkt\")]\n    public DateTime?

I had to resort to reflection to call the internal `WebApplicationBuilder` constructor.\n\nThe public `configureDefaults` action could also be useful in production.\n\n## Proposed API\n\nPlease add the following methods to the `WebApplication` class.\n\n```\npublic static WebApplicationBuilder CreateBuilder(WebApplicationOptions options, Action<IHostBuilder>? configureDefaults) =>\n        new(options, configureDefaults);\npublic static WebApplicationBuilder CreateSlimBuilder(WebApplicationOptions options, Action<IHostBuilder>? configureDefaults) =>\n        new(options, slim: true, configureDefaults);\npublic static WebApplicationBuilder CreateEmptyBuilder(WebApplicationOptions options, Action<IHostBuilder>? configureDefaults) =>\n        new(options, slim: false, empty: true, configureDefaults);\n\n```\n\nThat's all what's needed.\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nThere is no alternative.\n\n## Risks\n\nThere is no risk.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62594","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebApplication.CreateBuilder() should allow a configure action parameter for testing purposes\" (#62594)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy. Or authentication to fail if using TLS termination and expecting an https request.\n\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe change was made for security hardening, as the proxy and IP lists weren't being applied in all cases.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n- **Review your deployment topology:**  \n  Ensure that all legitimate proxy servers in front of your app are properly added to `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` in your `ForwardedHeadersOptions` configuration.\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownProxies = { IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_PROXY_IP\") }\n  });\n  ```\n  Or, for a network:\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownNetworks = { new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_NETWORK_IP\"), PREFIX_LENGTH) }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **If you wish to enable previous behavior:**  \n  You may need to relax your configuration, but this is **not recommended** due to security risks. You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nNote: In cloud environments, the proxy IP(s) can change over the lifetime of the app and `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` is sometimes used to make forwarded headers work.\n\n### References\n\n- [Forwarded Headers Middleware documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer)\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n`UseForwardedHeaders();`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/517","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Forwarded Headers Middleware Now Ignores X-Forwarded-* Headers from Unknown Proxies\" (#517)"},{"Id":"2662868601","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T18:59:39","Actor":"maraf","Number":"516","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nIn previous versions of Blazor WebAssembly, legacy Mono and Emscripten APIs were exported to global namespace. \r\nFrom 9.0 those APIs are accessible throught Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 9 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nLegacy Mono (MONO, BINDING) and Emscripten Module object was exported to global window object.\r\nFor example `window.Module.FS` returned emscripten virtual filesystem.\n\n### New behavior\n\nEmscripten Module object is now exported to `Blazor.runtime` object.\r\nFor example `Blazor.runtime.Module.FS` returns emscripten virtual filesystem.\r\nLegacy Mono API for interop was removed completely (MONO and BINDING) and replaced with JSImport/JSExport.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe general goal is not to polute global namespace and keep all the APIs accessible from single Blazor object.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nReplace accessing Emscripten APIs from window object to Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nwindow.MONO.*\r\nwindow.BINDING.*\r\nwindow.Module.*","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/516","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications\" (#516)"},{"Id":"2606573022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-22T21:39:01","Actor":"amcasey","Number":"515","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: dev cert export no longer creates folder","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nWhen you export the ASP.NET Core development certificate (used to enable https in local development), it will no longer create the directory into which the certificate is being exported, if that directory doesn’t already exist.\r\n\r\nThis change first appears in 8.0.10 and 9.0 RC1.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 8 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```\r\ndotnet dev-certs https -ep C:\\NonExistent\\cert.pfx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `C:\\NonExistent\\` did not exist when the command was run, it would be created (with permissions inherited from the containing directory).\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe target directory must exist or the export will fail with a message like `There was an error exporting the HTTPS developer certificate to a file.`\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe development certificate is exported with its private key, so unauthorized access can be very problematic.

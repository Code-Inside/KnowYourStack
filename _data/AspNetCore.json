By making the value containers not ignore their null values, we semantically separate \"there is no value\" from \"there is a value, and it is null\": Use `Results.Ok()`/`TypedResults.Ok()` for the former, and `Results.Ok(null)`/`TypedResults.Ok(null)` for the latter.\r\n\r\n`Ok<TValue>` et al. use the same helper to handle their values, so simply changing this helper to not ignore null values solves that part of the issue.\r\n\r\n`TypedResults` has a nice hard delineation between value and no-value, but `Results` does not. As a user, I cannot create a null-valued `Results.Ok`, because the current implementation short-circuits both `Results.Ok()`, `Results.Ok(null)`, and `Results.Ok<T?>(null)` into returning the cached valueless `Ok`. This can easily be changed (as has been done in this PR), but this is a change to something that has been shipped in the public API. I would that kind of change like signed off before I continue.\r\n\r\nI have tried to follow the test style I could see to the best of my ability. In summary:\r\n- Two basic tests to ensure the `HttpResultsHelper` change works as expected\r\n- A new test ensures that a response body for an `Ok`-wrapped value is the same as the value by itself\r\n  - Naming, class placements, test organization, etc. is open for change.\r\n  - I expect the test class to be filled with more equivalence tests for the different statuses as they get implemented.\r\n- A handful of tests needed to have their expected values changed. The blast radius was surprisingly small.\r\n\r\nFixes #49107\r\n\r\n### Side Note\r\n\r\n`Ok<TValue>` et al. stores a `TValue?` property, and `Results.Ok<TValue>`/`TypedResults<TValue>` have a parameter of `TValue?`. If null is no longer used as an implicit sentinel value, could these instead be a plain `TValue`?\r\n\r\nIt would simplify the implementation of the `HttpResultsHelper` a bit, because `typeof(TValue?)` feels weird.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, it would allow the compiler to catch some user errors: Consider the handler `Ok<T> () => { T? t = null; return TypedResults.Ok(t); }` causing a type error rather than a bug hunt. This would improve my personal DevEx (I like being able to trust my types), and I imagine I'm not the only one creating a greenfield project using Minimal APIs with nullable types enabled.\r\n\r\nI can see this being a separate change, and that's fine. I just wanted to mention it, since I'm bumping against it here.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49588","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Draft: Support null values in Results/TypedResults\" (#49588)"},{"Id":"1816904556","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-22T21:45:39","Actor":"sake402","Number":"49587","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor WebAssembly misinterprets Content-Type on wasm file, uses slow ArrayBuffer instantiation","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nFor some weird unknown reason, the file server for a blazor wasm app is returning double and duplicate ``Content-Type`` on *.wasm request for a blazor wasm file.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/20999608/dd0c76ad-3365-4ae1-a77c-269fda9fe961)\r\n\r\nBut because this ``Content-Type`` is handled literarily by Blazor, it makes it fallback to slow ArrayBuffer instantiation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/20999608/3604b9cc-61c2-421f-a442-08131f7bab3e)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/20999608/7aa62c45-715b-4b0a-abe8-1cf4b0acb6fe)\r\n\r\nI would assume this double ``'application/wasm'`` is still valid as html standard allows multiple values as header value\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWebAssembly.instantiateStreaming should be used despite multiple copies of ``application/wasm`` in ``Content-Type``\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49587","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor WebAssembly misinterprets Content-Type on wasm file, uses slow ArrayBuffer instantiation\" (#49587)"},{"Id":"1816771091","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-22T13:46:22","Actor":"terryaney","Number":"49586","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update JwtBearerOptions via DI after configuration when secret or issuer changes","State":"open","Body":"Similar to [Better way to get the Json Web Key in AddJwtBearer](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21491) and [Use object in DI when AddJwtBearer](https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1709), I wanted a way to have my Jwt secret/issuer come from a configuration source that could be updated and have our sites/apis resilient enough to automatically use them if they changed without requiring a restart of each site that depended on the credentials.\r\n\r\nI wanted to follow up with this question on either of those tasks but both were closed.

This allows the render mode for a component to resolve to either \"Server\" or \"WebAssembly\" depending on whether the WebAssembly runtime is downloaded and available on the client.\r\n\r\nBackport of #49477\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn full-stack Blazor apps, components can be made interactive either via \"WebAssembly\" or \"Server\" render modes. The WebAssembly render mode has the advantage that it consumes fewer server resources, but the disadvantage that it delays \"time to interactivity\" because .NET WebAssembly runtime resources must be downloaded to the client first. Therefore, the \"auto\" render mode was introduced so that it:\r\n* Uses the WebAssembly render mode if the client already has the WebAssembly bits cached\r\n* Uses the Server render mode in other cases, while downloading WebAssembly resources in the background\r\n\r\nWe also intend to add support for customizing the policy that determines which render mode \"auto\" mode should resolve to, but that's not included as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, attempting to use the \"auto\" render mode would result in an error in the browser console and an unusable app. This PR allows customers to start experimenting with auto mode for their apps.\r\n\r\nFixes #46397\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMedium. The Auto render mode is already one of the three render modes customers can pick, but currently it just breaks the app. As we get closer to GA, we expect lots of customers to start trying out auto mode, so we'd like this feature to be made available as soon as possible so we can collect feedback and make the necessary corrections.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [ ] High\r\n- [ ] Medium\r\n- [X] Low\r\n\r\nThis feature shouldn't impact functionality for existing Blazor Server/WebAssembly apps.

And I must say that TagHelpers just don't work.\n\nI have created WebApp from VS template.\nMy simple TagHelper looks like that:\n\n```\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.TagHelpers;\n\nnamespace TagHelperTest.TagHelpers\n{\n    [HtmlTargetElement(\"pagination\")]\n    public class PaginationTagHelper : TagHelper\n    {\n        public override void Process(TagHelperContext context, TagHelperOutput output)\n        {\n            output. TagName = \"div\";\n            output. Content.SetContent(\"Hello\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI have imported it in _ViewImports.cshtml:\n\n```\n@using TagHelperTest\n@using TagHelperTest.TagHelpers\n@namespace TagHelperTest.Pages\n@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers\n@addTagHelper *, TagHelperTest\n```\n\nAnd use it in Index.cshtml:\n\n```\n@page\n@model IndexModel\n@{\n    ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"Home page\";\n}\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n    <h1 class=\"display-4\">Welcome</h1>\n    <p>Learn about <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core\">building Web apps with ASP.NET Core</a>.</p>\n\n<pagination />\n</div>\n```\n\nOutput of my TagHelper is just:\n\n```\n<div> </div>\n```\n\ninstead of:\n\n```\n<div>Hello</div>\n```\n\nWhat's more, if I don't set TagHelper name in attribute, so instead of:\n\n```\n[HtmlTargetElement(\"pagination\")]\npublic class PaginationTagHelper : TagHelper\n```\n\nI will just:\n\n```\n[HtmlTargetElement(TagStructure = TagStructure.WithoutEndTag)]\npublic class PaginationTagHelper : TagHelper\n```\n\nthen something really bad happens - all, I mean ALL html tags become somehow my tag helper. It's hard to explain. Image will be better:\n\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=B9d2a2427e57441b2ab64e41711bb4143638241567139080798_20230705-142523-image.png&tid=9d2a2427e57441b2ab64e41711bb4143638241567139080798)\n\nLook at <div>, <h1>, <p> and <a> tags - they somehow became my tag.

This includes enhanced navigations and stream rendering updates._\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the experience by:\r\n* Allowing interactive components to be added via SSR updates\r\n* Allowing enhanced navigations to occur even after interactive components exist\r\n* Persisting component instances across SSR updates\r\n  * i.e., user-entered state does not get destroyed when an SSR update occurs\r\n* Enabling an interactive component's parameters to get changed by an SSR update\r\n* Correctly disposing interactive component instances when an SSR update removes them\r\n\r\nIn summary, these changes make the boundary between SSR and interactive rendering much more seamless than it was before.\r\n\r\nFixes #48763\r\nFixes #48764\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMedium/high. Many of the issues we've run into when doing internal app building are due to the aforementioned limitations. This is a change we're anticipating will greatly increase the capabilities of apps customers can build, so it's critical we get feedback about whether the behavior of this feature meets their needs.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [ ] High\r\n- [X] Medium\r\n- [ ] Low\r\n\r\nThis is a large change that touches some fairly fundamental parts of the framework. Existing automated tests help give us reasonable confidence that existing Blazor WebAssembly and Server applications (non-SSR'd) won't be affected by this change. However, the possibility of behavioral changes in certain edge cases is non-zero.\r\nNew automated tests validate the functionality of the enhancements this PR brings.\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\n- [X] Manual (required)\r\n- [X] Automated\r\n\r\n## Packaging changes reviewed?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n- [X] N/A","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49557","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/8.0-preview7] [Blazor] Improvements to the interaction between SSR and interactive rendering\" (#49557)"},{"Id":"1815688528","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-21T15:18:52","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"49567","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:32db3699-5666-45da-a1b7-08d8b804cd75)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: 32db3699-5666-45da-a1b7-08d8b804cd75\r\n- **Build**: 20230720.7\r\n- **Date Produced**: July 21, 2023 12:50:20 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: a4a8e8e712eff30c9223ebdeeeb4c80fb798e972\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT.

These are some possible options that will keep the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return Accepted(new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status202Accepted, new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic Model Get()\r\n{\r\n   Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n   return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC/API Controller actions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/485","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ActionResult<T> set StatusCode to 200\" (#485)"},{"Id":"1149914360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T20:33:05","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"482","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\n\nStarting in .NET 7, Blazor components use [`ActivatorUtilities`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities) to instantiate components. This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

I have an ASP.NET Core 5.0 application running in Docker in Kubernetes, which handles Web Socket connections. Each instance uses about 1Gb of memory. Sometimes, load increases and we get Out of memory exceptions, a process crashes and then is restarted by Kubernetes.

The last message from instance was: \"The connection listener failed to accept any new connections\", which is logged here https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/ConnectionDispatcher.cs#L67 with a comment that describes the situation :)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI think that the process should crash like with another unhandled exceptions, because Kestrel can not accept new connections anyway\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.OutOfMemoryException: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.Internal.SocketConnection..ctor(Socket socket, MemoryPool`1 memoryPool, PipeScheduler transportScheduler, ISocketsTrace trace, Nullable`1 maxReadBufferSize, Nullable`1 maxWriteBufferSize, Boolean waitForData, Boolean useInlineSchedulers)\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketConnectionListener.AcceptAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.ConnectionDispatcher`1.<>c__DisplayClass9_0.<<StartAcceptingConnectionsCore>g__AcceptConnectionsAsync|0>d.MoveNext()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n.NET 5.0.15\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nPS.

After the body is read, it’s not rewindable (you can’t read the stream multiple times).\r\n* The `Stream`/`PipeReader` are not usable outside of the controller action handler as the underlying buffers will be disposed and/or reused.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41540","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support binding request body as Stream in Controller Actions\" (#41540)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change. Optionally, there are changes to your application that you may consider to work around this change if it impacts your application:\r\n\r\n* [`ActivatorUtilitiesConstructorAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilitiesconstructorattribute) can be applied to constructor to specify an exact constructor to use.\r\n* Application developers may register an implementation of `IComponentActivator` in the DI container that reverts to the .NET 6 behavior.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nComponent constructors","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/482","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default\" (#482)"},{"Id":"1190169916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-01T19:03:58","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"484","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThe mechanism to detect an empty request `body` during the MVC Model Binding now uses the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody), that is currently implemented by the following behavior:\r\n\r\n- `true` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with a non-zero `Content-Length` or a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that did not set the `END_STREAM` flag on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\n- `false` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with no `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header, or the `Content-Length` is `0`.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with `Connection: Upgrade` (e.g. WebSockets). There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

Path: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"value\": [\r\n      \"The value field is required.\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWith the updated detection mechanism, the deserialization will not be trigger since an empty request body will be detected and only a `validation` message will be reported back to the client. Eg.:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-0f87920dc675fdfdf8d7638d3be66577-bd6bdbf32d21b714-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"\": [\r\n+      \"A non-empty request body is required.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"value\": [\r\n      \"The value field is required.\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is an alignment with other parts of the framework that were already using the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody) and also a fix to a reported issue dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29570\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nNo change is required, however, if you getting an unexpected behavior is recommended to review if your client's requests are sending the appropriated headers/information.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC Action Controllers","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/484","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding\" (#484)"},{"Id":"1154726545","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T01:08:45","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"483","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Event IDs for some Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core log messages changed","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs part of updating the Microsoft.AspNetcore.Mvc.Core assembly to use `LoggerMessageAttribute`, we discovered logger event Ids being reused within a single log category.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

If you were previously using `app.Use` but never calling the `next` middleware, you will now get a compiler error (CS0121). If that's the case you should use `app.Run` instead of `app.Use`.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 6.0-preview4\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await next();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await SomeAsyncWork();\r\n    // next never called\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await next(context);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that you can now pass `context` to the `next` delegate.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Run(async (context) =>\r\n{\r\n    await SomeAsyncWork();\r\n    // next never called\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `app.Run` when your middleware never calls `next`, otherwise you will get a compile error:\r\n`CS0121 The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'UseExtensions.Use(IApplicationBuilder, Func<HttpContext, Func, Task>)' and 'UseExtensions.Use(IApplicationBuilder, Func<HttpContext, RequestDelegate, Task>)'`\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe previous `Use` method would allocate 2 objects per request. The new overload avoids these allocations with a small change to how you invoke the next middleware.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you get a compile error, it means you are calling `app.Use` without using the `next` delegate. Switch to `app.Run` to fix the error.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n\r\nDiscussion issue https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32020\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/461","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New Use middleware overload, can cause compiler errors if you don't call next\" (#461)"},{"Id":"853676314","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-08T17:07:48","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"460","RawContent":null,"Title":"PreserveCompilationContext is no longer configured by default","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis issue template is for use in opening issues that document breaking changes.

This is primarily used to support runtime-compilation based scenarios.\r\n\r\nPrior to .NET 6, `PreserveCompilationContext` was configured to `true` for all apps that target the Razor (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor`) and Web (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`) apps. Starting in .NET 6, this property is no longer configured by default.

Generated view types were public and under the \"AspNetCore\" namespace.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBoth views and application types are included in a single `AppName.Views.dll` assembly.

This was not possible with the older API because there was no place to store the internal event subscriptions. The new API returns an object that holds the state necessary to remove data annotations validation support on disposal.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\n**This does not affect most applications, because most applications do not call this directly anyway.** Most applications instead use the `<DataAnnotationsValidator>` component, and do not need to be changed. The use of the extension methods discussed here is a rare and advanced case.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you do call `editContext.AddDataAnnotationsValidation()`, then replace that call with `editContext.EnableDataAnnotationsValidation()`.

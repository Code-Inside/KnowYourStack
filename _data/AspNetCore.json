Please describe the problem.\n\nCurrently custom awaitables are [not supported and it is marked as a `TODO` in the code](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Http/Http.Extensions/src/RequestDelegateFactory.cs#L643-L644).  Honestly, I don't have a use for this myself, I stick with `Task` and `ValueTask` but they exist out there and it would be nice to support them.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSince a lot of [work is done on this line](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Http/Http.Extensions/src/RequestDelegateFactory.cs#L573) to test whether the type is awaitable but the `AwaitableInfo` that method can return is discarded. I propose that information is used to create a custom `Awaitable` that also implements everything required to be an awaitable [very similarly to `ObjectMethodExecutorAwaitable`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Shared/ObjectMethodExecutor/ObjectMethodExecutorAwaitable.cs). I believe there would be two versions of this. One with a void result and one non-void result. We can also utilize generics to create this object to minimize boxing. That awaitable is created using `Expression.New` and sent into a `Execute[...]` method so that we can `await` it. \r\n\r\nOne thing I propose this intentionally doesn't support is is the input delegate has a `returnType` of `System.Object`. Currently when objects have that return type it gets sent to [this method](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Http/Http.Extensions/src/RequestDelegateFactory.cs#L1496-L1544). To support custom awaitables in that method we would have to utilize a lot of reflection each and every call and that would most likely slow down all the other `Task<>` and such calls so that it would be fine not supporting this for calls that have to go through the runtime to determine how to format their output.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI have begun [working on this](https://github.com/justindbaur/aspnetcore/blob/custom-await/src/Http/Http.Extensions/src/RequestDelegateFactory.cs#L650-L737) but PR's require an issue to exist. I'm not quite ready to create a PR because I need to make sure it's fully tested but I am close.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40554","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support Custom Awaitable Types in Minimal API's\" (#40554)"},{"Id":"1160348973","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-05T13:16:14","Actor":"AndirNotes","Number":"40553","RawContent":null,"Title":"Xamarin.Mac: WebHost.RunAsync without CancellationToken fails with Unsupported platform exception","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n\r\nWebHost.RunAsync() fails with unsupported platform exception with Xamarin.Mac if no cancellation token specified.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change.

Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license.

However, a simple C# script that I wrote can reach the server over Http/3:\r\n```C#\r\nusing System.Net;\r\n\r\nvar handler = new SocketsHttpHandler();\r\nhandler.SslOptions = new System.Net.Security.SslClientAuthenticationOptions\r\n{\r\n    RemoteCertificateValidationCallback = (_, __, ___, ____) => true\r\n};\r\n\r\nHttpClient client = new HttpClient(handler);\r\nvar result = await client.SendAsync(new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, \"https://127.0.0.1:5001\")\r\n{\r\n    Version = HttpVersion.Version30,\r\n    VersionPolicy = HttpVersionPolicy.RequestVersionExact\r\n}, CancellationToken.None);\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(await result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also noticed that if I replace the existing certificate \r\n```C#\r\nvar cert = CertificateLoader.LoadFromStoreCert(\"localhost\", StoreName.My.ToString(), StoreLocation.CurrentUser, false);\r\n```\r\nwith a newly generated one (see script below), then I can connect to the server via WebTransport APIs in DevTools. The main browser still is refused though. \r\n```C#\r\nvar now = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;\r\nSubjectAlternativeNameBuilder sanBuilder = new();\r\nsanBuilder.AddDnsName(\"localhost\");\r\nusing var ec = ECDsa.Create(ECCurve.NamedCurves.nistP256);\r\nCertificateRequest req = new(\"CN=localhost\", ec, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256);\r\nreq.CertificateExtensions.Add(new X509EnhancedKeyUsageExtension(new OidCollection\r\n{\r\n    new(\"1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1\") // serverAuth\r\n}, false));\r\nreq.CertificateExtensions.Add(new X509KeyUsageExtension(X509KeyUsageFlags.DigitalSignature, false));\r\nreq.CertificateExtensions.Add(sanBuilder.Build());\r\nusing var crt = req.CreateSelfSigned(now, now.AddDays(14));\r\ncert = new(crt.Export(X509ContentType.Pfx));\r\n```\r\nThe above code snippet was taken from https://github.com/wegylexy/webtransport, which seems to have a WebTransport and http/3 server working in C#.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI should be able to fetch the `Hello, World! Http/3` via the browser. However, I always either get `Hello, World! Http/2` or the browser connection refused message.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Modify the line 43: \r\n```C#\r\noptions.ListenAnyIP(5001, listenOptions =>\r\n```\r\nTo become\r\n```C#\r\noptions.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5001, listenOptions =>\r\n```\r\n(This avoids the known bug that prevents the connection)\r\n\r\n2. Open a browser and go to `https://localhost:5001`.\r\n\r\n_You can also modify the `listenOptions.Protocols` to only include Http/3. In those cases, it always times out instead of just always defaulting to Http/2._\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 (64-bit) - Preview\r\nVersion 17.3.0 Preview 1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n**(aspnetcore) PS C:\\aspnetcore> dotnet --info**\r\n.NET SDK:\r\n Version:   7.0.100-preview.5.22228.6\r\n Commit:    f59d2cfdfe\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.22000\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\aspnetcore\\.dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.100-preview.5.22228.6\\\r\n\r\nglobal.json file:\r\n  C:\\aspnetcore\\global.json\r\n\r\nHost:\r\n  Version:      7.0.0-preview.5.22254.12\r\n  Architecture: x64\r\n  Commit:       874c6a9375\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  7.0.100-preview.5.22228.6 [C:\\aspnetcore\\.dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.0-preview.5.22228.1 [C:\\aspnetcore\\.dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.0-preview.5.22226.6 [C:\\aspnetcore\\.dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.0-preview.5.22254.12 [C:\\aspnetcore\\.dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.0-preview.5.22226.7 [C:\\aspnetcore\\.dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41762","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Default dev certificate not working with Http3\" (#41762)"},{"Id":"1242379254","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T22:06:04","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"41761","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add test for assembly versions in our packages","State":"open","Body":"Part of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/31074","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41761","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add test for assembly versions in our packages\" (#41761)"},{"Id":"1240948932","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T20:34:06","Actor":"adityamandaleeka","Number":"41745","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make RedirectRule honor specified scheme","State":"closed","Body":"Fix #41707\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/28903 introduced a behavioral change in `RedirectRule` where the scheme used in a redirected request overrides the one specified in the redirect configuration.\r\n\r\nThis fixes that so we now honor the scheme specified in the redirect if there is one.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41745","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Make RedirectRule honor specified scheme\" (#41745)"},{"Id":"1242277913","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T20:16:13","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"41760","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/6.0] Backport branch mirror pipeline","State":"open","Body":"Backport https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41715 and https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41736","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41760","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/6.0] Backport branch mirror pipeline\" (#41760)"},{"Id":"1240197740","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T19:45:12","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"41736","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow explicit manual runs of mirror pipeline","State":"closed","Body":"In case we ever need to trigger this manually, surface a checkbox to the user.

Please describe the problem.\n\nI'm working on a server-side Blazor project. I use many components (.razor files) with their corresponding css isoltation (.razor.css) files. I noticed a bug where the first css-class \".my-class {color: blue;}\" of one specific component's isolated css file (B.razor.css) was not displayed. I noticed renaming the component and its .css file did change/move/disable the bug. Cause was, that A.razor.css had one too many \"}\" at the end of the file. Thus, after the compiler combined all isolated css files, ofc the following class after the bad \"}\" did not work correctly (meaning the browser did not show the color, just as if .my-class was not existing). It took me hours to find, because the cause (the \"}\" ) was in A.razor.css but the effect was seen in B.razor.css, so naturally I looked at B.razor.css for hours. If I renamed B.razor.css (and its comp) to D.razor.css (and its comp) then the first class of C.razor.css was not working.\r\n\r\nThese are example names, actually my class was named differently, and starting with letter S, but I noticed it worked if I renamed it to anything not starting with S. That was very confusing.\r\n\r\nI hope you understand the issue.\r\nIf it's not clear enough, please add a comment, then I will try to provide more information and data.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nPlease add a compiler warning, so that VS will notify me if the syntax of my .css files is incorrect. So a faulty css file would be found much quicker. Especially, since the framework will combine all of the .razor.css files into once single css file, it should actually check if each .razor.css file on its own is syntactically correct, so that no one file can influence/corrupt the behavior of another.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41751","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"css isolation compiler warnings for incorrect css syntax\" (#41751)"},{"Id":"1241154401","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T04:32:54","Actor":"SuperCatss","Number":"41749","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis never connect error","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI provided the wrong connection string, but no connection error\r\nWhen I call Set or Get , it waits infinitely\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPrompt connection error\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.202\n\n### Anything else?\n\n.NET SDK (反映任何 global.json):\r\n Version:   6.0.202\r\n Commit:    f8a55617d2\r\n\r\n运行时环境:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.19042\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.202\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 6.0.4\r\n  Commit:  be98e88c76\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  6.0.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41749","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis never connect error\" (#41749)"},{"Id":"1240602077","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T04:12:54","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"41743","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:8ce5251e-8269-419d-3b2a-08d8b8050dda)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/efcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 8ce5251e-8269-419d-3b2a-08d8b8050dda\r\n- **Build**: 20220518.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: May 19, 2022 1:45:19 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: d69ba3c9d5e59ed55c966918a8538682000aba4d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**: [from 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.2 to 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.5][3]\r\n  - **dotnet-ef**: [from 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.2 to 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.5][3]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore**: [from 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.2 to 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.5][3]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer**: [from 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.2 to 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.5][3]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory**: [from 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.2 to 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.5][3]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational**: [from 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.2 to 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.5][3]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite**: [from 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.2 to 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.5][3]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design**: [from 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.2 to 7.0.0-preview.5.22268.5][3]\r\n\r\n[3]: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/compare/5a759d5...d69ba3c\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:8ce5251e-8269-419d-3b2a-08d8b8050dda)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41743","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore\" (#41743)"},{"Id":"1241053757","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T02:44:55","Actor":"v-milindm","Number":"41748","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor NullReferenceException at AuthorizeViewCore.OnParametersSetAsync() in Published App but runs fine locally","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHello Team,\r\n\r\nWe have a web application for MSFT internal tenant.

All JS files are co-located with .razor, .cs and .css files and the corresponding JS modules are imported when a component is first initialized using the following statement;\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nJSRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(\"import\", $\"./_content/{assemblyName}/{componentName}.js\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29497049/169188415-912695d6-e6ff-4e95-b875-2062d686ef8c.png)\r\n\r\nThis works great, but I did notice when running my app on a mobile device and a very slow network that loading of a module may fail. This is a problem since failure to load JS code is a catastrophic event - some of the more complex components orchestrate communication between other simpler components etc. so I need to have a guarantee that when accessing a particular app page, all components on the page will be successfully initialized. Things like failure to load some data on the page using web api is being properly handled, but I don't see an elegant way how to handle a failure to load a JS module.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to achieve is to somehow bundle all JS modules into a single file that will be loaded when the application first initializes. How can I do this without rewriting any of my existing code? I love how JS colocation provides clean separation of concerns. All combined, my JS files are only about 30K uncompressed.\r\n\r\nAlso, provided that there is a solution to bundle all JS files, I'd like to minimize/obfuscate them as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a completely different approach (error boundaries) that I need to look at?\r\n\r\nThank you @javiercn for your help!\r\n\r\nDaniel\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41746","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bundling JS modules\" (#41746)"},{"Id":"1240204288","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T01:01:52","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"41737","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add IServerDelegationFeature to DI ","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #40043\r\n\r\nIServerDelegationFeature is useful to consume as a service but right now it can only be retrieved indirectly like this:\r\n`services.GetRequiredService<IServer>().Features.Get<IServerDelegationFeature>()`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41737","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add IServerDelegationFeature to DI \" (#41737)"},{"Id":"1240555386","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-18T23:23:10","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"41741","RawContent":null,"Title":"Quarantine a couple IIS tests","State":"closed","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40628","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/41741","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Quarantine a couple IIS tests\" (#41741)"},{"Id":"1240511063","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-18T22:53:39","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"41740","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use Array.Empty for parameterless filters","State":"closed","Body":"Closes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41705\r\n\r\n**Validation**\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Look ma!

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

This experience is going to focus on decoupling the frontend from the backend into two separate projects. For details here.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

Optionally, captured the new returned `IDisposable` and dispose it if you later wish to undo the effects of the call.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.AddDataAnnotationsValidation(EditContext)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.forms.editcontextdataannotationsextensions.adddataannotationsvalidation?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/458","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation\" (#458)"},{"Id":"848690041","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T18:24:35","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"457","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Java Client updated to RxJava3","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis issue template is for use in opening issues that document breaking changes.

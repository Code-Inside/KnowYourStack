Stream A blocks waiting to write, preventing Stream B from receiving acknowledgments, which blocks Stream A's reader.\n\n**Solution:** Implement non-blocking backpressure detection on the .NET side and exponential backoff retry on the JS side.\n\n### Changes\n\n**C# (RemoteJSDataStream, ComponentHub, CircuitHost):**\n- Added `JSDataStreamStatus` enum: `Success` | `Backpressure` | `StreamDead`\n- Check `PipeWriter.UnflushedBytes` before writing; return `Backpressure` immediately if threshold (96KB) exceeded\n- Configure `Pipe` with explicit thresholds (128KB pause, 64KB resume) for predictable behavior\n- Change return type from `bool` to `JSDataStreamStatus` throughout the call chain\n\n**TypeScript (CircuitStreamingInterop):**\n- Handle `Backpressure` status with exponential backoff (100ms → 10s max)\n- Only detect backpressure on `invoke()` calls (which wait for response), not `send()` calls (fire-and-forget)\n- Retry same chunk with preserved `chunkId` until success or stream death\n\n**Tests:**\n- Updated all 18 existing tests to use new status enum\n- Added test verifying status enum plumbing\n- All 348 Component Server tests pass\n\nThe backpressure check occurs after chunk validation but before state updates, ensuring clean retries without duplicate data or state corruption.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> ## Problem\n> \n> When uploading multiple files simultaneously in a Blazor Server app using the `InputFile` component, the process hangs when the total file size exceeds approximately 1MB (e.g., uploading 3+ files of 2MB or more each). The request never reaches the API controller.\n> \n> This issue is tracked in: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47301\n> \n> ## Root Cause\n> \n> As analyzed by @SteveSandersonMS in [this comment](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47301#issuecomment-1520676385):\n> \n> The backpressure mechanism uses a `Pipe`, with the JS side sending calls that write to it, and the .NET side doing stream operations that read from it. The problem occurs in this sequence:\n> \n> 1. JS supplies content for streams A and B, trying to supply content for both so .NET could read them in parallel\n> 2. However, in the `HttpRequestMessage` case, .NET wants to read *all* of stream A before starting stream B\n> 3. At some point, the pipe for stream B fills up, so the next write for stream B will asynchronously pause\n> 4. Unfortunately, SignalR only allows a single concurrent call per circuit by default (`MaximumParallelInvocationsPerClient = 1`)\n> 5. Because the write call for stream B is blocked, no more writes for stream A can be received\n> 6. Eventually the reader for stream A runs out of data and pauses, waiting for more writes that will never come\n> \n> ## Solution (per @SteveSandersonMS)\n> \n> Change the backpressure mechanism so that:\n> \n> 1. **On the .NET side (`RemoteJSDataStream.cs`)**: When unable to write to the pipe due to backpressure, instead of awaiting indefinitely, reject the write instantly and return a special response to the JS side indicating backpressure.\n> \n> 2. **On the JS side (`CircuitStreamingInterop.ts`)**: When receiving a backpressure rejection:\n>    - Wait for a short period before trying again\n>    - Use exponential backoff with a maximum delay of around 10 seconds\n>    \n> This ensures the circuit never has any long-pending async operations due to backpressure, allowing other streams to make progress.\n> \n> ## Files to Modify\n> \n> 1. `src/Components/Server/src/Circuits/RemoteJSDataStream.cs` - Modify `ReceiveData` to:\n>    - Check if the pipe writer has available capacity before writing\n>    - If backpressure is detected (pipe is full), return immediately with a \"backpressure\" indicator instead of awaiting\n>    - Return a result that indicates whether the write succeeded, failed due to backpressure, or the stream is dead\n> \n> 2. `src/Components/Web.JS/src/Platform/Circuits/CircuitStreamingInterop.ts` - Modify `sendJSDataStream` to:\n>    - Handle a backpressure response from the server\n>    - When backpressure is indicated, wait with exponential backoff (starting at ~100ms, max ~10 seconds) before retrying\n>    - Continue trying to send the same chunk until it succeeds or the stream is cancelled\n> \n> 3. `src/Components/Server/src/ComponentHub.cs` - May need to update `ReceiveJSDataChunk` return type or add a new enum/status to indicate backpressure vs success vs stream-dead\n> \n> 4. Update or add unit tests in `src/Components/Server/test/Circuits/RemoteJSDataStreamTest.cs` to cover the backpressure scenario\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n*This pull request was created from Copilot chat.*\n>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65238","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix deadlock in Blazor Server file uploads with backpressure mechanism\" (#65238)"},{"Id":"3861011848","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-27T14:59:56","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"65244","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] InputSelect and related components analyzer","State":"open","Body":"For `InputSelect`, depending on the attributes used, the options provided in the body and the type used in the TValue, we might need to have specific `<option value=\"\">text</option>`.\n\nWe should consider an analyzer that warns about incorrect usages.

Failure","State":"open","Body":"When using `PublishAot=true` with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, the Request Delegate Generator emits an interceptor with the wrong parameter type, causing a CS9144 compile error.\n\n## Error\n\n```\nerror CS9144: Cannot intercept method 'EndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapGet(IEndpointRouteBuilder, string, RequestDelegate)' \nwith interceptor 'GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensionsCore.MapGet0(IEndpointRouteBuilder, string, Delegate)' \nbecause the signatures do not match.\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe generator incorrectly emits `Delegate` instead of `RequestDelegate` for the handler parameter:\n\n```csharp\n// Generated (WRONG):\ninternal static RouteHandlerBuilder MapGet0(\n    this IEndpointRouteBuilder endpoints,\n    string pattern,\n    Delegate handler)  // <-- Should be RequestDelegate\n\n// Original method being intercepted:\npublic static RouteHandlerBuilder MapGet(\n    this IEndpointRouteBuilder endpoints,\n    string pattern,\n    RequestDelegate requestDelegate)\n```\n\nThis happens specifically when:\n1. The lambda has signature `async (HttpContext ctx) => { ... }` (matches `RequestDelegate`)\n2. The lambda body references a source-generated `JsonSerializerContext`\n\nWhen both conditions are met, the RDG incorrectly chooses to intercept the `RequestDelegate` overload but generates an interceptor with `Delegate` parameter type.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n```bash\ndotnet build\n```\n\n## Minimal Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Text.Json;\n\nvar app = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder().Build();\n\napp.MapGet(\"/\", async (HttpContext ctx) =>\n{\n    // This line triggers the bug - using source-generated JsonSerializerContext\n    await ctx.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new Item(1), AppJsonContext.Default.Item));\n});\n\nawait app.RunAsync();\n\nrecord Item(int Id);\n\n[System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializable(typeof(Item))]\npartial class AppJsonContext : System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerContext { }\n```\n\n## Workaround\n\nExtract the lambda to a named method:\n\n```csharp\napp.MapGet(\"/\", (HttpContext ctx) => Handler(ctx));\n\nstatic async Task Handler(HttpContext ctx)\n{\n    await ctx.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new Item(1), AppJsonContext.Default.Item));\n}\n```\n\n## Environment\n\n- .NET 10.0\n- `PublishAot=true`\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.RequestDelegateGenerator\n\n## Generated Code Location\n\nBuild with `-p:EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles=true` to inspect:\n```\nobj/Debug/net10.0/generated/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.RequestDelegateGenerator/.../GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensions.g.cs\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65236","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Request Delegate Generator CS9144 Failure\" (#65236)"},{"Id":"3856573407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-26T15:59:15","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"65235","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Warn + suggest code fix when a `[JSInvokable]` method is non-public.*","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65235","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Warn + suggest code fix when a `[JSInvokable]` method is non-public.*\" (#65235)"},{"Id":"3856492352","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-26T15:38:14","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"65234","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Add Razor analyzer to warn when for-loop iterator variable is captured in lambdas, EventCallbacks, or data binding expressions","State":"open","Body":"### Summary\n\nAdd a Roslyn analyzer to detect and warn when a `for` loop iterator variable is captured in a lambda expression, `EventCallback`, two-way binding (`@bind`), or other closure context within Razor components. This is a common pitfall that leads to unexpected runtime behavior because all closures reference the same variable, which holds the final value after the loop completes.\n\n### Cases Where the Analyzer SHOULD Warn ⚠️\n\n#### 1. Lambda expressions in event handlers capturing `for` loop variable\n```razor\n@for (var i = 0; i < items.Length; i++)\n{\n    <button @onclick=\"@(() => SelectItem(i))\">Item @i</button>\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Two-way binding with `@bind` using loop variable as indexer\n```razor\n@for (var i = 0; i < stringArray.Length; i++)\n{\n    <input type=\"text\" @bind=\"stringArray[i]\" />\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. EventCallback parameters with captured loop variable\n```razor\n@for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)\n{\n    <MyComponent OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(i))\" />\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. RenderFragment/ChildContent capturing loop variable\n```razor\n@for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)\n{\n    <MyComponent>Count: @i</MyComponent>\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Lambda with event args still capturing loop variable\n```razor\n@for (var i = 1; i < 4; i++)\n{\n    <button @onclick=\"@(e => UpdateHeading(e, i))\">Button #@i</button>\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Cases Where the Analyzer Should NOT Warn ✅\n\n#### 1. Local variable copy within the loop body\n```razor\n@for (var i = 0; i < items.Length; i++)\n{\n    var index = i;\n    <button @onclick=\"@(() => SelectItem(index))\">Item @index</button>\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Using `foreach` (iteration variable is scoped per iteration in C# 5.0+)\n```razor\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <button @onclick=\"@(() => SelectItem(item))\">@item.Name</button>\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Using `foreach` with `Enumerable.Range`\n```razor\n@foreach (var i in Enumerable.Range(0, items.Length))\n{\n    <button @onclick=\"@(() => SelectItem(i))\">Item @i</button>\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Using `Index()` LINQ method (.NET 9+) for index and value\n```razor\n@foreach (var (index, item) in items.Index())\n{\n    <button @onclick=\"@(() => SelectItem(index))\">@item.Name</button>\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Using `Select` with index overload\n```razor\n@foreach (var entry in items.Select((item, index) => (item, index)))\n{\n    <button @onclick=\"@(() => SelectItem(entry.index))\">@entry.item.Name</button>\n}\n```\n\n#### 6. Direct method reference (no lambda/closure)\n```razor\n@for (var i = 0; i < items.Length; i++)\n{\n    <button @onclick=\"HandleClick\">Item @i</button>\n}\n```\n\n#### 7. Loop variable used only in non-closure contexts (display only)\n```razor\n@for (var i = 0; i < items.Length; i++)\n{\n    <span>Item @i</span>  // No closure, just rendering\n}\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65234","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Add Razor analyzer to warn when for-loop iterator variable is captured in lambdas, EventCallbacks, or data binding expressions\" (#65234)"},{"Id":"3856491347","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-26T15:37:59","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"65233","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Warn when performing JS interop outside of `OnAfterRender(Async)()` without checking `RendererInfo.IsInteractive`","State":"open","Body":"Warn when JS interop is used outside of `OnAfterRender(Async)` or inside methods that are called outside of `OnAfterRender(Async)` unless the method first checks `RenderHandle.RendererInfo.IsInteractive` to ensure that the context is interactive.\n\n### Background\n\nDuring prerendering, calling into JavaScript isn't possible because there's no live browser DOM connection. The `OnAfterRender{Async}` lifecycle events aren't called during prerendering - they only execute after the component renders interactively.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Scenarios Where We Should Warn\n\n### 1. JS Interop in `OnInitialized{Async}`\n\n```csharp\n@inject IJSRuntime JS\n\n@code {\n    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\n    {\n        // ⚠️ WARNING: JS interop called without checking RendererInfo.IsInteractive\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"console.log\", \"This will fail during prerendering!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.

JS Interop in Methods Called from Non-Interactive Lifecycle Methods\n\n```csharp\n@inject IJSRuntime JS\n\n@code {\n    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\n    {\n        await LoadDataAsync();\n    }\n\n    private async Task LoadDataAsync()\n    {\n        // ⚠️ WARNING: JS interop called in method invoked from OnInitializedAsync\n        var data = await JS.InvokeAsync<string>(\"fetchData\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. JS Interop in Form Event Handlers (Static SSR)\n\n```csharp\n@inject IJSRuntime JS\n\n<EditForm Model=\"model\" OnValidSubmit=\"HandleSubmit\">\n    ...\n</EditForm>\n\n@code {\n    private async Task HandleSubmit()\n    {\n        // ⚠️ WARNING: In static SSR, this handler is invoked server-side without interactivity\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"showSuccessNotification\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Correct Patterns (Should NOT Warn)\n\n### 1.

This change provides feedback with `ArgumentNullException` instead which can improving diagnostics to make the API contract better explicit.\r\n\r\n**Impact:**\r\n- No breaking changes, only adds validation\r\n- Better erroring for invalid input\r\n- Should be consistent with the .NET API design guidelines\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65219","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add null validation httpsclientslim\" (#65219)"},{"Id":"3852065697","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:04:13","Actor":"DarianBaker","Number":"65218","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix typo in ResponseDrainingTests comment","State":"open","Body":"# Fix typo in ResponseDrainingTests comment\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a pull request to our repo. -->\r\n<!-- If this is your first PR in the ASP.NET Core repo, please run through the checklist\r\nbelow to ensure a smooth review and merge process for your PR. -->\r\n- [x] You've read the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [x] You've included unit or integration tests for your change, where applicable.\r\n- [x] You've included inline docs for your change, where applicable.\r\n- [ ] There's an open issue for the PR that you are making.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

As well as [HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder) and [Introducing WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model) for migration guides.\n\nBelow is an example of converting `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder`:\n\n**Before**\n```csharp\nvar hostBuilder = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup()\n    .UseKestrel();\n// Test code might use TestServer:\nvar testServer = new TestServer(hostBuilder);\n```\n\n**After**\n```csharp\nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseTestServer() // If using TestServer\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\nawait host.StartAsync();\n\nvar testServer = host.GetTestServer();\n```\n\nBoth Copilot and ChatGpt have given good results so far when asked to convert a WebHostBuilder example to use HostBuilder.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Or authentication to fail if using TLS termination and expecting an https request.\n\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe change was made for security hardening, as the proxy and IP lists weren't being applied in all cases.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n- **Review your deployment topology:**  \n  Ensure that all legitimate proxy servers in front of your app are properly added to `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` in your `ForwardedHeadersOptions` configuration.\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownProxies = { IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_PROXY_IP\") }\n  });\n  ```\n  Or, for a network:\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownNetworks = { new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_NETWORK_IP\"), PREFIX_LENGTH) }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **If you wish to enable previous behavior:**  \n  You may need to relax your configuration, but this is **not recommended** due to security risks. You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

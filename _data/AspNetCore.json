When running CoreWCF tests, the value that is being returned is a negative value. For example, when debugging before opening this issue, the value returned was -11134. The value is different each time.\n\nAs the local port is predictable (we're running the test using port 44300), I was able to look at the local port number and work out what's going on. The value returned for the LocalPort was -21236. Converting 44300 and -21236 to hexadecimal yields the following values:\n\n-21236 -> FFFF AD0C\n44300 -> 0000 AD0C\n\nThis looks to be a sign extension bug caused by an incorrect representation of a port number. A TCP port number is an unsigned 16 bit value, so should be represented as a `ushort`. Presumably to avoid shipping a non-CLS compliant assembly, `ConnectionInfo.RemotePort` and `ConnectionInfo.LocalPort` are defined as a signed int (as a signed short would overflow). When retrieving the ushort from the native data structure, as the hex value 0xAD0C has the most significant bit set, when casting to an int32, it's sign extended to keep it a negative number and the first 2 bytes of the int32 incorrectly end up being 0xFFFF.  \n\nI didn't look at the unit tests, but I presume they aren't failing as this would only be seen for port numbers greater than 32,767.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`ConnectionInfo.LocalPort` and `ConnetionInfo.RemotePort` to return the correct value for port numbers greater than 32,767.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nCreate a service using HttpSys, and have a listening port greater than 32767. Retrieve the `LocalPort` from the connection info.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100-preview.4.25258.110\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is a regression from .NET 9 as this bug doesn't exist there.

changes in this PR:\r\n* Updated the Blazor Web App template to support passkey management and login\r\n* Added passkey (WebAuthn) support to ASP.NET Core Identity:\r\n    * New passkey store abstractions with updated store implementations in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore`\r\n    * New passkey abstractions for attestation and assertion\r\n    * Extensibility points in the default passkey handler for e.g., attestation statement validation\r\n    * Support for all cryptographic algorithms tested by the FIDO conformance testing tool, except EdDSA.\r\n    * New APIs in `SignInManager` and `UserManager` for passkey management and sign in\r\n* Added a sample project that can be run against the FIDO conformance testing tool\r\n\r\nNote that the goal of this PR is to add support for passkey authentication in ASP.NET Core Identity. While it implements core WebAuthn functionality, it does not provide a complete and general-purpose WebAuthn/FIDO2 library. The public API surface is limited in order to enable long-term stability of the feature. Targeted extensibility points were added to enable functionality not implemented by default, most notably attestation statement validation. This allows the use of third-party libraries to fill the missing gaps, when desired. Community feedback may result in additional extensibility APIs being added in the future.\r\n\r\nOpening initially as a draft to gather feedback. I will undraft as the PR nears its final state and tests are added, etc.\r\n\r\nFixes #53467","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62112","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add passkeys to ASP.NET Core Identity\" (#62112)"},{"Id":"3092475074","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-27T03:43:06","Actor":"SourceCodeWhen","Number":"62111","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add AllowedUsernameCharacters to InvalidUserName error","State":"open","Body":"# Add AllowedUsernameCharacters to InvalidUserName error\r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] You've read the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [X] You've included unit or integration tests for your change, where applicable.\r\n- [X] You've included inline docs for your change, where applicable.\r\n- [X] There's an open issue for the PR that you are making.

Please describe the problem.\nCurrently, Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection uses runtime reflection for dependency resolution, which introduces startup overhead and can present challenges for AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) scenarios (e.g., NativeAOT, Blazor WebAssembly). Community libraries such as Jab, ThunderboltIoc, and SourceInject demonstrate that C# source generators can provide compile-time DI containers that are significantly faster and more AOT-friendly.\n\nDescribe the solution you'd like\nInvestigate and consider implementing support for source generator-based dependency injection in ASP.NET Core. This could involve providing an official Roslyn-based source generator or a pluggable system, allowing developers to benefit from:\n- Compile-time validation of DI configuration\n- No runtime reflection for resolution\n- Reduced startup time and memory usage\n- Improved compatibility with NativeAOT and similar workloads\n\nDescribe the alternatives you've considered\nAlternatives include continuing with the current reflection-based system or using third-party libraries, but these lack official integration and may not support all ASP.NET Core patterns. Adopting a hybrid approach or providing extensibility points for DI source generators are also possible solutions.\n\nAdditional context\n- Community libraries: Jab, ThunderboltIoc, SourceInject\n- No open issue currently exists in aspnetcore specifically tracking source generator DI.\n- This feature could provide significant benefits for performance-critical and AOT workloads.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62104","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Investigate Support for Source Generator Based Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core\" (#62104)"},{"Id":"3089527837","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-25T19:39:28","Actor":"itbencn","Number":"62103","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issues with OpenAPI generation and XML comments compatibility in .NET 10 preview 4 controller APIs","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI have been testing the OpenAPI document generation in the .NET 10 Preview 4 version of the aspnetcore project for controller-based APIs (mini APIs are not tested or discussed here).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI encountered several issues related to how XML comments interact with OpenAPI generation:\n\n1. XML `<response>` comments on controller action methods:\n   The official documentation mentions support for XML `<response>` tags, but these do not seem to be translated into OpenAPI `paths.responses`. That is, the responses described in XML are missing from the generated OpenAPI YAML/JSON under the paths section.\n\n2. XML comments on controller classes:\n   - The class-level `<summary>` element is not converted into OpenAPI `tags.name`.\n   - The class-level `<remarks>` element is not converted into OpenAPI `tags.description`.\n   \n   For comparison, applying `[Tags(\"tagName\")]` attribute on the controller works fine and the tag name shows up correctly.\n   Applying `[Description(\"desc\")]` attribute on the controller does not translate into the tag's description, either.\n\n3. Enum support in OpenAPI schema:\n   - The current OpenAPI document generation does not correctly support enums.\n   - Enum options are missing from the generated OpenAPI schema, even though they are present in the XML documentation.\n   - According to OpenAPI specification, enums can be declared with `enum: [\"name1\", \"name2\"]` or `enum: [1, 2]`.\n   - It appears this feature is not properly supported or implemented yet in the .NET 10 preview 4 version.\n\nFinally, a question for discussion:\n- What is the recommended practice or approach to include enum member (individual enum value) documentation/comments into the OpenAPI documentation? For example, how to make each enum member's XML `<summary>` or other annotations appear in the OpenAPI schema description or extensions?\n\nWould appreciate any guidance or roadmap clarification on these points.\n\nThanks!\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100-preview.4.25258.110\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62103","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Issues with OpenAPI generation and XML comments compatibility in .NET 10 preview 4 controller APIs\" (#62103)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?   I am following the code here even though we have normal MVC and not razor pages like you have in the example.  I am still just calling \r\n\r\n>var signInUserResult = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(userName, password, rememberMe, true);\r\n\r\nNote: I am using Asp .net Identity in Identity server 4 application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/2079","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remember me isPersistent understanding\" (#2079)"},{"Id":"383297898","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-21T22:08:40","Actor":"mmillican","Number":"2080","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace a Role Validator","State":"closed","Body":"I am trying to create a custom role validator to support pseudo-multi-tenancy (which I know is not _officially_ supported in Identity) and am running into some issues.\r\n\r\nI've verified that my validator does work and is being called.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

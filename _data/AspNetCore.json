While this type comes from a package and cannot be modified, but it's possible to add such a method with the new extension members feature in C# 14:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic static class CSharpAnalyzerTestExtensions\r\n{\r\n    extension<TAnalyzer, TVerifier>(CSharpAnalyzerTest<TAnalyzer, TVerifier>) where ...\r\n    {\r\n        public static CSharpAnalyzerTest<TAnalyzer, TVerifier> Create([StringSyntax(\"C#-test\")] string source, params ReadOnlySpan<DiagnosticResult> expectedDiagnostics);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static CSharpAnalyzerTest<TAnalyzer, TVerifier> WithSource<TAnalyzer, TVerifier>(this CSharpAnalyzerTest<TAnalyzer, TVerifier> test, [StringSyntax(\"C#-test\")] string source);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing such a helper method could have some benefits:\r\n\r\n- It improves performance of tests because diagnostics are passed as `params ReadOnlySpan<DiagnosticResult>` that avoids array allocation. This is not possible with the async `VerifyAnalyzerAsync` method.\r\n\r\n- This allows to use additional helper methods that can be used to customize the test, to provide additional sources or test configuration if needed. For example, if each test needs some common code, test source code can be split into multiple 'files' and additional source can be provided using `WithSource` extension:\r\n\r\n  ```cs\r\n  private const string Program = \"\"\"\r\n      public class Program\r\n      {\r\n          public static void Main() { }\r\n      }\r\n      \"\"\";\r\n\r\n  public async Task Test()\r\n  {\r\n      var source = \"...\";\r\n      var test = CSTest.Create(source, CreateDiagnostic()).WithSource(Program); // CSTest is type alias\r\n      await test.RunAsync();\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  This avoids code duplication as otherwise common code has to be included in each test. This can also keep the test source code clean so that it contains only the code necessary for a particular test without additional 'noise'.\r\n\r\n- This will ensure that test C# code gets syntax highlighting in Visual Studio for tests creating `CSharpAnalyzerTest` instance explicitly so that it can be customized (please see #63642).\r\n\r\n- This will avoid the need to create 'local' helper methods in analyzer test classes that need to customize a test in some way.\r\n\r\n**Examples**\r\n\r\nI included some tests using this approach in #63657","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/63684","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[Proposal] Performance/usability improvements for analyzer tests\" (#63684)"},{"Id":"3417073260","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-15T09:24:38","Actor":"paule96","Number":"63682","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor WASM doesn't use cache after upadate from net9.0 to net10.0","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI noticed something weird for release builds in Blazor WASM .net10-rc1 published apps.\n\nFirst lets see what happens on net9.0. In net9.0 if you publish an Blazor WASM app, the app will load on the very first refresh quite long, because it will load around 15MB (my sample app with a bit of content)\nBut every other refresh will load just 0.5Mb.\nThe reason for this is that .net9.0 uses the cache storage of the browser just very good:\n\n<img width=\"2238\" height=\"977\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cbe96db-db66-472d-b530-f1989802e218\" />\n\nNow let's see what happens in net10.0-rc1.\nIf you publish now the app and make the first refresh you will download the same 15MB.\nBut at the second refresh you will download again 15mb.\nAnd if you look into the browsers cache storage you will find out that it is remained empty:\n\n<img width=\"1951\" height=\"1012\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97214544-02c0-4c7a-85f2-85ed3f3b0cd4\" />\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMy expectations would be that the behavior for caching is improved in a same way like it was in net9.0 (or better)\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a Blazor WASM standalone Projekt with net9.0\n2. Publish in Release mode\n3. Host it in any kind of reverse proxy\n  - I use IIS with a `xxx.localhost` domain\n  - I also use a valid certificate for https without warnings\n4. Check the things from the Issue describtion\n  - Mainly it is Developer Tools of the Browser (F12) -> Application -> Cache Storage\n5. Update the project to net10 (I did it with the copilot integration)\n6. Repeat step 2 to 4\n\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\n\n### Anything else?\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\n Commit:            2db1f5ee2b\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.a6e8bec0\n MSBuild version:   17.15.0-preview-25451-107+2db1f5ee2\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [maui-windows]\n   Installation Source: VS 18.0.11010.61, VS 17.14.36429.23\n   Manifest Version:    10.0.0-rc.1.25452.6/10.0.100-rc.1\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-rc.1\\microsoft.net.sdk.maui\\10.0.0-rc.1.25452.6\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maccatalyst]\n   Installation Source: VS 18.0.11010.61, VS 17.14.36429.23\n   Manifest Version:    18.5.10727-net10-rc.1/10.0.100-rc.1\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-rc.1\\microsoft.net.sdk.maccatalyst\\18.5.10727-net10-rc.1\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [ios]\n   Installation Source: VS 18.0.11010.61, VS 17.14.36429.23\n   Manifest Version:    18.5.10727-net10-rc.1/10.0.100-rc.1\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-rc.1\\microsoft.net.sdk.ios\\18.5.10727-net10-rc.1\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [android]\n   Installation Source: VS 18.0.11010.61, VS 17.14.36429.23\n   Manifest Version:    36.0.0-rc.1.285/10.0.100-rc.1\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-rc.1\\microsoft.net.sdk.android\\36.0.0-rc.1.285\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [wasm-tools]\n   Installation Source: VS 18.0.11010.61, VS 17.14.36429.23, VS 17.14.36429.23, VS 17.14.36429.23\n   Manifest Version:    10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107/10.0.100-rc.1\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-rc.1\\microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.current\\10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [wasm-tools-net8]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36429.23\n   Manifest Version:    10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107/10.0.100-rc.1\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-rc.1\\microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.net8\\10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\nNo workload sets are installed.

prevent AntiforgeryValidationException in Blazor WASM","State":"open","Body":"The `ComponentStatePersistenceManager.InferRenderModes` method was iterating forward through the `_registeredCallbacks` collection, which caused callbacks to be skipped when other callbacks modified the collection during iteration.\n\n## Problem\n\nIn Blazor Web Applications with global WASM interactivity, the `ResourceCollectionProvider` disposes its subscription during the persistence process, which removes its entry from the `_registeredCallbacks` collection while the collection is being iterated. This causes subsequent callbacks (particularly the `DefaultAntiforgeryStateProvider`) to be skipped, leading to missing antiforgery tokens and resulting in `AntiforgeryValidationException` during logout operations.\n\n## Solution\n\nChanged the `InferRenderModes` method to iterate backwards through the `_registeredCallbacks` collection, matching the pattern already implemented in the `TryPauseAsync` method. This ensures that all registered callbacks are executed even when some callbacks remove themselves from the collection during iteration.\n\n**Before:**\n```csharp\nfor (var i = 0; i < _registeredCallbacks.Count; i++)\n```\n\n**After:**\n```csharp\nfor (var i = _registeredCallbacks.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)\n```\n\nThis change includes the same explanatory comment used in `TryPauseAsync` to maintain code consistency and document the reasoning behind the backward iteration pattern.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Verified existing unit tests continue to pass\n- Confirmed the build succeeds with the changes\n- The fix addresses the root cause identified in the issue analysis\n\nFixes #58822.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Please describe the problem.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nWhen AspNetCoreModuleV2 is missing in IIS (e.g., Hosting Bundle not installed), IIS and \"appcmd\" only report a vague “Configuration error” with no details. This makes root cause analysis extremely difficult in production. A clearer error pointing to the missing Hosting Bundle would greatly improve diagnostics.\n\n### **Description**\n\n**Problem**\nWhen deploying an ASP.NET Core 8 app to IIS, if the server does not have the ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle installed (so AspNetCoreModuleV2 is missing), the site’s web.config with <aspNetCore> element causes IIS to throw a generic error.\n\n**For example, running:**\n%windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd list config \"Default Web Site/MyApp\"\n**returns only:**\nERROR (message: Configuration error\nFilename: D:\\...\\web.config\nLine Number: 0\nDescription: )\n\nThis gives no actionable information. It does not indicate that the aspNetCore handler is unrecognized or that the Hosting Bundle is missing.\n\n**#area-IIS#Enhancement#aspnetcore#deployment**\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n**IIS / ANCM should report a clearer error, such as:**\nUnrecognized configuration section 'system.webServer/aspNetCore'.\nEnsure the ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle is installed and AspNetCoreModuleV2 is available.\n\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n### **Reproduction Steps**\n\n**1. On a clean Windows Server (2019/2022) with IIS installed but without the .NET Hosting Bundle:**\nAdd-WindowsFeature Web-Server, Web-Asp-Net45\n\n**2. Create a new IIS site (e.g. MyApp) and add this web.config to its root folder:**\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<configuration>\n  <system.webServer>\n    <handlers>\n      <add name=\"aspNetCore\" path=\"*\" verb=\"*\" \n           modules=\"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" resourceType=\"Unspecified\" />\n    </handlers>\n    <aspNetCore processPath=\"dotnet\" arguments=\".\\MyApp.dll\" />\n  </system.webServer>\n</configuration>\n\n**3. Run**\n%windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd list config \"Default Web Site/MyApp\"\n\n**4. Observe the output:**\nERROR (message: Configuration error\nFilename: D:\\...\\web.config\nLine Number: 0\nDescription: )\n\n### **Expected Result**\nA clear error message that indicates the aspNetCore section is not recognized because AspNetCoreModuleV2 is missing. Example:\nUnrecognized configuration section 'system.webServer/aspNetCore'.\nEnsure the ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle is installed.\n\n### **Real-World Impact**\n1. In our production environment, the Hosting Bundle was not properly registered, and the AspNetCoreModuleV2 handler was missing.\n2. The IIS Manager GUI showed only a generic “configuration error” with no details.\n3. Running appcmd list config gave the unhelpful output shown above (empty description).\n4. This made it extremely difficult to diagnose. We had to spend hours checking configs, comparing UAT vs PROD, and even reinstalling IIS features before finally discovering the root cause.\n5. A clearer message pointing directly to the missing Hosting Bundle would have saved several hours of downtime and troubleshooting in a production-critical environment.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63672","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Enhancement - Improve IIS error reporting when AspNetCoreModuleV2 is missing\" (#63672)"},{"Id":"3413296976","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-13T11:59:20","Actor":"lauxjpn","Number":"63671","RawContent":null,"Title":"[AOT] Using two `MapDelete()` routes with distinct patterns but same parameter name lets source generator use wrong parameter source in second route","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWith native AOT enabled:\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\n    <PropertyGroup>\n        <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n        <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n        <InvariantGlobalization>true</InvariantGlobalization>\n        <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>\n    </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\nThe resolution of route `/test1/42` of the following code will not succeed when called like `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://127.0.0.1/test1/42\" -Method Delete`:\n\n```cs\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\n// Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://127.0.0.1:80/test0?name=42\" -Method Delete\n// Works as expected.\napp.MapDelete(\"/test0\", ([FromQuery] string name) => Results.Ok());\n\n// Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://127.0.0.1/test1/42\" -Method Delete\n// Fails with:\n// Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.BadHttpRequestException: Required parameter \"string name\" was not provided from query string.\napp.MapDelete(\"/test1/{name}\", ([FromRoute] string name) => Results.Ok());\n\napp.Run();\n```\n\nThe reason seems to be, that the source generator is taking the `[FromQuery]` attribute from the `name` parameter of the *first* route `/test0`, and reuses it for the `name` parameter of the second route `/test1/{name}` (same parameter name), even though the second route explicitly declares `name` as `[FromRoute]`, which the source generator ignores. Thus it expects a query parameter in the Uri, even though it should expect a routing argument.\n\nSwitching the order of the route declarations in the source code will switch what the source generator expects. But the `name` parameter of the later declared route is always expected by the source generator to be provided in the same way as for the former declared route.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA later declared `MapDelete()` route should not inherit the parameter source (e.g. `[FromQuery]`) of earlier declared `MapDelete()` routes. And this inheritance should definitely not override the explicit one (e.g. `[FromRoute]`) declared in the later route.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSee description.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.BadHttpRequestException: Required parameter \"string name\" was not provided from query string.\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Generated.<GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensions_g>F3631FD46BF4370BA35BC57E80ED6E2D63BA9276F07031EC5F6198ED23869E4EB__LogOrThrowExceptionHelper.RequiredParameterNotProvided(String parameterTypeName, String parameterName, String source) in D:\\Projects\\AspNetCoreIssues\\AspNetCoreIssue\\obj\\Debug\\net9.0\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.RequestDelegateGenerator\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.RequestDelegateGenerator.RequestDelegateGenerator\\GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensions.g.cs:line 340\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Generated.<GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensions_g>F3631FD46BF4370BA35BC57E80ED6E2D63BA9276F07031EC5F6198ED23869E4EB__GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensionsCore.<>c__DisplayClass2_0.<MapDelete0>g__RequestHandler|5(HttpContext httpContext) in D:\\Projects\\AspNetCoreIssues\\AspNetCoreIssue\\obj\\Debug\\net9.0\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.RequestDelegateGenerator\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.RequestDelegateGenerator.RequestDelegateGenerator\\GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensions.g.cs:line 114\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext httpContext)\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointRoutingMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext httpContext)\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.DeveloperExceptionPageMiddlewareImpl.Invoke(HttpContext context)\n```\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.300\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63671","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[AOT] Using two `MapDelete()` routes with distinct patterns but same parameter name lets source generator use wrong parameter source in second route\" (#63671)"},{"Id":"3413285263","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-13T11:52:14","Actor":"Chandradev819","Number":"63670","RawContent":null,"Title":"ValidatableType complex modal validation is not working with Blazor Web Assembly (Standalone) 10 RC1","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHi Team, \n\nAs per as Microsoft documentation, I had created two sample projects, one in Blazor Web App and Blazor WebAssembly Standalone application. \n\n [ValidatableType] validation attribute for complex modal validation is working as expected in Blazor Web App 10.0 RC1 but not working in Blazor Web Assembly 10.0 RC1. \n\nis it known issue?

They both represent the same concept and are both used in the codebase. However users will only be able to update the new one, and clearing it won't affect the previous one which is still used throughout the code.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests to ensure that the expected behavior is not broken when using a single property. The previous tests were manipulating both, which users can't do.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

As well as [HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder) and [Introducing WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model) for migration guides.\n\nBelow is an example of converting `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder`:\n\n**Before**\n```csharp\nvar hostBuilder = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup()\n    .UseKestrel();\n// Test code might use TestServer:\nvar testServer = new TestServer(hostBuilder);\n```\n\n**After**\n```csharp\nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseTestServer() // If using TestServer\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\nawait host.StartAsync();\n\nvar testServer = host.GetTestServer();\n```\n\nBoth Copilot and ChatGpt have given good results so far when asked to convert a WebHostBuilder example to use HostBuilder.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

It can be set directly or by registering a provider in the Dependency Injection container.\r\n\r\n`TimeProvider` does not truncate to the nearest second, consumers are expected to correctly format the time as needed.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nUnifying the time abstraction across the stack for easier testing.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nComponents that derive from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SecurityStampValidator<TUser>` should remove their `ISystemClock` constructor parameter and call the new base constructor accordingly. Similarly, derived implementations that reference the `Clock` property on these types should reference the new `TimeProvider` property instead. `TimeProvider` is now settable for testing on the options or via DI.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder, ISystemClock clock)\r\n-        : base(options, logger, encoder, clock)\r\n+    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder)\r\n+        : base(options, logger, encoder)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-       var currentUtc = Clock.UtcNow;\r\n+       var currentUtc = TimeProvider.GetUtcNow();\r\n```\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- [`ISystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.isystemclock)\r\n- [`SystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.systemclock)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>.Clock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1.clock)\r\n- [`CookieAuthenticationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationhandler)\r\n- [`FacebookHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.facebook.facebookhandler)\r\n- [`GoogleHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.google.googlehandler)\r\n- [`JwtBearerHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.jwtbearerhandler)\r\n- [`MicrosoftAccountHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.microsoftaccount.microsoftaccounthandler)\r\n- [`NegotiateHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.negotiate.negotiatehandler)\r\n- [`OAuthHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.oauth.oauthhandler-1)\r\n- [`OpenIdConnectHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.openidconnect.openidconnecthandler)\r\n- [`PolicySchemeHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.policyschemehandler)\r\n- [`RemoteAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.remoteauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignInAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signinauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignOutAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signoutauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`TwitterHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.twitter.twitterhandler)\r\n- [`WsFederationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.wsfederation.wsfederationhandler)\r\n- [`SecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.securitystampvalidator-1)\r\n- [`TwoFactorSecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.twofactorsecuritystampvalidator-1)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/505","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider\" (#505)"},{"Id":"1661290568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T20:06:20","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"504","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` no longer use custom converters","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nPrior to .NET 8 Preview 2, `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` type used custom converters to support JSON serialization due to a lack of support for the `IgnoreNullValues` option.

dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"Greetings ASP.NET Core community!\r\n\r\nA few months back, we [sent out a survey](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39936) to the community to get some feedback on how approachable and productive our repo was (amongst other factors). This post is a summary of the results of this survey for curious minds.\r\n\r\nFirst things first, we had a total of 33 respondents for the survey. It's a considerable drop from the 61 we had last year, so we want to focus on a higher response rate moving forward.\r\n\r\n**Overall Satisfaction**\r\nThe NSAT score for the repo was overall improved for this area (+22 between 2021 and 2022). We invested some time over the past year in adding Codespaces support for the repo, adding a form for reporting bugs, and updating documentation on our triage process which we attribute to improvements in this score.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1857993/163862943-16fb804b-7c56-4d21-82ba-3d9d94fb5447.png)\r\n\r\n**How easy is it to find a fix?**\r\nIn 2021, we spent some time adding README's documenting the contents of each directory in our repo to make it easier to understand where different code components lived. With this in mind, we've seen improvements in the \"ease of finding where to make a fix\" stat for the repo.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1857993/163864046-7171afd9-1a2a-4ab8-99ca-042ca707df7a.png)\r\n\r\n**How responsive is the maintainer team to issues?**\r\nEach sub-team within the ASP.NET Core repo does around 2-3 triage sessions per week where we review newly filed issues. This shows in a generally improved NSAT for our responsiveness query. We continue to find ways to make sure that our triages are timely and that each issue is addressed in a speedy manner. Ensuring that bug reports are complete and reproducible is a great way to help us out in this effort!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1857993/163864681-ac33ddd6-ec2f-4df0-a574-5b01263b489b.png)\r\n\r\n**Ability to debug code**\r\nOne of the primary factors we consider when assessing repo productivity is tracking how easy it is to debug a code change. We've improved a bit in this regard with the introduction of Codespaces support and improvements to our Visual Studio installation scripts. However, we continue to focus on improvements for this area as there is still some difficulty when it comes to building the repo.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1857993/163865465-af4ec78c-2328-43c5-a271-538f56d9b2f1.png)\r\n\r\n**Suggestions**\r\nImproving our repo is an on-going process and we've captured a few suggestions from the survey that outline worthwhile improvements including:\r\n\r\n- \"when labeling the issues, having a priority level added will be nice to have so we will know the possible ETA on issue resolution.\"\r\n- \"The build process needs to allow me easier to build a part of the full repo. When I want to contribute to a small part of the project, I really don't care about the other parts, especially native or Java dependent stuff. Just give me an out of the box experience to build just the things I want.

In this case, when using MediaTypeHeaderValue.TryParse to parse the header, the MediaTypeHeaderValue will include those double quotes as boundary when parsing the header.\r\n\r\nLet's say the header from MultipartFormDataContent is:\r\n```\r\nmultipart/form-data; boundary=\"71e9da95-c5e7-4a9b-901a-ededd613dcd4\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe boundary value will be retrieved as ```\"71e9da95-c5e7-4a9b-901a-ededd613dcd4\"``` with the double quotes, instead of the ```71e9da95-c5e7-4a9b-901a-ededd613dcd4``` without the double quotes.\r\n\r\nAccording to rfc2046 section 5.1.1 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046.html#section-5.1.1, the double quotes are used to avoid parsing error and should be removed when parsing the content body. \r\n\r\nLong Story:\r\n\r\nUsing https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/5.x/LargeFilesSample as example, we want to test how to use C# to create a client uploading large files.\r\nWe changed the runtime from .net5 to .net6 so that it follows our production environment.\r\n\r\nThe following are the client side code snippet using .NET6 Console Application plus  package:\r\n```<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\" Version=\"2.2.0\" />```\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n    // Based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/28242716/3200008\r\n    using var client = new HttpClient()\r\n    {\r\n        Timeout = TimeSpan.FromDays(1)\r\n    };\r\n    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(\"User-Agent\",\"dotnet-http-client\");\r\n    using var content= new MultipartFormDataContent();\r\n    var path = @\"C:\\bin1234.dat\";\r\n    using var sc = new ByteArrayContent(new byte[]{1,2,3,4});\r\n    sc.Headers.ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue(\"application/octet-stream\");\r\n    sc.Headers.ContentDisposition = new ContentDispositionHeaderValue(\"form-data\")\r\n    {\r\n        Name = @\"\"\"file\"\"\",\r\n        FileName = @$\"\"\"{Path.GetFileName(path)}\"\"\"\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    content.Add(sc, \"file\", Path.GetFileName(path));\r\n\r\n    \r\n    var url = \"http://localhost:54900/FileUpload/UploadLargeFile\";\r\n    using var response = await client.PostAsync(url, content);\r\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Status: {response.StatusCode}; Msg: {await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()}\");\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, we always got exception from the controller: \r\n```\r\nUnexpected end of Stream, the content may have already been read by another component.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe couldn't figure out why. Using the PostMan, Curl in CLI, or javascript in browser, we can always get the correct response. \r\n\r\nThe exception was found to be thrown at https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/5e1401df3eb523da89fdb968dab35ff2610c8925/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/5.x/LargeFilesSample/Controllers/FileUploadController.cs#L50\r\n```c#\r\n    var section = await reader.ReadNextSectionAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo figure out what has been run, we tried to dump all the payload: here is the payload:\r\n```text\r\n--3bf2175e-bc64-44f2-8c59-d8b51b1ed334\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"bin1234.dat\"\r\n\r\n\r\n--3bf2175e-bc64-44f2-8c59-d8b51b1ed334--\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it seems nothing special.\r\n\r\nWe even  tried to use the same payload to playback, and the request completed without a hitch.\r\n```c#\r\n    await using var fs = File.OpenRead(\"C:\\\\bin1234_bad.dmp\");\r\n    var boundary = \"3bf2175e-bc64-44f2-8c59-d8b51b1ed334\";\r\n    var reader = new MultipartReader(boundary, fs);\r\n    var section = await reader.ReadNextSectionAsync(CancellationToken.None);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter further debugging, we noticed that the when request are sent by HttpClient via MultipartFormDataContent, the boundary value is always a GUID, and in the header, it is enclosed with double quotes:\r\n```\r\nmultipart/form-data; boundary=\"71e9da95-c5e7-4a9b-901a-ededd613dcd4\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in the body, the boundary string are:\r\n```\r\n--3bf2175e-bc64-44f2-8c59-d8b51b1ed334\r\n```\r\nas beginning and \r\n```\r\n--3bf2175e-bc64-44f2-8c59-d8b51b1ed334--\r\n``` \r\nas final.\r\n\r\nWe've traced into the call of https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/5e1401df3eb523da89fdb968dab35ff2610c8925/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/5.x/LargeFilesSample/Controllers/FileUploadController.cs#L43, and the return result of ```mediaTypeHeader``` have a boundary value of ```\"3bf2175e-bc64-44f2-8c59-d8b51b1ed334\"``` (with double quotes), and causing the following ```ReadNextSectionAsync``` failed with exception \"Unexpected end of Stream, the content may have already been read by another component.\"\r\n\r\nThe request sent from browser javascript httpclient, or curl does not have double quotes in their boundary value in header, which will not causing the problem\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nHttpClient can upload large file using MultipartFormDataContent to an aspnet server side controller using https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/5.x/LargeFilesSample without getting exception.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run server code from https://github.com/aDisplayName/bugsamplecode/tree/main/20220418/Server\r\n2. Run client code from https://github.com/aDisplayName/bugsamplecode/tree/main/20220418/client\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```text\r\nStatus: InternalServerError; Msg: System.IO.IOException:

It is based on a [Twitter thread with several ASP.NET developers](https://twitter.com/sebastienros/status/1311060155174322176) from this repository, and not Azure developers, so I am posting it here and we can take it from there. :)\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be that when a swap occurs in Azure, it only sends an HTTP request, not an HTTPS request.  This is not configurable.  The result in an HTTPS-only App Service is that a redirect occurs and the warmup never happens.  In order to make this work, the directions from this well-written blog post must be followed:\r\nhttps://haacked.com/archive/2020/09/28/azure-swap-with-warmup-aspnetcore/\r\n\r\nOne of the steps is to turn off HTTP-only, which reduces security posture and accordingly creates an alert from Azure Advisor when runs its security checks:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/55706533/azure-how-to-fix-web-application-should-only-be-accessible-over-https-warnin\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen the warmup ping pings, it pings as a ping is supposed to ping, resulting in a proper warmup. :)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSpend several days setting up swapping and wonder why your application is taking as much time warming up after a \"warmup\" as it does with a direct deployment:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/807835/swap-warmup-takes-same-time-as-straight-deployment.html\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nNA\n\n### .NET Version\n\nNA\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI <3 you all. :) :) :)  Really nice work out there regardless of this issue.\r\n\r\n![](https://c.tenor.com/KwzJzUMKR7MAAAAC/hero-youre-my-hero.gif)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41231","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Azure Web Swaps Warmup Pings Do Not Support HTTPS\" (#41231)"},{"Id":"1206646937","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-18T04:24:39","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"41229","RawContent":null,"Title":"Document how to use ASP.NET Core with trimming","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

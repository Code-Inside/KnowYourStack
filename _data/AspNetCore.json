Please describe the problem.\n\nI just wasted an entire day's worth of productivity trying to fix an obscure bug relating to Blazor's SPA navigator. I got to learn the hard way that specifying `<base href=\"~/\"/>` in the root layout's `<head>` section is absolutely crucial for SPA to work as intended. Omitting this tag will cause navigation links in lower-level routes to break completely as SPA navigators, and act as regular anchor tags instead, causing a full page refresh when the user clicks on them.\r\n\r\nFor example, navigation between root-level pages (e..g `/Index`, `/Counter`, etc...) still works fine without the `<base/>` tag, but nav links pointing from lower-level pages (more than one '/' in the path, e.g. `/Users/View`) to higher level pages will not work as intended, causing the behavior described above.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSince the presence of this tag is mandatory in order for SPA to work as intended, and there is pretty much no use case (that I can think of) where one would intentionally omit it from the layout, it would be incredibly useful if the Blazor Framework would generate some sort of error/warning log message in the server's console, in case this tag is not present during page render.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue can happen in two cases: When a user is just starting out with Blazor, and doesn't yet know about this requirement; or when using a custom HTML template not originally made for Blazor, that doesn't have the tag by default. In my case, it was the combination of both, and I paid the price.\r\n\r\nThis was an incredibly hard bug to find, especially with no prior experience with Blazor, and the suggested warning message might save the next developer from falling into the same trap.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43146","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Blazor Server] Warn developer if the <base/> tag is missing from the root layout\" (#43146)"},{"Id":"1331773773","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-08T16:18:18","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] (deps): Bump src/submodules/spa-templates from `d5773b7` to `bbd5404`","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps [src/submodules/spa-templates](https://github.com/dotnet/spa-templates) from `d5773b7` to `bbd5404`.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/spa-templates/commit/bbd5404010791a6c0f364cd2b7ed1cd4b2846864\"><code>bbd5404</code></a> Increase color contrast on focus highlight for counter button.

Right now there is no way to do it easily.\r\n\r\nMost `SignInManager` sign in methods have an overload which accepts an `AuthenticationProperties` parameter, but not `ExternalLoginSignInAsync`.\r\n\r\nSo right now, there is no straightforward way to persist authentication tokens in the application cookie during external login.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;\r\n\r\npublic class SignInManager<TUser> where TUser : class\r\n{\r\n+    public virtual async Task<SignInResult> ExternalLoginSignInAsync(string loginProvider, string providerKey,\r\n+          bool bypassTwoFactor, AuthenticationProperties properties) ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nIn the asp.net core identity quick start scaffolded item `ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs` in the method `OnGetCallbackAsync(...)` you might want to persist external login tokens by like so:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar info = await _signInManager.GetExternalLoginInfoAsync();\r\nif (info == null) {\r\n    ErrorMessage = \"Error loading external login information.\";\r\n    return RedirectToPage(\"./Login\", new { ReturnUrl = returnUrl });\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar props = new AuthenticationProperties();\r\nprops.StoreTokens(info);\r\n\r\nvar result =\r\n    await _signInManager.ExternalLoginSignInAsync(info.LoginProvider, info.ProviderKey, bypassTwoFactor: true, props);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nThere is no regression or performance risks, the only risk is that by including this API we imply that this practice is considered good, while some might think it is not because it increases cookie size and also makes it easy to store the refresh token in the cookie which also might be considered bad practice.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, this solution is still proposed as valid in the documentation (with the cookie size caveat).\r\n\r\n## Additional Info\r\n\r\nPR #43132 shows a possible implementation of this change\r\nIssue https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/12047 shows one complaint regarding the lack of this API.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43138","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add overload with `AuthenticationProperties` to `SignInManager.ExternalLoginSignInAsync`\" (#43138)"},{"Id":"1331574279","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-08T09:15:39","Actor":"TehWardy","Number":"43137","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sessions - How to report / capture engagement information.","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nToday ASP.NET Core allows specifying the scheme (http/https), host and port via a URL like syntax in ASPNETCORE_URLS and via the `IServerAddressesFeature`. This issue suggests we expand that the syntax supported to make it a bit more intuitive as this is a common production and container scenario. We want to make it more intuitive to specify the host and port or just the port to use for ASP.NET CORE applications. We can also take the opportunity to revisit what this new syntax would mean with respect to what the defaults are when pieces are unspecified.\r\n\r\nNote: * and + are hold overs from HTTP.sys that we support on Kestrel as well but it's not obvious to most users (in fact + and * mean different things with HTTP.sys but not with Kestrel). I'm not sure if 0.0.0.0 work with HTTP.sys.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWhen specifying the URL, we should support the following syntax:\r\n- `{host}:{port}` - Scheme = http, The host and port are specified\r\n- `:{port}` or `{port}` = Scheme = http, host = bind to all addresses (the equivalent of + or * today), port specified.\r\n\r\ne.g. \r\n\r\nvia code\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello World\");\r\n\r\napp.Urls.Add(\"8080\"); // 8080 and all addresses\r\napp.Urls.Add(\":8081\"); // 8081 and all addresses \r\napp.Urls.Add(\"localhost:8082\"); // 8082 and localhost\r\napp.Urls.Add(\"http://+:80\"); // 80 and all addresses\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nASPNETCORE_URLS=:8080;8081;localhost:5000;http://+:80\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Open questions**:\r\n- If the port is specified as 443, do we infer https? I think no, if you want TLS, specify the full URL including the scheme, host and port.\r\n- Do we support this with HTTP.sys? Yes we should pick if this syntax means * or +.\r\n- When this syntax is specified in code or via configuration what happens when you read `IServerAddressesFeature.Addresses`? These should return the processed urls.\r\n- Do we make a breaking change to rename `Urls` to `Addresses` on `WebApplicationBuilder`?

I find this is clunky though, and I'm not sure how likely additional future parameters really are.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Metadata;\r\n\r\npublic sealed class EndpointMetadataContext\r\n{\r\n-     public EndpointMetadataContext(MethodInfo method, IList<object> endpointMetadata, IServiceProvider applicationServices);\r\n+     public EndpointMetadataContext(MethodInfo method, EndpointBuilder builder);\r\n\r\n      public MethodInfo Method { get;

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change.

Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

Eg.:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-0f87920dc675fdfdf8d7638d3be66577-bd6bdbf32d21b714-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"\": [\r\n+      \"A non-empty request body is required.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"value\": [\r\n      \"The value field is required.\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is an alignment with other parts of the framework that were already using the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody) and also a fix to a reported issue dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29570\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nNo change is required, however, if you getting an unexpected behavior is recommended to review if your client's requests are sending the appropriated headers/information.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC Action Controllers","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/484","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding\" (#484)"},{"Id":"1154726545","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T01:08:45","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"483","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Event IDs for some Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core log messages changed","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs part of updating the Microsoft.AspNetcore.Mvc.Core assembly to use `LoggerMessageAttribute`, we discovered logger event Ids being reused within a single log category.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

If you were previously using `app.Use` but never calling the `next` middleware, you will now get a compiler error (CS0121). If that's the case you should use `app.Run` instead of `app.Use`.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 6.0-preview4\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await next();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await SomeAsyncWork();\r\n    // next never called\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    await next(context);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that you can now pass `context` to the `next` delegate.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.Run(async (context) =>\r\n{\r\n    await SomeAsyncWork();\r\n    // next never called\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `app.Run` when your middleware never calls `next`, otherwise you will get a compile error:\r\n`CS0121 The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'UseExtensions.Use(IApplicationBuilder, Func<HttpContext, Func, Task>)' and 'UseExtensions.Use(IApplicationBuilder, Func<HttpContext, RequestDelegate, Task>)'`\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe previous `Use` method would allocate 2 objects per request. The new overload avoids these allocations with a small change to how you invoke the next middleware.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you get a compile error, it means you are calling `app.Use` without using the `next` delegate.

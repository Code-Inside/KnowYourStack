MORE PROPS....\n}\n\nThe expected behavior is that when I press the submit button in the form, it fires the validation as shown in the following picture:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17419535-68ed-427d-933c-c99fd98c29d2)\n\nUnfortunately when I press the submit button (in this case, the \" add me!\" button) only the property in the main object (Product Name) is validated, the other one, is completely ignored, as shown below:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e6cc839-dd6e-4221-ab4b-924798f561c9)\n\nThe validation message is shown only if I manually input for example a negative number or remove a number and/or use the up/down number selector on the right of the control... but as soon as I press the submit button, it voids the error message and says all is good, as shown below\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b790723-24b0-4254-918c-7f7cb5367a0b)\nand when I press the button, the Product Price says to be ok... even knowing that before it was saying it was not...\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5de85ca7-5701-43d5-ae99-e529b10a0d8c)\n\nI tried to use DataAnnotationsValidator and the ObjectGraphDataAnnotationsValidator but the behavior is the same, tried also v7 server side, not 8, but the behavior is there too.\n\nI created another property, a copy of the actual price property from the Data object, and put it in the root of the main object, and there it behaves correctly, in the following example, you will see 2 prices, the first one is the problematic, and the other one is a property called price2, in the root\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/225c1161-6d12-43c7-a1bb-9d22df15e799)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is that the validation should fire correctly for numeric properties in the root object and should also work inside a nested property (in this case, Data > price ) when we press the submit button in the form as shown in the following image:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/863281f1-7e24-4a1c-a9e4-b2d14fc3d675)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nPlease download the project files, run the project and try to validate PRODUCT PRICE (price) located in the Data object of the root object.\n\n[BlazorSampleApp1.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20357966/BlazorSampleApp1.zip)\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8 and 7\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62039","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Validation not firing when pressing submit button on nested numeric property\" (#62039)"},{"Id":"3078441827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-20T23:22:15","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"62038","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Backport 9.0] [IIS] Manually parse exe bitness (#61894)","State":"open","Body":"Backport of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/61894\r\n\r\n# [IIS] Manually parse exe bitness\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn the AspNetCoreModule for IIS we have a check that dotnet.exe is the same architecture as the worker process (w3wp.exe).

While record types correctly show these attributes, class types don't:\n\n```csharp\n// Works: Schema includes age range constraints of 0-120\npublic record UserRecordDto([property: Range(0, 120)] int age);\n\n// Doesn't work: Schema doesn't show age range constraints\npublic class UserClassDto([property: Range(0, 120)] int age)\n{\n    public int Age => age;\n}\n```\n\nThis inconsistency is occurring because record primary constructors auto-generate properties that carry the attributes, but class primary constructors don't.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe implementation enhances the schema generation process to:\n1. Detect when a type is using a primary constructor\n2. Find constructor parameters that match property names in the schema\n3. Apply any validation attributes from those parameters to the corresponding property schemas\n\nThis ensures consistency between validation behavior and OpenAPI documentation, particularly for class types using C# 12's primary constructor feature.\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded tests in two forms:\n- A unit test checking the schema generation directly\n- An integration test using a real HTTP server to verify attributes appear correctly in the schema\n\nFixes #61538.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `dc.services.visualstudio.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `/home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/.dotnet/dotnet msbuild /m /nologo /clp:Summary /v:minimal /nr:true /warnaserror /p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=false /home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/artifacts/toolset/restore.proj /t:__WriteToolsetLocation /clp:ErrorsOnly;NoSummary /p:__ToolsetLocationOutputFile=/home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/artifacts/toolset/10.0.0-beta.25265.101.txt ` (dns block)\n> - `pkgs.dev.azure.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `/home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/.dotnet/dotnet msbuild /m /nologo /clp:Summary /v:minimal /nr:true /warnaserror /p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=false /home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/artifacts/toolset/restore.proj /t:__WriteToolsetLocation /clp:ErrorsOnly;NoSummary /p:__ToolsetLocationOutputFile=/home/REDACTED/work/aspnetcore/aspnetcore/artifacts/toolset/10.0.0-beta.25265.101.txt ` (dns block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config)\n>\n> </details>\n\n\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

So Example: `[\"Flag1\", \"Flag2\"]` instead of `\"Flag1, Flag2\"`.\n\nTo do this, I created the following JsonConverter below. I've tested this in other places (Kafka (de)serialization, unit tests outputting JSON snapshots), and it works fine.\n\n**However, when I want to view my OpenAPI document, it fails to generate, crashing the process with a stack overflow.**\n\n```csharp\n/// <summary>\n/// This converter is used to serialize and deserialize flags enums as arrays.\n/// Note: the default enum value (Unknown/None/0) is not included in the output array.\n/// Example: [\"Flag1\", \"Flag2\"] instead of \"Flag1, Flag2\".\n/// </summary>\n/// <typeparam name=\"T\">An enum decorated with [Flags]</typeparam>\npublic class FlagsEnumAsArrayConverter<T> : JsonConverter<T>\n    where T : struct, Enum\n{\n    public override T Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)\n    {\n        if (reader.TokenType != JsonTokenType.StartArray)\n        {\n            throw new JsonException($\"Expected StartArray token, got {reader.TokenType}\");\n        }\n\n        T value = default;\n        reader.Read();\n        while (reader.TokenType != JsonTokenType.EndArray)\n        {\n            if (reader.TokenType != JsonTokenType.String)\n            {\n                throw new JsonException($\"Expected string in array, got {reader.TokenType}\");\n            }\n\n            var flagName = reader.GetString();\n            if (!Enum.TryParse<T>(flagName, out var flag))\n            {\n                throw new JsonException($\"Invalid flag value: {flagName}\");\n            }\n\n            value = (T)Enum.ToObject(typeof(T), Convert.ToInt64(value) | Convert.ToInt64(flag));\n            reader.Read();\n        }\n\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, T value, JsonSerializerOptions options)\n    {\n        var names = value.ToString().Split(\", \", StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);\n        writer.WriteStartArray();\n        foreach (var name in names)\n        {\n            writer.WriteStringValue(name);\n        }\n\n        writer.WriteEndArray();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect the OpenAPI document to generate correctly as outputting an array of enum values. Or at the very least, an array of strings.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI created a reproducable sample repository here: https://github.com/wsloth/aspnetcore-flagsenum-arrayconverter-issue\n\nIt contains both a .NET 9 and a .NET 10 Preview 4 project. They both contain the issue, but it seems like the .NET 9 executable crashes entirely, while the .NET 10 executable keeps running (but does output \"stack overflow\" in the console).\n\nI was diving into the internals on the .NET 9 version, and saw that it went wrong in `OpenApiJsonSchema`, specifically in `ReadOpenApiAny`. It would see the array start token, but it had no value at all in the schema (it looked like `[ ]`) before reaching the end token.\n\nI'm not sure if there _should_ be a value in this array, or if the issue is that if there is a value, it's another instance of the `FlagsEnum`, which enters another (de)serialization loop which generates yet another array.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\n...

Describe the bug\n\nWhen using SwaggerUI with the built-In OpenAPI interface in .Net 9, enum members are not displayed in the Schemas section.\n\nOpenAPI generates the enum schema:\n```\n      \"MyStatus\": {\n        \"enum\": [\n          \"MyStatus1\",\n          \"MyStatus2\",\n          \"MyStatus3\"\n        ]\n      },\n``` \n\nIn SwaggerUI enum members are not displayed in the

We wanted to merge the original PR asap, without re-running the CI.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n- `DoesNotRenderChildAfterRendererStopped` -> it was testing if illegal render was possible after we stopped the renderer, the feedback suggested a flow of: render 1st time -> stop renderer - render 2nd time and check if render batches number grew.\r\n- `TestEndpointHtmlRenderer` had its own mechanism of stopping the renderer, not connected to base's class stopping. Making the `EndpointHtmlRenderer` stopping method internal, allows the test to call it. Because we want `TestEndpointHtmlRenderer` to keep track of the number of batches rendered, we keep the stopping method on `TestEndpointHtmlRenderer` as well.\r\n- Attributes can use parameters passed

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

For example, the options associated with that scheme should be configured correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.SuppressAutoDefaultScheme` app context flag.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Changes in default authentication scheme handling for ASP.NET Core\" (#490)"},{"Id":"1287742787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T18:44:22","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"488","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs detailed in dotnet/aspnetcore#42413, the file-serving middleware (`DefaultFilesMiddleware`, `DirectoryBrowserMiddleware`, and `StaticFileMiddleware`) have been updated to no longer no-op (i.e. defer to the next middleware in the pipeline) in the case that there is an active endpoint with a `null` request delegate.\r\n\r\nPR that makes the change: dotnet/aspnetcore#42458\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nPreviously, if the current request had an active endpoint, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint() != null`, the file-serving middleware would perform no action and simply delegate to the next middleware in the request pipeline.\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe file-serving middleware will now only perform no action if there is an active endpoint and its `RequestDelegate` property value is not `null`, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint()?.RequestDelegate is not null`.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThis change will enable endpoints to be active in the request for the purposes of setting and sharing metadata with middleware that are endpoint-aware so that they can perform their intended function, while allowing other middleware (like the file-serving middleware) that would usually defer their behavior when an endpoint is active to also function.\r\n\r\nFor example, an endpoint with a `null` request delegate containing authorization metadata can be set as the active endpoint for a request, causing the `AuthorizationMiddleware` to enforce authorization requirements, which if satisfied would allow the `StaticFileMiddleware` to serve the requested files.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you are relying on setting an active endpoint on the request to suppress the behavior of the file-serving middleware, ensure that the endpoint has a non-null value set for its `RequestDelegate` property.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseStaticFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDefaultFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDirectoryBrowser()`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active\" (#488)"},{"Id":"1278667050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T16:03:03","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"487","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Unit testing SignalR Hubs may need updating","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`IHubClients` and `IHubCallerClients` now hide interface members `IClientProxy Client(string connectionId);` and `IClientProxy Caller { get;

For development scenarios, use\n// Hot Reload instead. For more information, visit https://aka.ms/aspnet/deprecate/003.\n```\n\nHowever, when you pass no argument to the method, it does not show a warning:\n\n```c#\nmvcBuilder.AddRazorRuntimeCompilation(); // no \"obsolete\" warning here\n```\n\nSo, is it just the first overload that's being obsoleted? Or, when you say \"Razor runtime compilation is obsolete\", does that mean that in the future we MUST use `dotnet watch` to run our MVC application, and classic Razor runtime compilation is being removed completely?\n\nThis is a problem for me, since in my development workflow, I do not want my entire application to get rebuilt every time I make a change to a Razor page. When I am running my application, and I make a change to a Razor page, I only want the Razor subsystem to recompile, not my entire application. **I also do not want the web page to reload.**\n\n- When I make a change to a `.cs` file, I don't want anything to happen. I will manually rebuild and restart the localhost server when I am done making changes.\n- When I make a change to a `.cshtml` file, I only want the Razor subsystem to recompile, but only when I manually reload my page in the browser. Right now, with the Razor runtime recompilation, this works great--the Razor subsystem only recompiles my views when application tries to access one of them, for example when I reload the page (like a lazy-recompile).\n\nLastly, when I develop, I do not run my MVC application using Visual Studio, nor do I use the `dotnet` CLI. I run a separate instance of IIS Express that points to my application's DLL using a shortcut target:\n\nTarget: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c (set LAUNCHER_PATH=dotnet&&set LAUNCHER_ARGS=.\\bin\\Release\\net10.0\\MyProject.dll&&\"C:\\iisexpress\\iisexpress.exe\" /path:\"C:\\projects\\example.com\\MyProject\" /port:8081 /trace:error)`\n\nThis works great for me, because I can create a little icon on my desktop that runs my development server with a console window, with just a single mouse click. The current Razor runtime compilation feature works well with this setup.\n\nIn conclusion, what exactly is being removed from .NET regarding Razor runtime compilation, and will we be forced to use the `dotnet watch` command in the future if we want anything resembling Razor runtime recompilation? If we are forced to use the `dotnet watch` command going forward, how can I modify my shortcut target shown above to accommodate that?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64338","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET 10 and Razor: Please clarify what you mean by \"Razor runtime compilation is obsolete\"\" (#64338)"},{"Id":"3618103456","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-12T20:24:34","Actor":"awebre","Number":"64335","RawContent":null,"Title":"OpenAPI Generation No Longer Groups Endpoints Using WithGroupName","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn .NET 9, multiple Open API spec docs could be generated with a specific name utilizing the `.WithGroupName` extension method on either the group itself or particular endpoints. This allowed for a name other than the group's prefix to be used for grouping endpoints into an OpenAPI document that utilized a name other than the group's route prefix.\n\nNow, it seems that the OpenAPI generator does not group those endpoints into the related spec document and instead excludes them entirely.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI should be able to group endpoints in an OpenAPI Spec document named something other than the Group prefix, utilizing `.WithGroupName(\"MyGroupName\")` and `.AddOpenApi(\"MyGroupName\")`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI have a minimal repro solution that demonstrates the behaviors here:\nhttps://github.com/GoValidate/AspNetCore-Net10-OpenApi-Repro\n\nThe OpenApiNet9 and OpenApiNet10 are carbon copies of each other, with one targeting .NET 9 (and the .NET 9 version of AspNetCore OpenAPI) and the other targeting .NET 10 (and the .NET 10 version of AspNetCore OpenAPI).

Meaning the same .NET JSObject is returned for the same JavaScript object. (Unless it has already been disposed or garbage collected).\n\nThis is a really nice feature, because it allows you to synchronize various things between the two worlds.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to work when the JavaScript object is a constructor, for example:\n```\nexport function getDivElement() {\n    return HTMLDivElement;\n}\n```\n\nThis means that code like:\n```\nelement.constructor == HTMLDivElement\n```\nDoesn't work inside the .NET engine, because the JSObject from HTMLDivElement doesn't maintain it's instance correctly.\n\nIt's a bit hard to explain, so please see the attached BlazorJSImportBugReport.zip\n[BlazorJSImportBugReport.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23498040/BlazorJSImportBugReport.zip)\n\nClicking \"Test Regular Objects\" shows that the JSObject instances works correctly with regular objects:\n<img width=\"253\" height=\"89\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1c56cf6-3468-4054-ba86-a96a6d38910b\" />\n\nClicking \"Test HTMLDivElement Constructor\" shows that it doesn't work for constructor objects:\n<img width=\"269\" height=\"97\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/901ab496-81dd-4132-bb83-2d1c5177f203\" />\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expact any JavaScript object returned by a JSImport function to maintain it's identity, so the same JSObject is returned for the same JavaScript object.

There is a \"solution\" that I found today, but it's on the weird side of things. I'm looking for some input where I might find the actual underlying cause.\n\nI have a \"normal\" request pipeline with auth, routing, endpoints and a couple custom middlewares. There is a `ControllerBase` `[ApiController]` executing  a request. What I've been chasing is the `ObjectDisposedException` that can be thrown when trying to access the `DefaultHttpContext.Features` property, but from within the active request. I catch that exception in the controller action and log it there before returning an explicit error to the client. On the face of it, there are two ways for this to happen that I could identify.\n\nOne is when `Uninitialize` overwrites the `_features` member with the struct default. I think I have successfully concluded that this is not what's happening. There is a log enricher that takes the HttpContext from `IHttpContextAccessor` and, if not null, logs several of its (nested) properties, including many that are sourced from the feature collection. This includes `context.RequestAborted.IsCancellationRequested`, which is always `false`. In addition, there is an `[UnsafeAccessor]` for the `_active` field of the `DefaultHttpContext` and this is always `true` in the logs. The log enricher runs synchronously in the `catch` within the controller action.\n\nThe other is the possibility of a corruption from trying to access `HttpContext` properties concurrently as outlined [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42040). This is where I spent most of my energy trying to identify if we have that anywhere, but I couldn't identify a pattern from the code. My plan today was to write a custom `IHttpContextFactory` that would return a `DefaultHttpContext` wrapped by a custom HttpContext implementation type that checks for concurrent access.\n\nHowever, after deploying just a custom `IHttpContextFactory` that just mimics the implementation of `DefaultHttpContextFactory`, including returning a normal `DefaultHttpContext`, all of the ODEs that happened ~10 times per minute went away entirely. I realize that `HostingApplication` has some special sauce for the internal members of `DefaultHttpContextFactory` that doesn't run with a custom factory, but I fail to see how that can cause the effects that I had been observing.\n\nCustom factory code:\n```\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Options;\n\nnamespace Services;\n\npublic class ConcurrencyCheckingHttpContextFactory : IHttpContextFactory {\n  private readonly IHttpContextAccessor? _httpContextAccessor;\n  private readonly FormOptions _formOptions;\n  private readonly IServiceScopeFactory _serviceScopeFactory;\n\n  public ConcurrencyCheckingHttpContextFactory(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) {\n    _httpContextAccessor = serviceProvider.GetService<IHttpContextAccessor>();\n    _formOptions = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOptions<FormOptions>>().Value;\n    _serviceScopeFactory = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IServiceScopeFactory>();\n  }\n\n  public HttpContext Create(IFeatureCollection featureCollection) {\n    var httpContext = new DefaultHttpContext(featureCollection);\n\n    if (_httpContextAccessor != null) {\n      _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext = httpContext;\n    }\n\n    httpContext.FormOptions = _formOptions;\n    httpContext.ServiceScopeFactory = _serviceScopeFactory;\n\n    return httpContext;\n  }\n\n  public void Dispose(HttpContext httpContext) {\n    if (_httpContextAccessor != null) {\n      _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext = null;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this at the end of the `Startup.ConfigureServices` method\n```\n    services.Replace(new(typeof(IHttpContextFactory), typeof(ConcurrencyCheckingHttpContextFactory), ServiceLifetime.Singleton));\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64309","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Possible DefaultHttpContext corruption with the default factory\" (#64309)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

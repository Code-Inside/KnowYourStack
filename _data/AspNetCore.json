Even if the `OperatingSystem.IsWindows` return true, the application return errors when i try to start on services.msc.\r\nThis does not happen in .net core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nWindows Services via `IHostBuilder`\r\n1. Create a normal .net 5 project.\r\n2. Add this refences to allow Windows Services: \r\n\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore\r\n- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices\r\n\r\n3. On `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder` add .UseWindowsService()\r\n\r\n4.

Create service on cmd via `sc create`\r\n\r\n\r\nWindows Services via `IWebHostBuilder`\r\n\r\nThe process is identical up to point 2, inclusive.\r\n\r\n3. Use this code via WebHost to create Windows Service Run.\r\n```\r\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().RunAsService();\r\n       }\r\npublic static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            return WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n                .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) =>\r\n                {\r\n                })\r\n                .UseStartup<Startup>();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Create service on cmd via `sc create`\r\n\r\nThe application will return `Exception Info: System.PlatformNotSupportedException: ServiceController enables manipulating and accessing Windows services and it is not applicable for other operating systems.`\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\nVisual Studio 16.8.5\r\n```\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   5.0.103\r\n Commit:    72dec52dbd\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17763\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.103\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 5.0.3\r\n  Commit:  c636bbdc8a\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.111 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.406 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30315","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The .NET 5 return Platform Not Supported if you try to use .NET 5 as a Windows Service application.\" (#30315)"},{"Id":"812380480","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-19T23:27:38","Actor":"Kahbazi","Number":"30311","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support CancellationToken in MapAction","State":"closed","Body":"Addresses https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29684\r\n\r\n/cc @halter73\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/30311","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Support CancellationToken in MapAction\" (#30311)"},{"Id":"812422236","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-19T23:13:28","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"30314","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove Razor components workaround","State":"open","Body":"The MSBuild target it's trying to wire up to no longer executes for 6.0 projects.

The ability to save a file and have the browser auto-refresh is a huge time saver.  Unfortunately, most of the apps that I work on are internal line of business apps that rely on using Windows Authentication -- which only works if using IIS Express.

The proposal here is to provide a new primitive that we use and that third-party code can use too to initialize their components. We will move our own initialization code to use this new primitive and enable third-party customers/libraries to also implement it.\r\n\r\nThe way this works at a high level is:\r\n* We will provide an \"Initializer<TContext>\" interface that we will resolve from DI.\r\n* Our TContext will be what the host platform passes to the initializer.

The reason for the low severity is to reduce the log noise misbehaving clients can create. Here's an example log:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndbug: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel[17]\r\n      Connection id \"0HM6L1I0L7H4A\" bad request data: \"Invalid request header: 'X-Http-Method : PATCH\\x0D\\x0A'\"\r\n      Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.BadHttpRequestException: Invalid request header: 'X-Http-Method : PATCH\\x0D\\x0A'\r\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Http.HttpParser`1.ParseHeaders(TRequestHandler handler, SequenceReader`1& reader)\r\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Http.Http1Connection.TakeMessageHeaders(SequenceReader`1& reader, Boolean trailers)\r\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Http.Http1Connection.ParseRequest(SequenceReader`1& reader)\r\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Http.Http1Connection.TryParseRequest(ReadResult result, Boolean& endConnection)\r\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Http.HttpProtocol.ProcessRequests[TContext](IHttpApplication`1 application)\r\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Http.HttpProtocol.ProcessRequestsAsync[TContext](IHttpApplication`1 application)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be a problem when the misbehaving clients are legitimate clients of a production service, and developers want to see more detail about why request are being rejected without enabling all \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\" debug logs in production which could be overwhelming.\r\n\r\nOne workaround might be to filter logs by EventID (e.g. don't log debug-level \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\" logs unless it has `EventId(17, \"ConnectionBadRequest\")`). The problem with that is that [AddFilter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.filterloggingbuilderextensions.addfilter?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0) doesn't support this. As of today, you are stuck writing your own ILoggerProvider to get this functionality which is quite complicated.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to see details around bad requests without increasing the log severity, I'm proposing a new category for bad request logs. Maybe \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.BadRequests\". These logs would still be debug-level, but it would be much easier to filter.\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we'll have to decide whether we duplicate logs to avoid breaking logic depending on bad request logs log being in the \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\" category. I think duplicate logs are annoying enough we shouldn't do that, but we do need to consider this is technically a breaking change.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30301","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Create subcategories for better filtering Kestrel logs\" (#30301)"},{"Id":"812277728","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-19T19:26:51","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"30300","RawContent":null,"Title":"Flaky Test RegeneratingWithReference_CachesOutput","State":"open","Body":"Failed 4 times in the past 2 weeks\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssert.True() Failure\\nExpected: True\\nActual:   False\r\n   at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Razor.ProjectSystem.DefaultDocumentSnapshotTest.RegeneratingWithReference_CachesOutput() in /_/src/Razor/test/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Razor.Workspaces.Test/ProjectSystem/DefaultDocumentSnapshotTest.cs:line 116\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location ---\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=1003077&view=results\r\n\r\ncc @NTaylorMullen \r\n\r\nI don't think the tooling repo has any sort of quarantine process?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30300","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Flaky Test RegeneratingWithReference_CachesOutput\" (#30300)"},{"Id":"812044050","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-19T19:22:13","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"30292","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make Ignitor test more strongly typed, and fix failure introduced with custom event args change","State":"closed","Body":"Technically we could just fix the anonymously-typed data to match the new protocol, but this will be more resistant to similar problems in the future.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/30292","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Make Ignitor test more strongly typed, and fix failure introduced with custom event args change\" (#30292)"},{"Id":"812212983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-19T17:44:42","Actor":"mkArtakMSFT","Number":"30299","RawContent":null,"Title":"Identify all SVG related improvements in Blazor","State":"open","Body":"This is the ground-work for https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18271.\r\nThe goal is to have an itemize list of all the small improvements we will need to do in this area for .NET 6.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30299","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Identify all SVG related improvements in Blazor\" (#30299)"},{"Id":"812159271","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-19T16:26:22","Actor":"mikoskinen","Number":"30297","RawContent":null,"Title":"Published Blazor WASM app not loading appsettings.production.json, environment shows \"Production\"","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI have published a Blazor WASM app into Azure Blob Storage's \"Static web site\" (container $www).

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

All breaking changes to nullability annotations will be aggregated into this issue throughout the course of .NET 6.0.**_\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0, we have been applying nullability annotations to parts of ASP.NET Core. From the outset of this effort, [we anticipated that mistakes would be made](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/api-guidelines/nullability.md#breaking-change-guidance) in these annotations and fixes would need to be made. In .NET 6.0, we are updating some annotations that have been previously applied. Some of these changes are considered source breaking changes because it leads to the APIs being incompatible or more restrictive, or could result in build-time warnings when used in projects that have nullable reference types enabled.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27564 for further discussions.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe affected APIs had incorrect nullable reference type annotations and build warnings were either absent or incorrect.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNew build warnings will be produced and incorrect build warnings will no longer be produced for the affected APIs.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThrough feedback and further testing, the nullable annotations for the affected APIs were determined to be inaccurate. The updated annotations now correctly represent the nullability contracts for the APIs.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nUpdate code calling these APIs to reflect the revised nullability

For example, if a razor class library defined a static web asset to be served under `/folder/file.txt` and the host placed a file under `wwwroot/folder/file.txt` the file on the server would silently override the file on the Razor Class Library or Blazor Webassembly application.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core will now correctly detect when this issue happens and inform of the conflict so that users can be aware and take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis was a bug in the implementation, we never intended for static web assets to be \"overridable\" by files on the wwwroot host of the project since that leads to errors that are hard to diagnose and can result in undefined behavior changes when applications are published.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason for a file on a Razor Class Library to conflict with a file on the host by default since they are prefixed with `_content/${PackageId}` unless we are discussing Blazor Webassembly applications, which get placed by default at the root of the host url space, which makes conflicts easier. (For example, Blazor Webassembly Applications contain a favicon.ico that the host might also include in their wwwroot folder).\r\n\r\nIf the source of the conflict is a file in a Razor Class Library it normally means there is some code that copies the assets from the library into the wwwroot folder of the project. We don't recommend developers doing that since it defeats one of the main goals of static web assets which is that files don't have to be copied around, which is fundamental to get updates on the browser when the contents are updated without having to trigger a new compilation.\r\n\r\nIf despite that you want to preserve this behavior and maintain the file on the host, you can do so by removing the file from the list of static web assets with a custom MSBuild target.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the file on the razor class library or the blazor webassembly file instead of the file from the host project, just remove the file from the host project.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updated validation logic for Static Web Assets\" (#443)"},{"Id":"724794249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T19:05:24","Actor":"tatti9018","Number":"442","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"Help with feature “Control Startup class activation”\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n            .ConfigureWebHost(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.UseStartup(context => new Startup(logger));\r\n            })\r\n            .Build();\r\n```\r\nWhen I use Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly”, I get error: ‘IHostBuilder’ does not contain a definition for ‘ConfigureWebHostDefaults’\r\nWhen I set Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, project see ConfigureWebHostDefaults, but project doesn’t work….","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/442","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work\" (#442)"},{"Id":"712253766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-30T20:21:51","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5","State":"open","Body":"## Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5\r\n\r\n.NET 5 introduces a variety of [new Blazor features](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514), some of which are not compatible with certain older browsers.

Starting from ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1, all of those readonly public fields have changed to readonly public properties.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect this change to affect many developers because:\r\n\r\n * Any application or library that simply uses `.razor` files (or even manual `RenderTreeBuilder` calls) to define its components would not be referencing this type directly\r\n * The `RenderTreeFrame` type itself is regarded as an implementation detail, not intended for use outside the framework. ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later includes an analyzer that issues compiler warnings if the type is being used directly.\r\n * Even if you do reference `RenderTreeFrame` directly, this change is binary-breaking but not source-breaking. That is, your existing source code will still compile and behave properly. You will only encounter an issue if compiling against the 3.x framework and then running those binaries against the 5.0 RC1 and later framework.\r\n\r\n## Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1\r\n\r\n## Old behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` were defined as fields, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\n## New behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` are defined as properties with the same names as before, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\nIf older precompiled code has not been recompiled since this change, it may throw an exception similar to *MissingFieldException: Field not found: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame.FrameType'*.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary in order to implement some high-impact performance improvements in Blazor component rendering on ASP.NET Core 5.0 while retaining the same level of safety and encapsulation as before.\r\n\r\n## Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Blazor developers will not be affected and do not need to take action. This is most likely to affect library/package authors, but still only rarely. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* If you are developing an application, and either staying on ASP.NET Core 3.x or upgrading to 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to make any changes to your own code.\r\n   * However if you depend on a library that needs to upgrade to account for this change, then you would need to update to a newer version of that library.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support only ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to take any action. Just ensure that your `csproj` declares the `TargetFramework` value `net5.0`.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support both ASP.NET Core 3.x *and* 5.0, then check whether or not your code attempts to read any of the members of `RenderTreeFrame` (for example, evaluating `someRenderTreeFrame.FrameType`).\r\n    * Most libraries will not do that. This includes libraries that contain `.razor` components. In this case you don't need to take any action.\r\n    * However, if your library does do that, then you will need to use multitargeting to support both `netstandard2.1` and `net5.0`. First, in your `csproj`, replace the existing `<TargetFramework>` with `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`. Then instead of referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` with a fixed version number such as 3.0.0, use a conditional reference to account for both versions you wish to support. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"3.0.0\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"5.0.0-rc.1.*\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' != 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further clarification, see this [diff showing how @jsakamoto already upgraded his `Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement` library in this way](https://github.com/jsakamoto/Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement/commit/090df430ba725f9420d412753db8104e8c32bf51).\r\n\r\n## Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fields on RenderTreeFrame have become properties\" (#438)"},{"Id":"696062913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T17:46:46","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

For example:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar jsObjectReference = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync<JSObjectReference>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n`JSObjectReference` will be made `internal`, so the new `IJSObjectReference` type must be used instead:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar jsObjectReference = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also applies for `JSInProcessObjectReference`, which was replaced by `IJSInProcessObjectReference`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe change makes this feature more consistent with other patterns within Blazor. `IJSObjectReference` is analogous to `IJSRuntime` in that it serves a similar purpose and has similar methods and extensions.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nReplace all occurrences of `JSObjectReference` and `JSInProcessObjectReference` with `IJSObjectReference` and `IJSInProcessObjectReference` in your code.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.JSInterop.JSObjectReference`\r\n`Microsoft.JSInterop.JSInProcessObjectReference`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf no APIs are affected, this should read:\r\n     \"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n  If affected APIs are identifiable, include a link for each.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the default behavior of `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBy default, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found (i.e. the exception handler returns a 404) when the middleware executes. To allow 404 responses to be returned by the exception handler, please configure the option `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. When this option is set to true, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run. The exception thrown will be handled by the server. For example, the exception will be converted to a 500 error response by Kestrel HTTP server or HTTP.SYS server. \r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility using the current behavior, where a 404 response from the exception handler is allowed, please set `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. See \"New behavior\" section for details.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n\r\nSee discussion at: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/25288\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/434","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ExceptionHandlerMiddleware will throw original exception if exception handler cannot be found\" (#434)"},{"Id":"684954186","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-24T20:45:36","Actor":"NTaylorMullen","Number":"433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Removed RazorTemplateEngine API","State":"open","Body":"*Please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/25215 to discuss this change*\r\n\r\n## Removed RazorTemplateEngine API\r\n\r\nThe `RazorTemplateEngine` API was removed in favor of `RazorProjectEngine`.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n3.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\nA template engine could be created and used to parse and generate code for Razor files\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nA `RazorProjectEngine`  can be created and fed the same type of information as a `RazorTemplateEngine` to parse and generate code for Razor files.

So, starting with .NET 5 preview 7, the `.razor` compiler will omit insignificant whitespace by default.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, this will not have any effect on the visual layout of the rendered component, since the whitespace nodes being removed would not normally affect it. However, the whitespace might affect the rendered output if you are using a CSS rule like `white-space: pre`. If you need to preserve the whitespace, you can use the new directive `@preservewhitespace true` at the top of your `.razor` file, or inside an `_Imports.razor` file to apply the preference to an entire subdirectory or even your whole project.\r\n\r\nFor further discussions, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23568\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following `.razor` code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n    @foreach (var item in Items)\r\n    {\r\n        <li>\r\n            @item.Text\r\n        </li>\r\n    }\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would previously have rendered two whitespace nodes outside the `@foreach`, and then two more around the `<li>`, and then two more around `@item.Text`. If the list contained 100 items, this would have been 402 whitespace nodes - i.e., more than half of all nodes rendered, even though none of them would visually affect the rendered output. Eliminating them at compile time greatly improves performance for rendering and diffing.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes were preserved\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes are removed if:\r\n\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within an element\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within a `RenderFragment` parameter (e.g., child content being passed to another component)\r\n * ... they precede or follow a C# code block such as an `@if`, `@foreach`, etc.\r\n\r\n... except if the `@preservewhitespace` directive is used with value `true`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nPerformance. See above.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIn most cases no action is required, as applications will typically continue to behave normally (but faster). If the whitespace stripping causes any problems for a particular component, use `@preservewhitespace true` in that component to disable this optimization.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\nBlazor\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor components now trim insignificant whitespace by default\" (#426)"},{"Id":"646581464","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-27T01:24:05","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"425","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.*, Microsoft.JSInterop.* packages will no longer target netstandard2.1","State":"open","Body":"## Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components, Microsoft.JSInterop packages no longer target netstandard2.1\r\n\r\nIn 3.2, Blazor WebAssembly applications compiled to netstandard2.1.

For `OpenApiSchemaServiceTests.GetOpenApiRequestBody_GeneratesSchemaForPoco` it adds the `Todo` schema 2 times:\n\n1. `https://openapi.net/d6bd3466-1e30-4009-a52a-c5e42c50c184#/components/schemas/https://openapi.net/d6bd3466-1e30-4009-a52a-c5e42c50c184/components/schemas/Todo`\n2. `https://openapi.net/d6bd3466-1e30-4009-a52a-c5e42c50c184#/components/schemas/Todo`\n\nThe first is added in the `OpenApiDocumentExtensions.AddOpenApiSchemaByReference` method. The second is added in the `OpenApiDocumentService.GetOpenApiDocumentAsync` (`document.Workspace.RegisterComponents(document)`). This last one scans all components and adds them to the workspace (so they are correct from a OpenAPI.NET point of view).\n\nI tried changing `OpenApiDocumentExtensions.AddOpenApiSchemaByReference` to one of the following:\n\n- `document.Workspace.RegisterComponentForDocument(document, schema, schemaId);`\n- `document.AddComponent(schemaId, schema);`\n\nBoth add the schema as expected to the workspace but it fails some tests caused by circular references. This is because the moment they are added correctly to the workspace they are used when resolving references. The way how `RegisterComponent` works is different than just assigning the schema in `document.Components.Schemas[schemaId] = schema;`. `RegisterComponent` does not overwrite a component (`TryAdd`), but assigning does.\n\nRelated method:\n```csharp\n    public static IOpenApiSchema AddOpenApiSchemaByReference(this OpenApiDocument document, string schemaId, IOpenApiSchema schema)\n    {\n        if(schema is OpenApiSchemaReference)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Schema is already a reference.\", nameof(schema));\n        }\n\n        document.Components ??= new();\n        document.Components.Schemas ??= new Dictionary<string, IOpenApiSchema>();\n        document.Components.Schemas[schemaId] = schema;\n        document.Workspace ??= new();\n        var location = document.BaseUri + \"/components/schemas/\" + schemaId;\n        document.Workspace.RegisterComponentForDocument(document, schema, location);\n        \n        object? description = null;\n        object? example = null;\n        if (schema is OpenApiSchema actualSchema)\n        {\n            actualSchema.Metadata?.TryGetValue(OpenApiConstants.RefDescriptionAnnotation, out description);\n            actualSchema.Metadata?.TryGetValue(OpenApiConstants.RefExampleAnnotation, out example);\n        }\n\n        return new OpenApiSchemaReference(schemaId, document)\n        {\n            Description = description as string,\n            Examples = example is JsonNode exampleJson ? [exampleJson] : null,\n        };\n    }\n```\n\nMy proposed fix is to remove the whole part around the workspace in `AddOpenApiSchemaByReference` as it's not used anyway for resolving references. In the `OpenApiDocumentService` we still keep the initialization of the workspaces which gives is a correctly initialized workspace.\n\nThe below passes all tests:\n```csharp\n    public static IOpenApiSchema AddOpenApiSchemaByReference(this OpenApiDocument document, string schemaId, IOpenApiSchema schema)\n    {\n        if(schema is OpenApiSchemaReference)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Schema is already a reference.\", nameof(schema));\n        }\n\n        document.Components ??= new();\n        document.Components.Schemas ??= new Dictionary<string, IOpenApiSchema>();\n        document.Components.Schemas[schemaId] = schema;\n        \n        object? description = null;\n        object? example = null;\n        if (schema is OpenApiSchema actualSchema)\n        {\n            actualSchema.Metadata?.TryGetValue(OpenApiConstants.RefDescriptionAnnotation, out description);\n            actualSchema.Metadata?.TryGetValue(OpenApiConstants.RefExampleAnnotation, out example);\n        }\n\n        return new OpenApiSchemaReference(schemaId, document)\n        {\n            Description = description as string,\n            Examples = example is JsonNode exampleJson ?

When InteractiveAuto render mode is used with prerendering, the page first renders with Static Server rendering and then, as soon as the WASM is loaded, it switches to Interactive WebAssembly rendering. \nIt does not switch to Interactive Server rendering while the WASM is loading. \nThis results in a degraded user experience as, after the page loads, it is not interactive for a few seconds until the WASM is loaded.\nI'm displaying @RendererInfo.Name on the page to determine which renderer is being used. \n\n2. When InteractiveAuto render mode is used without prerendering, the page takes a few seconds to load, and \nloads with Interactive WebAssembly rendering. \n\nIn both cases, It looks like the page never switches to Interactive Server rendering.\n\nIn case this helps - when a page with InteractiveAuto render mode is loaded on FireFox with WASM support turned off, the page loads with Static Server rendering and does not switch to Interactive Server rendering.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. When InteractiveAuto render mode is used with prerendering, the page should:\n\t1. first render with Static Server rendering, and then \n\t2. quickly switch to Interactive Server rendering (and become interactive), and the finally\n\t3. switch to Interactive WebAssembly rendering after the WASM is loaded. \n2. When InteractiveAuto render mode is used without prerendering, the page should: \n\t1. load with Interactive Server rendering (and become interactive), and then\n\t2. switch to Interactive WebAssembly rendering after the WASM is loaded. \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI uploaded a solution to highlight this issue ([here](https://github.com/pushmlk/InteractiveAutoBug)). \nThe issue can be seen in the counter.razor page.\n1. Run the solution in debug mode. Refresh the counter page several times. You will see the render mode go from Static directly to WebAssembly (Issue#1).\n2. Change the render mode on the top of the page to @rendermode @(new InteractiveAutoRenderMode(prerender: false)) and run the solution in debug mode. \nRefresh the counter page several times. You will see the render mode go directly to WebAssembly without first going to Server Interactive rendering (Issue#2).\n\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI tested this with .NET 10.0 and Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Preview (version 17.14.13) in debug mode;\nThe issue also exists in .NET 8.0 and 9.0","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63596","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Setting rendermode to InteractiveAuto does not use Interactive Server rendering\" (#63596)"},{"Id":"3395755670","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-09T03:54:06","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"63590","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0] Make sure .pdb for AspnetcoreCA gets published to symbol server","State":"closed","Body":"Backport of #63587 to release/10.0\r\n\r\n/cc @wtgodbe\r\n\r\n# Make sure .pdb for AspnetcoreCA gets published to symbol server\r\n\r\nEnsures that the .pdb's for the Aspnetcore Custom Action .dll get indexed to symbol server\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n{Detail}\r\n\r\nFixes APIScan issues w/ missing symbols for aspnetcoreCA.dll, which is only distributed via the ANCM .msi's bundled in the hosting bundle\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nAllows debugging the aspnetcore custom action .dll\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n[If yes, specify the version the behavior has regressed from]\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [ ] High\r\n- [ ] Medium\r\n- [x] Low\r\n\r\nJust adds missing symbols to the server\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\n- [x] Manual (required)\r\n- [x] Automated\r\n\r\n## Packaging changes reviewed?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n- [x] N/A\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## When servicing release/2.3\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make necessary changes in eng/PatchConfig.props\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/63590","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/10.0] Make sure .pdb for AspnetcoreCA gets published to symbol server\" (#63590)"},{"Id":"3396288678","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-09T02:11:04","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"63594","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"open","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

The fix changes the schema reference resolution logic from using `AddOpenApiSchemaByReference` to directly creating `OpenApiSchemaReference` objects\r\n\r\nFixes #63503\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers using ASP.NET Core's OpenAPI generation with models containing circular references may experience incomplete or empty schemas in their OpenAPI documents, particularly when the order of properties affects schema processing. We can consider this a follow-on the the circular reference fixes that we included in .NET 10 Preview 7.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [ ] High\r\n- [ ] Medium\r\n- [x] Low\r\n\r\nThis is a targeted fix that only changes the reference creation mechanism without affecting the broader schema generation architecture.

The reason is that in the headless mode the window width is too small and the sidebar UI is hidden. This causes visibility-sensitive properties such as `IWebElement.Text` to return empty strings for hidden elements from the sidebar, causing assertions to fail.\r\n\r\nThe PR solves the issue by explicitly setting the window size for this particular test. We can discuss if the preferred solution is to set the window size globally when creating the test browser in the headless mode. Alternatively, the test could be fixed by using a visibility-independent API such as `IWebElement.GetDomProperty(\"innerText\")` for reading the relevant values. However, using a realistic window size seems more appropriate for an E2E test.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds the `IWebDriver.SetWindowSize` extension method. A few existing cases where window size was manipulated has been refactored to use this method in order to make such cases more discoverable.\r\n\r\nFixes #54497","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/63583","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix NavMenuHighlightsCurrentLocation in headless mode\" (#63583)"},{"Id":"3393649106","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-08T10:42:31","Actor":"ilonatommy","Number":"63582","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0] Quarantine `CanSendAndReceiveUserMessagesUserNameWithPatternIsTreatedAsLiteral`","State":"open","Body":"## Failing Test(s)\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.StackExchangeRedis.Tests.RedisEndToEndTests.CanSendAndReceiveUserMessagesUserNameWithPatternIsTreatedAsLiteral\n\n## Error Message\n\n```text\nSystem.AggregateException : One or more errors occurred.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy. Or authentication to fail if using TLS termination and expecting an https request.\n\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe change was made for security hardening, as the proxy and IP lists weren't being applied in all cases.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n- **Review your deployment topology:**  \n  Ensure that all legitimate proxy servers in front of your app are properly added to `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` in your `ForwardedHeadersOptions` configuration.\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownProxies = { IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_PROXY_IP\") }\n  });\n  ```\n  Or, for a network:\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownNetworks = { new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_NETWORK_IP\"), PREFIX_LENGTH) }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **If you wish to enable previous behavior:**  \n  You may need to relax your configuration, but this is **not recommended** due to security risks. You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

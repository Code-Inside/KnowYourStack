If it causes an assertion to fail (due to missing content, etc) the test will \"fail\" but you will have no way to see that the JS error caused it. If the assertions pass, everything looks good which is a really bad outcome.\r\n\r\nI think chromedriver probably has a way to get logged errors, but if not the E2E tests should register an unhandled error handler on the window so they can propagate this out somehow (maybe into a hidden dom element that the test runner checks at the end).\r\n\r\nAn easy way to reproduce this is to shove a setTimeout that throws an error somewhere in the blazor code (this sample code is from a blazor bug I'm troubleshooting), like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  private insertText(batch: RenderBatch, parent: LogicalElement, childIndex: number, textFrame: RenderTreeFrame) {\r\n    let textContent = batch.frameReader.textContent(textFrame)!;\r\n    if (typeof (textContent) !== \"string\") {\r\n      textContent = \"\";\r\n      window.setTimeout(() => {\r\n        throw new Error(`Found non-string in batch text content with parent ${parent}`);\r\n      }, 1);\r\n    }\r\n    const newTextNode = document.createTextNode(textContent);\r\n    insertLogicalChild(newTextNode, parent, childIndex);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will produce an error in the browser console, but the test will not fail or dump the error to stdout/stderr, even if you sleep before your assertions to give time for the error to fire. If you turn the setTimeout into a regular throw, the test will fail.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198130/167662433-85dfbf4b-3340-4658-b108-24688849e0b9.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198130/167662699-37b76708-f19b-4a3b-8d29-28d27c3188ae.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41607","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"E2E tests ignore javascript errors\" (#41607)"},{"Id":"1231309622","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-10T15:07:11","Actor":"thepra","Number":"41606","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't update to packages to 6.0.5, issues with System.IO.Pipelines supporting >= 6.0.3","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI was trying to update this Blazor libraries:\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer\r\n\r\nto 6.0.5 but the following nuget package resolution is blocking the update:\r\n\r\nGravità\tCodice\tDescrizione\tProgetto\tFile\tRiga\tStato eliminazione\r\nErrore\tNU1103\tA stable package was not found for System.IO.Pipelines with version (>= 6.0.3)\r\n  - Found version 63 in nuget.org [ Versione più vicina: 7.0.0-preview.1.22076.8 ]\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMake the update to 6.0.5 of the libraries\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nHave a Blazor WASM Hosted project with current packages on 6.0.3 on the client side\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.202\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41606","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't update to packages to 6.0.5, issues with System.IO.Pipelines supporting >= 6.0.3\" (#41606)"},{"Id":"1231164306","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-10T13:28:54","Actor":"douglassimaodev","Number":"41604","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor webassembly Hosting Problem","State":"open","Body":"Hi, \r\n\r\nI know we can find a lot of post about this here but none solve my problem..\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\nCreate new blazor webassembly with PWA support, framework 6.0\r\nEither SPA or asp.net Hosted (no authentication)\r\n\r\nWhen I simply publish it and copy the files over to IIS server folder\r\nHTTPS configured via LetsEncrypt\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I open in Chrome for the first time all fine, then when I try to reload it, either by hitting F5 or from reload in chrome then I get the error:\r\nFailed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource 'https://xxxxxx/_framework/dotnet.6.0.0.w1ug730vgp.js' with computed SHA-256 integrity 'GypavvZZdIRFqAx5L67eifOe8jYJHMy0tA6zNnh8t18='.

We get the error \r\n\"ERROR ( message:Cannot find requested collection element. )\" \r\nWhat are we doing wrong?\r\n\r\nappcmd.exe set config \"MyWebSite\" -section:appSettings /[key='MyFlag1'].value:\"true\"\r\n\r\nWe use IIS 7.5.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpect this command to change the MyFlag1 appsetting value to true in my appsettings.json\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1) Create a asp.net core app with appsettings.json\r\n\r\n2) Let there be the following json entry in your appsettings.json\r\n\"MyFlag1\": false\r\n\r\n3) Add a website named \"MyWebSite\" pointing to this app.\r\n\r\n4) Run the following command\r\n%windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set config \"MyWebSite\" -section:appSettings /[key='MyFlag1'].value:\"true\"\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nERROR ( message:Cannot find requested collection element. )\n\n### .NET Version\n\nAspNetCore.App 5.0.10   NetCore.app.5.0.10\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41596","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to read appsettings using appcmd.exe\" (#41596)"},{"Id":"1230150640","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-09T20:12:24","Actor":"salghazaly","Number":"41594","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor Css Isolation Is Not Recognized in Maui-Blazor WinUI Application","State":"closed","Body":"Hi, this is a known issue and is fixed in the upcoming preview 7 update.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @Eilon in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/35195#issuecomment-895599806_\r\n\r\nI have faced this issue in the candidate release also\r\nI think it's not solved yet ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41594","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blazor Css Isolation Is Not Recognized in Maui-Blazor WinUI Application\" (#41594)"},{"Id":"1230157266","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-09T19:30:54","Actor":"michaelgwelch","Number":"41595","RawContent":null,"Title":"The openapi2client (Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi) complains about boolean valued required key on header object of OpenAPI spec","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe `openapi2client` client throws an exception when you use the `required` key on a [header object](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#header-object) with a boolean value\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPer the spec:\r\n\r\n> The Header Object follows the structure of the [Parameter Object](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#parameterObject) with the following changes:\r\n> \r\n> 1. name MUST NOT be specified, it is given in the corresponding headers map.\r\n> 1. in MUST NOT be specified, it is implicitly in header.\r\n> 1. All traits that are affected by the location MUST be applicable to a location of header (for example, [style](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#parameterStyle)).\r\n\r\nAnd the [parameter](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#fixed-fields-9) defines the `required` key as such:\r\n\r\n> required | boolean | Determines whether this parameter is mandatory. If the parameter locationis \"path\", this property is REQUIRED and its value MUST be true. Otherwise, the property MAY be included and its default value is false.\r\n> -- | -- | --\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe repo https://github.com/michaelgwelch/petstore2 demonstrates a header named `CUSTOM` with `required` set to `true`. If you attempt to build you will get an exception.\r\n\r\nIf you remove the `required` key then it should build fine. This indicates it's the `required` key causing the issue.

have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe spec I'm using uses a [specification extension](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#specification-extensions) under [path item objects](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#path-item-object).\r\n\r\nWhen I run a build after adding an OpenAPI Reference, NewtonSoft throws an exception when it hits this extension. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAs OpenAPI allows for specification extensions, the tooling to process a spec should quietly ignore any extension is doesn't know about. Therefore the client generation should succeed.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn this repo (which is not an asp.net application, it's a simple console app) you will find an OpenAPI spec with the key `x-visibility` under `/pets` path. \r\n\r\nThis should be allowed but your parser complains.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet build\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 17.1.1+a02f73656 for .NET\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change. Optionally, there are changes to your application that you may consider to work around this change if it impacts your application:\r\n\r\n* [`ActivatorUtilitiesConstructorAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilitiesconstructorattribute) can be applied to constructor to specify an exact constructor to use.\r\n* Application developers may register an implementation of `IComponentActivator` in the DI container that reverts to the .NET 6 behavior.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nComponent constructors","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/482","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default\" (#482)"},{"Id":"1190169916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-01T19:03:58","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"484","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThe mechanism to detect an empty request `body` during the MVC Model Binding now uses the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody), that is currently implemented by the following behavior:\r\n\r\n- `true` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with a non-zero `Content-Length` or a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that did not set the `END_STREAM` flag on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\n- `false` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with no `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header, or the `Content-Length` is `0`.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with `Connection: Upgrade` (e.g. WebSockets). There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

Eg.:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-0f87920dc675fdfdf8d7638d3be66577-bd6bdbf32d21b714-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"\": [\r\n+      \"A non-empty request body is required.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"value\": [\r\n      \"The value field is required.\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is an alignment with other parts of the framework that were already using the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody) and also a fix to a reported issue dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29570\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nNo change is required, however, if you getting an unexpected behavior is recommended to review if your client's requests are sending the appropriated headers/information.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC Action Controllers","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/484","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding\" (#484)"},{"Id":"1154726545","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T01:08:45","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"483","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Event IDs for some Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core log messages changed","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs part of updating the Microsoft.AspNetcore.Mvc.Core assembly to use `LoggerMessageAttribute`, we discovered logger event Ids being reused within a single log category.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

View types are augmented with the `internal sealed` modifiers by default and included under the `AspNetCoreGeneratedDocument` namespace.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change improves build performance for applications that use Razor views by removing the two-step compilation process and also allows Razor views to participate in the hot reload experience for VS.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n \r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/459","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Razor compiler no longer produces a Views assembly\" (#459)"},{"Id":"850544376","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-05T17:57:32","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"458","RawContent":null,"Title":"Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation","State":"open","Body":"## Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation\r\n\r\nThe extension method `EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.AddDataAnnotationsValidation` is being marked as obsolete. Developers should use the new extension method `EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.EnableDataAnnotationsValidation` instead.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between these two APIs is in their return values:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nEditContext AddDataAnnotationsValidation(this EditContext editContext) { ... }\r\n\r\nIDisposable EnableDataAnnotationsValidation(this EditContext editContext) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe older API returns its `EditContext` (as a kind of fluent API).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new API returns an `IDisposable` whose disposal can be used to remove the data annotations validation support from the `EditContext`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThere are cases where it's desirable to remove the data annotations validation support after adding it. This was not possible with the older API because there was no place to store the internal event subscriptions. The new API returns an object that holds the state necessary to remove data annotations validation support on disposal.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\n**This does not affect most applications, because most applications do not call this directly anyway.** Most applications instead use the `<DataAnnotationsValidator>` component, and do not need to be changed. The use of the extension methods discussed here is a rare and advanced case.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you do call `editContext.AddDataAnnotationsValidation()`, then replace that call with `editContext.EnableDataAnnotationsValidation()`.

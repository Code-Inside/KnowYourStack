Please describe the problem.\n\nUI's with many components like lists, trees and tables can perform really bad, because too many components gets rendered at every update. The Blazor change detecting easily gets thrown off because of event handlers like:\n\n```\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <Item OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(item))\">Click me</Item>\n}\n```\n\nBecause the event handler is a new delegate object each render the whole Item component also gets rendered.\nOne fix is to implement ShouldRender in the Item component, but that gets really tedious.\n\nI have made my own RenderBlocker component that simply takes a Key and uses it to evaluate if a new render is needed. Internally it uses ShouldRender and compares the Key to previous render.\n\nUsed like this:\n\n```\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <RenderBlocker Key=\"@item\">\n        <Item OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(item))\">Click me</Item>\n    </RenderBlocker>\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe suggestion is to add a @renderkey to the razor syntax that behaves exactly like my custom RenderBlocker component.\n\n```\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <Item @renderkey=\"@item\" OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(item))\">Click me</Item>\n}\n```\n\nMaybe extended with custom comparer:\n```\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <Item @renderkey=\"@item\" @renderkey:comparer=\"@MyComparer\" OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(item))\">Click me</Item>\n}\n```\n\nBecause item is the same as last render, the whole component is re-used. (And also sub components)\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nNote that the existing @key doesn't solve this issue, but my suggestion with @renderkey follows a similar syntax.\n\nThe code for RenderBlocker in case anyone needs it:\n```\n@typeparam TKey\n\n@ChildContent\n\n@code {\n\t[Parameter]\n\tpublic RenderFragment?

This was a silent failure that led to confusing behavior.\n\n```javascript\n// This now throws instead of causing double-triggering:\nBlazor.registerCustomEventType('scrolltop', { \n    browserEventName: 'scrolltop'  // ❌ Error: names must differ\n});\n\n// Correct usage:\nBlazor.registerCustomEventType('customscroll', { \n    browserEventName: 'scrolltop'  // ✅ Works as expected\n});\n```\n\n**Changes:**\n- Added validation in `registerCustomEventType` to throw when `eventName === options.browserEventName`\n- Added E2E test covering the error case\n- Error message guides developers to choose a different custom event name\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for details)</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> -

This forces developers to wrap disposal in try-catch blocks.\n\n**Changes:**\n\n- Modified `JSObjectReference.DisposeAsync()` to catch and suppress `JSDisconnectedException` \n- Added tests verifying exception suppression on single and multiple dispose calls\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nIf JS is disconnected, the JS-side object is already gone. Server-side disposal would fail regardless, so the exception provides no value and only creates noise.\n\n**Before:**\n```csharp\npublic async ValueTask DisposeAsync()\n{\n    if (_jsModule is not null)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            await _jsModule.DisposeAsync();\n        }\n        catch (JSDisconnectedException)\n        {\n            // Must manually catch in every component\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n```csharp\npublic async ValueTask DisposeAsync()\n{\n    if (_jsModule is not null)\n    {\n        await _jsModule.DisposeAsync(); // No try-catch needed\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n\n<issue_title>Change IJSObjectReference.Dispose specifically so that it deals with catching and discarding JSDisconnectedException internally</issue_title>\n<issue_description>I'm getting a warning and exception when trying to dispose a JavaScript module reference in a component's DisposeAsync method when the component is using the server interactive render mode.\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n- Install .NET 8 Preview 6\r\n- Clone https://github.com/danroth27/BestForYouRecipes and pull the [dotnet8](https://github.com/danroth27/BestForYouRecipes/tree/dotnet8) branch\r\n- Make sure BestForYouRecipes/Pages/SubmitRecipe.razor is setup to use the server render mode for the recipe editor\r\n- Build and run the app\r\n- Browse to the Submit Recipe page\r\n- Browse back to the home page of the app\r\n\r\nExpected result: No exception\r\nActual result: JSDisconnectedException\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.Circuits.RemoteRenderer[100]\r\n      Unhandled exception rendering component: JavaScript interop calls cannot be issued at this time.

The component is trying to do a JS interop call after the browser connection has been closed, so it should throw this exception. You do need to catch it. This isn't specific to .NET 8 - the same thing would happen on .NET 7 if a user closes their browser tab or navigates to an external site.\r\n\r\nI see that the usability here is quite poor though. One thing we could do is change `IJSObjectReference.Dispose` specifically so that it deals with catching and discarding `JSDisconnectedException` internally. It would be safe to do since if JS is disconnected, then there's no reason why the server should be concerned about disposing `IJSObjectReference` instances.</bod...\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n- Fixes dotnet/aspnetcore#49418\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64773","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Suppress JSDisconnectedException in IJSObjectReference.DisposeAsync\" (#64773)"},{"Id":"3729704549","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-15T13:52:46","Actor":"akoeplinger","Number":"64769","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix repository URL in Microsoft.JSInterop.JS","State":"closed","Body":"We were still referencing the old dotnet/extensions location.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64769","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix repository URL in Microsoft.JSInterop.JS\" (#64769)"},{"Id":"3730554021","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-15T13:52:38","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"64772","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add cancel event support to InputFile component","State":"open","Body":"# Add cancel event support to InputFile component\n\n- [x] You've read the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).\n- [x] You've included unit or integration tests for your change, where applicable.\n- [x] You've included inline docs for your change, where applicable.\n- [x] There's an open issue for the PR that you are making.

Now implements the standard dispose pattern with a protected virtual method.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Add `protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)` method containing disposal logic\n- Update `IDisposable.Dispose()` to call `Dispose(true)`\n- Add unit test verifying derived classes can override disposal behavior\n- Update public API surface\n\n**Pattern follows:**\n```csharp\nprotected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)\n{\n    if (disposing)\n    {\n        _jsCallbacksRelay?.Dispose();\n    }\n}\n\nvoid IDisposable.Dispose()\n{\n    Dispose(disposing: true);\n}\n```\n\nDerived classes can now override `Dispose(bool)` without reflection, consistent with `InputBase` and `ValidationMessage`.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>[Blazor] InputFile should implement dispose pattern</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>I implemented a derived class of InputFile for handling the cancel event (see also https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58118).\n> I had to use reflection to dispose `_jsCallbacksRelay`.

Happy to provide additional debugging information or test potential fixes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`Handlebars.Compile()` should be callable indefinitely without causing browser hangs, consistent with behavior in:\n- .NET 8 Blazor WASM\n- .NET 10 server-side / console applications\n- Debug builds\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```csharp\n// Minimal reproduction - Blazor WASM page\n@page \"/\"\n@using HandlebarsDotNet\n\n<h1>Handlebars WASM Hang Test</h1>\n<p>Iterations: @_count</p>\n<button @onclick=\"RunTest\">Start Test</button>\n\n@code {\n    private int _count;\n    private static readonly IHandlebars Hb = Handlebars.Create();\n\n    private async Task RunTest()\n    {\n        while (true)\n        {\n            _count++;\n\n            // This call eventually hangs the browser\n            var template = Hb.Compile(\"Hello {{name}}!\");\n            var result = template(new { name = \"World\" });\n\n            StateHasChanged();\n            await Task.Delay(1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Critical:** Must be tested as a **published Release build**:\n```bash\ndotnet publish -c Release\ncd bin/Release/net10.0/publish/wwwroot\nnpx http-server -p 8080 -c-1\n# Open http://localhost:8080\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nNone\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.101\n\n### Anything else?\n\n**Investigation findings:**\n\nThrough extensive debugging with skip flags at various points in the compilation pipeline, we identified that the hang occurs during the creation of `HandlebarsConfigurationAdapter` in `HandlebarsEnvironment.Compile()`. Specifically:\n\n1. The adapter constructor performs significant work including:\n   - LINQ operations (`.Select()`, `.OrderBy()`, `.ToList()`)\n   - Reflection (`.GetTypeInfo().GetCustomAttribute<>()`)\n   - Feature creation via `CreateFeature()`\n   - Observable collection setup with subscriptions\n\n2. A workaround that caches the configuration adapter (avoiding recreation on each compile) delays but does not fully prevent the hang.\n\n**Attempted mitigations (none resolved the issue):**\n- `<WasmEnableJiterpreter>false</WasmEnableJiterpreter>`\n- `<TieredPGO>false</TieredPGO>`\n- `<RunAOTCompilation>false</RunAOTCompilation>`\n- `<WasmEnableWebcil>false</WasmEnableWebcil>`\n- `<WasmBuildNative>false</WasmBuildNative>`\n- `<RunWasmOpt>false</RunWasmOpt>`\n- `<BlazorWebAssemblyEnableLinking>false</BlazorWebAssemblyEnableLinking>`\n- `<PublishTrimmed>false</PublishTrimmed>`\n\n[handlebars-wasm-hang-repro.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24146019/handlebars-wasm-hang-repro.zip)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64765","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \".NET 10 Blazor WASM hang\" (#64765)"},{"Id":"3726833697","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-14T06:12:43","Actor":"furaquejohn11","Number":"64767","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi request problem in version 10+","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nSo i often used vertical slice architecture in all of my project and then I noticed that if there are the same request in the same namespace, even though they are under the different class, it only shows all identical copies to all endpoints.

generating output file path","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n### Description\n\nThe GetDocumentInsider CLI tool constructs the output file path using a user-provided\n`documentName` value.\n\nAlthough a sanitized version of this value is computed internally, the final output\nfile name is built using the original, unsanitized input. As a result, directory\nseparators or traversal sequences (e.g. `../` or `..\\`) can influence the generated\nfile path.\n\nThis allows a crafted `documentName` value to escape the intended output directory\nand cause files to be written to unintended locations.\n\nThis issue was previously reported to MSRC (VULN-168240) and was classified as a\nnon-serviciable security case.\n\n---\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Run the GetDocumentInsider CLI tool with a specified `--output` directory.\n2. Provide a `documentName` containing directory traversal sequences, such as:\n   - `a/../b`\n   - `a\\..\\b`\n3. Observe that the generated output file path may be influenced by these sequences\n   instead of being treated as a plain file name.\n\n---\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe output file path should always be derived from a sanitized version of\n`documentName`, with no possibility for directory traversal or subdirectory creation.\n\n---\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe sanitized value is computed but not used when constructing the output file path.\n\n---\n\n### Affected code\n\n`src/Tools/GetDocumentInsider/src/Commands/GetDocumentCommandWorker.cs`  \nMethod: `GetDocumentPath(...)`\n\n---\n\n### Proposed fix\n\nUse the sanitized document name when generating the output file path and treat\ndirectory separators consistently across platforms.\n\n---\n\n### Additional context\n\nA fix and regression test have already been prepared and will be submitted in a\nfollow-up pull request.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe generated output file should always be created inside the specified output\ndirectory, using a sanitized version of `documentName` that cannot influence the\nresulting file path.\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nNo separate repro project is required. The issue can be reproduced directly by\ninvoking the GetDocumentInsider CLI tool with a crafted `documentName` value, as\ndescribed above.\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

As well as [HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder) and [Introducing WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model) for migration guides.\n\nBelow is an example of converting `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder`:\n\n**Before**\n```csharp\nvar hostBuilder = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup()\n    .UseKestrel();\n// Test code might use TestServer:\nvar testServer = new TestServer(hostBuilder);\n```\n\n**After**\n```csharp\nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseTestServer() // If using TestServer\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\nawait host.StartAsync();\n\nvar testServer = host.GetTestServer();\n```\n\nBoth Copilot and ChatGpt have given good results so far when asked to convert a WebHostBuilder example to use HostBuilder.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\",

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior. Alternatively, set the `MICROSOFT_ASPNETCORE_HTTPOVERRIDES_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_PROXIES_WITHOUT_FOR` environment variable.\n\n> [!Note]\n> In cloud environments, the proxy IP(s) can change over the lifetime of the app and `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` is sometimes used to make forwarded headers work.\n\n### References\n\n- [Forwarded Headers Middleware documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer)\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n`UseForwardedHeaders();`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/517","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Forwarded Headers Middleware Now Ignores X-Forwarded-* Headers from Unknown Proxies\" (#517)"},{"Id":"2662868601","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T18:59:39","Actor":"maraf","Number":"516","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nIn previous versions of Blazor WebAssembly, legacy Mono and Emscripten APIs were exported to global namespace. \r\nFrom 9.0 those APIs are accessible throught Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 9 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nLegacy Mono (MONO, BINDING) and Emscripten Module object was exported to global window object.\r\nFor example `window.Module.FS` returned emscripten virtual filesystem.\n\n### New behavior\n\nEmscripten Module object is now exported to `Blazor.runtime` object.\r\nFor example `Blazor.runtime.Module.FS` returns emscripten virtual filesystem.\r\nLegacy Mono API for interop was removed completely (MONO and BINDING) and replaced with JSImport/JSExport.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe general goal is not to polute global namespace and keep all the APIs accessible from single Blazor object.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nReplace accessing Emscripten APIs from window object to Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nwindow.MONO.*\r\nwindow.BINDING.*\r\nwindow.Module.*","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/516","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications\" (#516)"},{"Id":"2606573022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-22T21:39:01","Actor":"amcasey","Number":"515","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: dev cert export no longer creates folder","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nWhen you export the ASP.NET Core development certificate (used to enable https in local development), it will no longer create the directory into which the certificate is being exported, if that directory doesn’t already exist.\r\n\r\nThis change first appears in 8.0.10 and 9.0 RC1.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 8 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```\r\ndotnet dev-certs https -ep C:\\NonExistent\\cert.pfx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `C:\\NonExistent\\` did not exist when the command was run, it would be created (with permissions inherited from the containing directory).\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe target directory must exist or the export will fail with a message like `There was an error exporting the HTTPS developer certificate to a file.`\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe development certificate is exported with its private key, so unauthorized access can be very problematic.

It can be set directly or by registering a provider in the Dependency Injection container.\r\n\r\n`TimeProvider` does not truncate to the nearest second, consumers are expected to correctly format the time as needed.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nUnifying the time abstraction across the stack for easier testing.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nComponents that derive from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SecurityStampValidator<TUser>` should remove their `ISystemClock` constructor parameter and call the new base constructor accordingly. Similarly, derived implementations that reference the `Clock` property on these types should reference the new `TimeProvider` property instead. `TimeProvider` is now settable for testing on the options or via DI.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder, ISystemClock clock)\r\n-        : base(options, logger, encoder, clock)\r\n+    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder)\r\n+        : base(options, logger, encoder)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-       var currentUtc = Clock.UtcNow;\r\n+       var currentUtc = TimeProvider.GetUtcNow();\r\n```\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- [`ISystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.isystemclock)\r\n- [`SystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.systemclock)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>.Clock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1.clock)\r\n- [`CookieAuthenticationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationhandler)\r\n- [`FacebookHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.facebook.facebookhandler)\r\n- [`GoogleHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.google.googlehandler)\r\n- [`JwtBearerHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.jwtbearerhandler)\r\n- [`MicrosoftAccountHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.microsoftaccount.microsoftaccounthandler)\r\n- [`NegotiateHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.negotiate.negotiatehandler)\r\n- [`OAuthHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.oauth.oauthhandler-1)\r\n- [`OpenIdConnectHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.openidconnect.openidconnecthandler)\r\n- [`PolicySchemeHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.policyschemehandler)\r\n- [`RemoteAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.remoteauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignInAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signinauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignOutAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signoutauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`TwitterHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.twitter.twitterhandler)\r\n- [`WsFederationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.wsfederation.wsfederationhandler)\r\n- [`SecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.securitystampvalidator-1)\r\n- [`TwoFactorSecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.twofactorsecuritystampvalidator-1)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/505","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider\" (#505)"},{"Id":"1661290568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T20:06:20","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"504","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` no longer use custom converters","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nPrior to .NET 8 Preview 2, `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` type used custom converters to support JSON serialization due to a lack of support for the `IgnoreNullValues` option.

Create a new Blazor WebAssembly app (no hosting .NET 8):\n```bash\ndotnet new blazorwasm -n DevCertRepro\n```\nOr create new project through UI.\n\n2. Open the generated .csproj and change:\n```xml\n<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n```\n\nto:\n```xml\n<TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>\n```\n\n3. Do not update any NuGet packages yet.\n\n4. Ensure a dev cert exists:\n```bash\ndotnet dev-certs https --clean\ndotnet dev-certs https --trust\ndotnet dev-certs https --check\n```\n\nOutput: valid CN=localhost dev cert (IsHttpsDevelopmentCertificate: true).\n\n5. Run the project with the default Development profile:\n```bash\ndotnet run --project DevCertRepro/DevCertRepro.csproj --launch-profile Development\n```\n\n✅ Result: dev server starts, HTTPS endpoint is configured correctly, app runs on https://localhost:<port>.\n\n6. Now update NuGet packages (either via IDE or CLI). For example:\n```\ndotnet list DevCertRepro/DevCertRepro.csproj package --outdated\n# Then update, either with `dotnet add package` or \"Update all\" in the IDE\n```\n\nBefore upgrade, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer version was:\n```xml\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer\" Version=\"8.0.15\" PrivateAssets=\"all\"/>\n```\n\nAfter upgrade, it becomes:\n```xml\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer\" Version=\"10.0.1\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />\n```\n\n7. Run again with the same command:\n```bash\ndotnet run --project DevCertRepro/DevCertRepro.csproj --launch-profile Development\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Unable to configure HTTPS endpoint. No server certificate was specified, and the default developer certificate could not be found or is out of date.\nTo generate a developer certificate run 'dotnet dev-certs https'.

Explicit Kestrel certificate configuration\n\nAdding the following environment variables to the launch profile makes the dev server start successfully with HTTPS:\n```json\n\"ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\<user>\\\\.aspnet\\\\https\\\\blazor-dev.pfx\",\n\"ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password\": \"<password>\"\n```\nwhere blazor-dev.pfx is exported via:\n```bash\ndotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\\.aspnet\\https\\blazor-dev.pfx -p <password>\ndotnet dev-certs https --trust\n```\nThis bypasses the “default developer certificate” lookup and works reliably.\n\nI have done this process for two different apps/solutions where upgrading to .NET 10 from 8 breaks local https server.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64731","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor WebAssembly DevServer fails to use development HTTPS certificate after NuGet package upgrade\" (#64731)"},{"Id":"3716943199","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:07:12","Actor":"avanigupta","Number":"64730","RawContent":null,"Title":"Percent encoding of query string parameters","State":"open","Body":"My service uses the following APIs to add URL query strings:\n[QueryHelpers.AddQueryString](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.webutilities.queryhelpers.addquerystring?view=aspnetcore-8.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-webutilities-queryhelpers-addquerystring(system-string-system-string-system-string)) and [QueryBuilder.Add](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.extensions.querybuilder.add?view=aspnetcore-8.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-extensions-querybuilder-add(system-string-system-string)) \n\nAccording to [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-2.2), I'm expecting all the reserved characters to be percent-encoded.

The webapp project includes common as a dependency which includes any of its assets under /_content/common/etc...\n\nThere are also some assets that are duplicated in the main webapp's wwwroot directory because they were used outside of the common project's views. (this duplication happened due to refactoring over time)\n\nPrior to upgrading .netcore yesterday this setup ran without issue. Now the same builds fail with \"Conflicting assets with the same target path\" which it should not do because the common project (should produce) outputs to its own location.\n\nAfter investigating, that no longer seems to be the case.\nInstead of `/_content/common/font/Calibri.ttf`  I'm finding the contents provided by the common project are being sent to `/font/Calibri.ttf` (along with everything else form its wwwroot directory.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nRegardless of if they have the same relative path and name, the combined output should be:\n\n```\n/font/Calibri.ttf\n/_content/common/font/Calibri.ttf\n```\n\nThere shouldn't be a conflict here.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nExample Webapp csproj:\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\n\n  <PropertyGroup Label=\"Configuration\" Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'\">\n    <TypeScriptTarget>ES2021</TypeScriptTarget>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <PropertyGroup Label=\"Configuration\" Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'\">\n    <TypeScriptTarget>ES2021</TypeScriptTarget>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp8.0</TargetFramework>\n    <RootNamespace>unison_webapp</RootNamespace>\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n    <SignAssembly>False</SignAssembly>\n    <GenerateAssemblyInfo>False</GenerateAssemblyInfo>\n    <StartupObject>webapp.Program</StartupObject>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n\t  <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\common\\common.csproj\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n\t<None Include=\"wwwroot\\**\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\nExample Common csproj:\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\n    <PropertyGroup>\n        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n        <RootNamespace>common</RootNamespace>\n        <SolutionDir Condition=\"$(SolutionDir) == '' Or $(SolutionDir) == '*Undefined*'\">..\\webapp\\</SolutionDir>\n        <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n        <SignAssembly>False</SignAssembly>\n        <OutputType>Library</OutputType>\n        <ImportWindowsDesktopTargets>false</ImportWindowsDesktopTargets>\n    </PropertyGroup>\n\n    <ItemGroup>\n        <Compile Remove=\"packages\\**\" />\n        <EmbeddedResource Remove=\"packages\\**\" />\n        <None Remove=\"packages\\**\" />\n        <Content Remove=\"packages.config\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n\n    <ItemGroup>\n\t\t<None Include=\"wwwroot\\**\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n\n```\n\nIntended folder structure is:\n```\n[solution directory]\n   /webapp\n       /webapp\n           /wwwroot\n               /font\n                   /testfile.txt\n   /common\n      /common\n         /wwwroot\n             /font\n                 /testfile.txt\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\nRider version:\n```\nJetBrains Rider 2025.3.0.3\nBuild #RD-253.28294.237, built on November 26, 2025\nSource revision: 45206b7806fea\n```\n\nThe output of `dotnet --info`:\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100\n Commit:            b0f34d51fc\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.4c0ca8ba\n MSBuild version:   18.0.2+b0f34d51f\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     manjaro\n OS Version:  \n OS Platform: Linux\n RID:         linux-x64\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/10.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\nNo workload sets are installed.

In these default cases, the `NavigateTo` API works correctly.\n\nHowever there's also an obscure way to disable both of these via config. It's niche, but it's supported, so the rest of the system should work with that. Unfortunately `NavigateTo` assumes that either enhanced nav or an interactive router will be enabled and doesn't account for the case when neither is.\n\nFixes #51636\n\n## Customer Impact\n\nWithout this fix, anyone who uses the `ssr: { disableDomPreservation: true }` config option will be unable to use the `NavigateTo` API, as it will do nothing. This behavior isn't desirable.\n\n## Regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\nNo because existing code can't use `ssr: { disableDomPreservation: true }` as the option didn't exist prior to .NET 8.\n\nSomeone else might argue that it's a regression in the sense that, if you're migrating existing code to use newer .NET 8 patterns (and are using `disableDomPreservation` for some reason, even though you wouldn't normally), your existing uses of `NavigateTo` could stop working. That's not how we normally define \"regression\" but I'm trying to give the fullest explanation.\n\n## Risk\n\n- [ ] High\n- [ ] Medium\n- [x] Low\n\nThe fix explicitly retains the old code path if you're coming from .NET 7 or earlier (i.e., if you are using `blazor.webassembly/server/webview.js`. The fixed code path is only applied in `blazor.web.js`, so it should not affect existing apps that are simply moving to the `net8.0` TFM without other code changes.\n\n## Verification\n\n- [x] Manual (required)\n- [x] Automated\n\n## Packaging changes reviewed?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [ ] No\n- [x] N/A\n\n----\n\n## When servicing release/10.0\n\n- [ ] Make necessary changes in eng/PatchConfig.props","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64724","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[10.0] [Blazor] Support NavigateTo when enhanced nav is disabled (#52267)\" (#64724)"},{"Id":"3714753693","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-10T11:16:34","Actor":"aelij","Number":"64723","RawContent":null,"Title":"Kestrel throws when specifying `*` IP binding on OS without IPv6 support","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n.NET 10 added a new check when setting `Socket.DualMode = true` that throws a `PlatformNotSupportedException` if the underlying OS doesn't support IPv6.\n\nThis causes Kestrel to throw when specifying listen URLs such as `https://*:443`.

This comes from `GetOpenApiServers` method, which relies on `UriHelper.BuildAbsolute()`. That helper always appends a trailing slash.\n> \n> According to the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification (section 4.8.5.2), the server URLs in the examples is shown without a trailing slash. Because of the current behavior, the generated document doesn’t align with the expected format.\n> \n> The issue shows up immediately after adding `AddOpenApi()` with no extra configuration: the generated document contains https://example.com/ instead of https://example.com\n> \n> ### Expected Behavior\n> \n> `servers.url` should be generated without a trailing slash, matching the example from the specification.\n> \n> ### Steps To Reproduce\n> \n> Steps:\n> 1. Create a ASP.NET Core project (minimal api / web api).\n> 2. Register OpenAPI using `AddOpenApi()`.\n> 3. Open the generated document.\n> 4.

Please describe the problem.\n\nAccording to the [SignalR documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/hubs?view=aspnetcore-9.0#handle-errors), when throwing a `HubException` from a hub method, SignalR should \"[send] the entire exception message to the client, unmodified.\" However, the actual behavior wraps the message:\n```\n// Server\nthrow new HubException(\"{\\\"code\\\":0}\");\n\n// Client receives\n\"An unexpected error occurred invoking 'MethodName' on the server. HubException: {\\\"code\\\":0}\"\n```\nThis is caused by `ErrorMessageHelper.BuildErrorMessage()` which - in the case of `HubException` - formats the message as:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/a9aaa320f1c4c771b2dee8c000409a5f04397339/src/SignalR/server/Core/src/Internal/ErrorMessageHelper.cs#L10-L13\n\nThis occurs when throwing the exception from a hub method and from a filter.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe `HubException.Message` should be passed through unmodified to the client, as documented.\n\nAlternatively, update the documentation to clarify this behaviour.\n\n### Additional context\n\nHere is a sample use-case:\n\nPassing JSON error payloads to clients:\n```\n// Server\nthrow new HubException(\"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"USER_NOT_FOUND\\\"}\");\n\n// Client receives\n\"An unexpected error occurred invoking 'GetUser' on the server.

CDP and AIA may point to untrusted or dynamic endpoints, services must explicitly manage certificate chain building and revocation checking. Thus this approach of offline client certificate validation mitigates risks such as server-side request forgery (SSRF) and ensures that CRLs are retrieved only from vetted, secure sources. \n\nFor these services to perform certificate chain building offline during client certificate validation to maintain full control over the trust anchors and intermediate certificates involved in the process. it is possible thanks to the API exposed by .NET as in the following example \n```csharp\nbool TryOfflineBuildChian(X509Certificate clientCertificate, out X509Chain chain)\n{\n    chain = new X509Chain\n    {\n        ChainPolicy = {\n            DisableCertificateDownloads = true,\n            TrustMode = X509ChainTrustMode.CustomRootTrust,\n            RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.NoCheck\n        }\n    };\n    chain.ChainPolicy.CustomTrustStore.Add(rootCert);\n    chain.ChainPolicy.ExtraStore.Add(intermediateCert);\n    \n    return chain.Build(clientCertificate);\n}\n```\n\nHowever, while it allows for greater control over chain construction, .NET currently lacks built-in APIs for manually validating CRLs outside the X509Chain and without depending on Bouncy Castle or platform-specific libraries like Windows CAPI. Both Bouncy Castle and Windows CAPI offers essential features such building a CRL from bytes, enumerating revoked serial numbers, verifying CRL signatures with a public key, and obtain CRL's files such as ThisUpdate and NextUpdate , capabilities crucial for services that need to conduct revocation checks in a strictly controlled and platform-independent manner. By introducing similar functionalities in .NET for manual CRL validation, services would gain the ability to maintain strict control over certificate trust decisions without relying on external libraries or foreign function interfaces which are a bottleneck for the performances. \n\nUsing Bouncy Castle it is possible to write the following code \n\n```csharp\nX509Certificate2 issuerCert; /* issuer CA certificate */\nUri crlEndpoint= GetTrustedCrlDistributionPoint(issuerCert);\n\nbyte[] crlBytes = DownloadCrl(crlEndpoint); /* CRL bytes */\n\nX509CrlParser parser = new X509CrlParser();\nX509Crl crl = parser.ReadCrl(crlBytes);\n\n\n// Validate issuer and signature\nvar issuerBc = DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(issuerCert2);\nif (!crl.Verify(issuerBc.GetPublicKey()))\n    throw new CryptographicException(\"CRL is not issued by the given certificate (DN/signature mismatch).\");\n\n// Enumerate revoked\nforeach (X509CrlEntry entry in crl.GetRevokedCertificates())\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(entry);\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, exposing properties such as ThisUpdate, NextUpdate, and the list of revoked certificates empowers services handling high RPS traffic, requiring SubjectName/Issuer validation on each request, to implement efficient certificate revocation verification mechanisms.\nFor example, instead of relying on standard CRL validation par of the X509Chian during each request, which typically involves downloading and parsing CRLs from remote endpoints, these services could perform rapid in-memory lookups using optimized data structures and caches. These caches are indexed to quickly identify whether a client certificate has been revoked, significantly reducing latency and eliminating network dependencies after the initial CRL download.\n\nThe logic executed by these processes can be summarized as:\n```csharp\nbool IsCertificateValid(X509Certificate clientCertificate)\n{\n    if (TryOfflineBuildChian(clientCertificate, out X509Chain chain))\n    {\n        foreach (var element in chain.ChainElements)\n        {\n            var issuer = element.Certificate.Issuer;\n            var crl = CrlCache.Get(issuer);\n\n            if (crl == null)\n            {\n                var url = GetTrustedCrlDistributionPoint(element.Certificate);\n                var crlBytes = DownloadCrl(url);\n                crl = ParseCrlAndValidateSignature(crlBytes, issuer);\n                CrlCache.Set(issuer, crl);\n            }\n\n            if (crl.IsRevoked(element.Certificate.SerialNumber))\n                return false;\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nFurthermore, given the nature of high-volume services, it's essential for developers to have control over throttling and retry mechanisms when downloading CRLs. For example, they may need to define how the service behaves when a CRL distribution endpoint is unavailable, or implement throttling strategies to avoid unintentionally overwhelming the endpoint, potentially causing a denial-of-service scenarios. These considerations are especially important in distributed systems and cloud-native architectures, where reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance are critical and every services weights differently each of this characteristics. Providing developers with fine-grained control over the CRL allows them to build robust and predictable revocation checking under varying network and load conditions.\n\n## Proposed API\n\nIntroduce a the following objects `X509CertificateRevocationList`, `X509CertificateRevocationListRevocationEntry`, `X509CertificateRevocationListLoader`.\n\n```diff\npublic class CertificateRevocationListBuilder\n{\n    public static CertificateRevocationListBuilder Load(byte[] crl, out BigInteger crlNumber)\n\n+   public static CertificateRevocationListBuilder Load(byte[] crl,\n+                                                       X509Certificate2 issuerCertificate,\n+                                                       out BigInteger crlNumber,\n+                                                       out DateTimeOffset thisUpdate,\n+                                                       out DateTimeOffset nextUpdate,\n+                                                       out DateTimeOffset? nextPublish = default);\n\n    public static CertificateRevocationListBuilder LoadPem(byte[] currentCrl, out BigInteger crlNumber)\n\n+   public static CertificateRevocationListBuilder LoadPem(byte[] currentCrl,\n+                                                          X509Certificate2 issuerCertificate,\n+                                                          out BigInteger crlNumber,\n+                                                          out DateTimeOffset thisUpdate,\n+                                                          out DateTimeOffset nextUpdate,\n+                                                          out DateTimeOffset? nextPublish = default);\n\n\n+  public X509CertificateRevocationList ToX509CertificateRevocationList(X509Certificate2 issuerCertificate,\n+                                                                       BigInteger crlNumber,\n+                                                                       DateTimeOffset nextUpdate,\n+                                                                       HashAlgorithmName hashAlgorithm,\n+                                                                       RSASignaturePadding RSASignaturePadding? rsaSignaturePadding = default,\n+                                                                       DateTimeOffset? thisUpdate = default);\n\n+ public X509CertificateRevocationList ToX509CertificateRevocationList(X500DistinguishedName issuerName,\n+                                                                      X509SignatureGenerator generator,\n+                                                                      BigInteger crlNumber,\n+                                                                      DateTimeOffset nextUpdate, \n+                                                                      HashAlgorithmName hashAlgorithm,\n+                                                                      X509AuthorityKeyIdentifierExtension authorityKeyIdentifier,\n+                                                                      DateTimeOffset? thisUpdate = default);\n}\n```\n\n```diff\n\n+ public static class X509CertificateRevocationListLoader\n+ {\n+     public static X509CertificateRevocationList LoadCertificate(byte[] data);\n+ }\n\n+ public sealed class X509CertificateRevocationList\n+ {\n+     /// <summary>\n+     /// Gets the raw DER-encoded CRL data.\n+     /// </summary>\n+     public byte[] RawData { get; }\n+\n+     /// <summary>\n+     /// Gets the distinguished name of the CRL issuer.\n+     /// </summary>\n+     public X500DistinguishedName IssuerName { get; }\n+\n+     /// <summary>\n+     /// Gets the date when the CRL was issued.\n+     /// </summary>\n+     public DateTime ThisUpdate { get; }\n+\n+     /// <summary>\n+     /// Gets the date when the CRL expires, if present.\n+     /// </summary>\n+     public DateTime NextUpdate { get; }\n+\n+     /// <summary>\n+     /// Gets the date when the next version of the CRL will be issued, if present.\n+     /// </summary>\n+     public DateTime?

sometimes - since last week","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nSince late last week some authentication requests have been failing for some users when logging in with Microsoft using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.MicrosoftAccount`. I'm filing this issue with the limited information I have as it seems urgent - Microsoft SSO seemingly broken - I'll add more information as available. I cannot reproduce the issue myself but for some users it occurs 100% of the time.\n\nWe have this issue across 2 applications/companies, one running `9.0.10` (though, now updated to `9.0.11`) and one `9.0.11`. We also found 2 others complaining about the same issue here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/5651771/why-is-our-coded-microsoft-sso-written-in-net-8-an?source=docs\n\nThey report the same time start. One of them reports that sometimes the `code` field is longer is the failing requests, and is maybe causing the failure. Potentially there has been an Entra change currently being rolled out and the official package can't handle it?\n\nThe suggested workaround appears to be to switch from the official MicrosoftAccount package to the general OIDC package - I'm about to implement this workaround.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64703","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Auth] (AddMicrosoftAccount) handler returning 404 sometimes - since last week\" (#64703)"},{"Id":"3707874357","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-08T20:18:16","Actor":"koshaliev","Number":"64702","RawContent":null,"Title":"[OpenAPI] Trailing slash in servers.url when generating OpenAPI spec","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen generating an OpenAPI document in ASP.NET Core, the servers section ends up with a URL that includes a trailing /. This comes from `GetOpenApiServers` method, which relies on `UriHelper.BuildAbsolute()`. That helper always appends a trailing slash.\n\nAccording to the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification (section 4.8.5.2), the server URLs in the examples is shown without a trailing slash. Because of the current behavior, the generated document doesn’t align with the expected format.\n\nThe issue shows up immediately after adding `AddOpenApi()` with no extra configuration: the generated document contains https://example.com/ instead of https://example.com\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`servers.url` should be generated without a trailing slash, matching the example from the specification.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSteps:\n1.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

It can be set directly or by registering a provider in the Dependency Injection container.\r\n\r\n`TimeProvider` does not truncate to the nearest second, consumers are expected to correctly format the time as needed.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nUnifying the time abstraction across the stack for easier testing.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nComponents that derive from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SecurityStampValidator<TUser>` should remove their `ISystemClock` constructor parameter and call the new base constructor accordingly. Similarly, derived implementations that reference the `Clock` property on these types should reference the new `TimeProvider` property instead. `TimeProvider` is now settable for testing on the options or via DI.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder, ISystemClock clock)\r\n-        : base(options, logger, encoder, clock)\r\n+    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder)\r\n+        : base(options, logger, encoder)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-       var currentUtc = Clock.UtcNow;\r\n+       var currentUtc = TimeProvider.GetUtcNow();\r\n```\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- [`ISystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.isystemclock)\r\n- [`SystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.systemclock)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>.Clock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1.clock)\r\n- [`CookieAuthenticationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationhandler)\r\n- [`FacebookHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.facebook.facebookhandler)\r\n- [`GoogleHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.google.googlehandler)\r\n- [`JwtBearerHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.jwtbearerhandler)\r\n- [`MicrosoftAccountHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.microsoftaccount.microsoftaccounthandler)\r\n- [`NegotiateHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.negotiate.negotiatehandler)\r\n- [`OAuthHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.oauth.oauthhandler-1)\r\n- [`OpenIdConnectHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.openidconnect.openidconnecthandler)\r\n- [`PolicySchemeHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.policyschemehandler)\r\n- [`RemoteAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.remoteauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignInAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signinauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignOutAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signoutauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`TwitterHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.twitter.twitterhandler)\r\n- [`WsFederationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.wsfederation.wsfederationhandler)\r\n- [`SecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.securitystampvalidator-1)\r\n- [`TwoFactorSecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.twofactorsecuritystampvalidator-1)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/505","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider\" (#505)"},{"Id":"1661290568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T20:06:20","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"504","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` no longer use custom converters","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nPrior to .NET 8 Preview 2, `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` type used custom converters to support JSON serialization due to a lack of support for the `IgnoreNullValues` option.

I've been doing this for every version of .NET Core. Today however, after installing the \"**ASP.NET Core 6.0 Runtime (v6.0.3) - Windows Hosting Bundle**\", I tried starting up my web application the way I always do, but started getting a web.config error (IIS Express is unable to read my web.config file). This is my web.config:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n\t<location path=\".\" inheritInChildApplications=\"false\">\r\n\t\t<system.webServer>\r\n\t\t\t<handlers>\r\n\t\t\t\t<add name=\"aspNetCore\" path=\"*\" verb=\"*\" modules=\"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" resourceType=\"Unspecified\" />\r\n\t\t\t</handlers>\r\n\t\t\t<aspNetCore processPath=\"%LAUNCHER_PATH%\" arguments=\"%LAUNCHER_ARGS%\" stdoutLogEnabled=\"false\" hostingModel=\"inprocess\" disableStartUpErrorPage=\"false\">\r\n\t\t\t</aspNetCore>\r\n\t\t</system.webServer>\r\n\t</location>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the screen that I first got:\r\n\r\n![01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20598632/158485269-c88f5b43-3b27-4c2b-9feb-ed11f9aefee2.PNG)\r\n\r\nI noticed after I removed the `<aspNetCore>` section, I got a more detailed error message (Handler \"aspNetCore\" has a bad module \"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" in its module list):\r\n\r\n![02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20598632/158485662-56ed1579-cd98-4884-ab61-ab7bdf1e4a95.PNG)\r\n\r\nSo, it looks like the module \"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" is no longer recognized by IIS Express. To confirm this, I checked IIS Express's **C:\\Program Files\\IIS Express\\AppServer\\applicationhost.config** file. Sure enough, the \"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" section was removed from IIS Express's configuration. Normally, there is a module listed as `<add name=\"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" image=\"%IIS_BIN%\\Asp.Net Core Module\\V2\\aspnetcorev2.dll\" />`:\r\n\r\n![03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20598632/158486327-63cc291d-4d86-46cb-92f4-2375235bad04.PNG)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIIS Express's configuration file located at **C:\\Program Files\\IIS Express\\AppServer\\applicationhost.config** should have a **globalModule** item called \"AspNetCoreModuleV2\", like this:\r\n\r\n`<add name=\"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" image=\"%IIS_BIN%\\Asp.Net Core Module\\V2\\aspnetcorev2.dll\" />`\r\n\r\nAfter the .NET 6.0.3 update, this was removed, breaking IIS Express's support for ASP.NET 6.0.3 applications.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nInstall .NET 6.0.3 and try running a 6.0.3 web application with IIS Express.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.3\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40730","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IIS Express module \"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" is removed after installing the NET Core 6.0 Hosting Bundle, breaking IIS Express's support for 6.0.3\" (#40730)"},{"Id":"1170017148","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T22:28:17","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"40720","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove install-tar & mentions from repo","State":"closed","Body":"Not needed anymore as of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/40669","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/40720","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove install-tar & mentions from repo\" (#40720)"},{"Id":"1170290212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T21:32:53","Actor":"dougbu","Number":"40729","RawContent":null,"Title":"Get richnav.yml building again","State":"open","Body":"- correct build.cmd location\r\n- generally align richnav.yml with ci.yml\r\n  - ignore signing, internal download args, and publish args\r\n\r\nnit: correct name of one build step in ci.yml","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/40729","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Get richnav.yml building again\" (#40729)"},{"Id":"1169949899","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T20:53:17","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"40718","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support OpenAPI summaries and descriptions on minimal endpoints (#40088)","State":"closed","Body":"Forward port of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/commit/bd10e957e9b02b6f7fb626b88db5618120a7ac29 to main.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/40718","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Support OpenAPI summaries and descriptions on minimal endpoints (#40088)\" (#40718)"},{"Id":"1170234256","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T20:44:03","Actor":"avparuch","Number":"40728","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support falling back to ConnectionId when RawConnectionId is 0 in HTTP.sys","State":"open","Body":"Currently, on HTTP.sys, HttpContext.Connection.Id always returns a value of 0 on Windows Server 2019 and below.

It takes place when a project has been configured/initialized with only MVC (`services.AddControllersWithViews()`) and without Razor Pages (invoking `services.AddRazorPages()` causes the exception to be avoided). Merely registering the razor pages service helper is sufficient (i.e. there is no need to actually add any razor pages to the project).\r\n\r\nAs for why this didn't happen in production: the exception only occurs if `mvcBuilder.AddRazorRuntimeCompilation()` was called prior to invoking `UseEndpoints()`, which I had behind an `#if DEBUG` preprocessor switch.\r\n\r\nSo the following should reproduce the exception:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n{\r\n    var mvcBuilder = services.AddControllersWithViews();\r\n    mvcBuilder.AddRazorRuntimeCompilation();\r\n\r\n    // Add other services as needed\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\r\n{\r\n    app.UseStaticFiles();\r\n    app.UseRouting();\r\n    app.UseAuthentication();\r\n    app.UseAuthorization();\r\n\r\n    // Exception here:\r\n    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => {\r\n

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to support using a type that can act like a surrogate for the argument list in a minimal API. The motivation is about refactoring a minimal API that takes a large set of parameters into one that takes a single object with top level properties that represent what were once arguments. This is a common pattern seen with CQRS frameworks where a request object is made to bind all inputs.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.MapGet(\"/products/{id}\", (int id, int pageSize, int page, ILogger<Program> logger, MyDb db) =>\r\n{\r\n    logger.LogInformation(\"Getting products for page {Page}, page);\r\n    \r\n    return db.Products.Skip((page - 1) * pageSize).Take(pageSize);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user wishes to refactor this to:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\napp.MapGet(\"/products/{id}\", ([Parameters]ProductRequest req) =>\r\n{\r\n     req.Logger.LogInformation(\"Getting products for page {Page}, req.Page);\r\n    \r\n     return req.Db.Products.Skip((req.Page - 1) * req.PageSize).Take(req.PageSize);\r\n});\r\n\r\npublic record ProductRequest(int Id, int PageSize, int Page, ILogger<Program> Logger, MyDb Db);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parameter or type needs to be marked explicitly to identify that this is not from the body or elsewhere (query etc). These properties should also support binding attributes:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[Parameters]\r\npublic class ProductRequest\r\n{\r\n  [FromRoute]\r\n  public int Id { get; set; } \r\n\r\n  [FromQuery]\r\n  public int PageSize { get; set; }\r\n\r\n  [FromQuery]\r\n  public int Page { get; set; } \r\n\r\n  [FromServices]\r\n  public ILogger<Program> Logger { get; set; } \r\n\r\n  [FromServices]\r\n  public MyDb Db {get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would only work for top level properties in this object.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n- Do we want to support multiple of these?

The problem is that this method only gets called via `DefaultHttpContextFactory.Initialize(DefaultHttpContext httpContext, IFeatureCollection featureCollection)` and not `DefaultHttpContextFactory.Create(IFeatureCollection featureCollection)`.\r\n\r\nThis means that the first unpooled request over a given Kestrel connection is never marked `_active.` And since `IISHttpContextOfT<TContext>` does not implement `IHostContextContainer<TContext>`, `_active` is never set for requests coming in over IIS.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54385/158269341-a32aed75-e25b-409d-80f6-6dec26f365e8.png)\r\n\r\nThis means those using memory dump analyzers have to go back to looking if `_features` is zeroed out instead of looking at `_active` which was intended to be the easier way to do this but is currently misleading.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`DefaultHttpContext._active` should be set for all ongoing requests served by both IIS and Kestrel if the `DefaultHttpContextFactory` is in use.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nAttach a debugger to an ASP.NET Core app using IIS or Kestrel. Inspect the `HttpContext` of a request which should be a `DefaultHttpCotnext`. With Kestrel, `DefaultHttpContext._active` won't be set for the first request sent over a connection (or any other unpooled request). With IIS, `DefaultHttpContext._active` is never set.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n7.0.100-preview.3.22163.1\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40705","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"DefaultHttpContextFactory.Create(IFeatureCollection) does not set DefaultHttpContext._active\" (#40705)"},{"Id":"1168962075","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T22:07:12","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"40704","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make IResults types public","State":"open","Body":"Fix #40656","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/40704","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Make IResults types public\" (#40704)"},{"Id":"1168957843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T22:02:11","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"40703","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix WindowsHostingBundle","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\narm64 installers change broke the windows hosting bundle since now it builds x64/x86/arm64 when the idea is there's a single hosting bundle (x86) that contains all the payloads\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track the work to fix the hosting bundle \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nHosting bundle can install\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40703","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fix WindowsHostingBundle\" (#40703)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change.

Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license.

The options `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` no longer exist, and some additional options now exist.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously to use the MessagePack hub protocol in the browser you needed to include 3 script references\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/msgpack5/msgpack5.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr-protocol-msgpack.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition the `msgpack5` package was downloaded to your `node_modules` so you could use it in your app if you wanted.\r\n\r\n`MessagePackOptions` had `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` properties, but doesn't anymore.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nTo use the MessagePack hub protocol in the browser you now only need 2 script references\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr-protocol-msgpack.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you will have the `@msgpack/msgpack` package downloaded to your `node_modules` if you want to use the directly in your app.\r\n\r\n`MessagePackOptions` has new properties and removed the `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` properties.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nReduced asset size, reduced complexity to consume the package, and more customizability.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you were previously using `msgpack5` in your app, you will need to add a direct reference to the library in your package.json.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nRemoved `MessagePackOptions.disableTimestampEncoding`\r\nRemoved `MessagePackOptions.forceFloat64`\r\n\r\n### Discussion issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30471\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/454","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Changed MessagePack library in @microsoft/signalr-protocol-msgpack javascript library\" (#454)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1501256562895036419","CreatedAt":"2022-03-08T18:00:31+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Community Standup - Native client apps with Blazor Hybrid https://t.co/f5vHcTQhd2","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":18,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1496168009215344643","CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T17:00:25+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Community Standup - 20 Years of https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8🎂 https://t.co/XXTMIc5Dy9","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":8,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1496167407744086018","CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T16:58:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

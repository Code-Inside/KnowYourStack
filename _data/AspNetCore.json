The templates shouldn't promote bad practice and poor accessibility. Fixing a few issues would improve the overall optics of Blazor for people onboarding, especially if they're coming from other frameworks that are detail oriented in terms of HTML/CSS/A11y. \r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\n1. Markup, CSS issues:\r\n\r\nThe `!important` keyword in CSS is a code smell. In this case, the template has used the Bootstrap utility `px-4` class​ to set the padding in the [markup](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/2335aa56f519790c4b4b53b955b26f29f7030d36/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/BlazorWeb-CSharp/BlazorWeb-CSharp/Components/Layout/MainLayout.razor#L14). In the CSS,  the class is overridden using a new selector and [padding value](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/2335aa56f519790c4b4b53b955b26f29f7030d36/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/BlazorWeb-CSharp/BlazorWeb-CSharp/Components/Layout/MainLayout.razor.css#L74-L77). This causes confusion when customizing the template. \r\n\r\nThis is just one simple example, but overall it is a lot of CSS and Bootstrap fighting each other. My recommendation would be to go all in on Boostrap, or remove it completely. I've been working on an example that leans into Boostrap and eliminates redundant CSS like the example above. As much as I personally would like to see Boostrap sunset, it is still one of the easiest ways to onboard new devs. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the topbar, sidebar and main page are oddly constructed in markup. I feel like this might be related to the Boostrap and CSS duality.\r\n\r\n2. A11y:\r\n\r\nThere is at least one priority item, like turning off a11y features directly through CSS, [this focus effect](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/2335aa56f519790c4b4b53b955b26f29f7030d36/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/BlazorWeb-CSharp/BlazorWeb-CSharp/wwwroot/app.css#L25C1-L28C1). `*:focus` is [one of the most common a11y criticisms](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/#:%7E:text=Using%20the%20CSS%20rule%20%3Afocus,with%20the%20link%20or%20control.). We should look at color contrast as well, since this is another high priority and easily remedied. \r\n\r\nThere's also an _interesting and creative_ 💖 use of a checkbox  to control the responsive menu. I feel that this was implemented to help with static rendering, so the [nav could be hidden and shown on mobile without interactivity](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/2335aa56f519790c4b4b53b955b26f29f7030d36/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/BlazorWeb-CSharp/BlazorWeb-CSharp/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor#L7) (C#/JS), however the a11y aspect of it is questionable. In the short term, this item should have aria-controls​ attributes added to it. In the long term, something needs to address the missing[ `aria-expanded`​ attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-expanded) (likely requires interactivity to toggle).\r\n\r\nDo a full review of the HTML semantics to see if the page is constructed properly. Semantic HTML structure plays a critical role in a11y. The usage of `main` and `article` in the template could possibly be an issue.  \r\n\r\nThere is an issue with the `nav ul` where it does not use [semantically correct, or structurally correct HTML](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/2335aa56f519790c4b4b53b955b26f29f7030d36/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/BlazorWeb-CSharp/BlazorWeb-CSharp/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor#L10C7-L30). The correct usage should be `ul > li`, not `ul > div`.\r\n\r\n3. Modernization (both web standards and Blazor features)\r\n\r\nOnce the aforementioned items are cleaned up, it should be easier to add some modern features like CSS variables that will enable basic customizations that are accessible to Junior level HTML/CSS devs. \r\n\r\nHaving some examples of the SectionOutlet​ might be nice to see in the sample content, but the state of the current markup makes this difficult to add.\r\n\r\n## In scope\r\n\r\n- [ ] Choose to lean into Bootstrap and remove CSS code that overlaps or fights with Bootstrap classes.\r\n- [ ] Restructure the markup so the header (topbar), sidebar, and main content have a simpler logical structure. Lean into Bootstrap, and remove custom layout CSS code.\r\n- [ ] Review and fix basic HTML/CSS accessibility issues.\r\n- [ ] Review HTML semantics and update if needed.\r\n- [ ] Add CSS variables for customization of theme color and utilize Bootstrap 5 CSS variables where appropriate. \r\n- [ ] Add `SectionOutlet` sample where appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Risks / unknowns\r\n\r\nUnsure if there is an accessible alternative to the navbar show/hide feature using a checkbox. Is it an accessibility issue? If so, can it be fixed without introducing JavaScript or C#?\r\n\r\nAre there any dependencies outside of Blazor in ASP.NET that will be impacting by the changes? Ex: Identity templates. \r\n\r\n## Sample repo\r\n\r\nThe following repo contains a refactored version of the static rendered project template.

I've manually tested a representative selection of project combinations, but there are a huge number of possible combinations altogether so naturally I haven't manually checked them all.\r\n\r\nAs discussed with the team earlier, I've added `<RedirectToLogin>`, but have not changed the `\"/Account\"` path matching as that is something we can make more of a decision about later when @halter73 completes his follow-ups and possibly has additional options (e.g., maybe a base class, or some other mechanism).\r\n\r\nNote that I have also moved as much of the identity stuff as I could under a single `Components/Account` subdir so it's easier for people to focus on their own code at the start of their new project.

\"CallbackUrl\"","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nI'd like an optional `string? CallbackUrl` since I'll likely have **multiple** frontends on different (sub)domains, consuming the same Auth API.\r\nPassing that (sub)domain URL all the way through, would enable that.\r\n\r\nFor example, https://www.leashr.com & https://www.belgiandoggos.be use the same API for authentication & authorization.\r\nSetting either one in my `appSettings.json` won't cut it.\r\n\r\nSo, I prefer you just make the parameters available so we can form our own URLs and decide whether it goes to a frontend or backend. Then, I can also choose to use route parameters rather than query string parameters on my Blazor frontends.\r\n\r\nFeel free to watch my implementation of RC1: https://youtu.be/yGYpN1hFPAg?si=zlLykBIas_WBjXWN\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\n    Task SendConfirmationEmailAsync<TUser>(TUser user, string email, string code, string confirmationLink, string? callbackUrl) where TUser : class\r\n    {\r\n        return SendEmailAsync(email, code, confirmationLink, callbackUrl);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Merged ResetCode & ResetLink into one.\r\n    Task SendPasswordResetEmailAsync<TUser>(TUser user, string email, string resetCode, string resetLink, string? callbackUrl) where TUser : class\r\n    {\r\n        return SendEmailAsync(email, resetCode, resetLink, callbackUrl);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\n    public sealed class NoOpEmailSender : IEmailSender\r\n    {\r\n        public Task SendEmailAsync(string email, string code, string link, string? callbackUrl) => Task.CompletedTask;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### DTO\r\n\r\nYou'll need to add the `string? CallbackUrl` property to your request & response DTO's as well to pass the value all the way down and back to the consumer.\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\n    public async Task SendConfirmationEmailAsync<TUser>(TUser user, string email, string code, string confirmationLink, string? callbackUrl) where TUser : class\r\n    {\r\n        var frontendConfirmationLink = $\"<a href='{callbackUrl}/{user.UserId}/{code}'>clicking here</a>\";\r\n        \r\n        await SendEmailAsync(email, $\"{user.Name}, confirm your email\", $\"Please confirm message (in my native language) {frontendConfirmationLink}.\");\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Merged ResetCode & ResetLink into one.\r\n    public async Task SendPasswordResetEmailAsync<TUser>(TUser user, string email, string resetCode, string resetLink, string? callbackUrl) where TUser : class\r\n    {\r\n        var frontendResetLink = $\"<a href='{callbackUrl}/{email}/{resetCode}'>clicking here</a>\";\r\n    \r\n        await SendEmailAsync(email, $\"{user.Name}, reset your password\", $\"Reset password message (in my native language): {frontendResetLink}\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nThe formed links are fine as an example but a pain to extract from & reformat.\r\nThe subject & message are likely to be translated or changed, so mainly serve as an example as well.\r\nI don't think you need either of the above but feel free to leave those in.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nWill need good documentation to prevent confusion about being able to use the provided link but also to use the parameters to form your own link.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50904","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Identity Endpoints API - Optional

`AntiforgeryStateProvider` class added #49108, it always returns null from `GetAntiforgeryToken()` on the Blazor Wasm side, after pre-rendering. I'm trying to use the token returned from this class to call an API controller that is annotated with `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`GetAntiforgeryToken()` should return a non null token.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn your Blazor page, `Test.razor`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@inject AntiforgeryStateProvider Antiforgery\r\n\r\n<button @onclick=\"GetAntiforgery\">Get Antiforgery</button>\r\n<pre>\r\n    @mDebug\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    private string? mDebug;\r\n\r\n    private void GetAntiforgery()\r\n    {\r\n        mDebug = \"Token: \" + Antiforgery.GetAntiforgeryToken()?.Value;        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your `.cshtml` file that displays the pre-rendered component:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<component type=\"typeof(Test)\" render-mode=\"WebAssemblyPrerendered\" />\r\n\r\n@section Scripts {\r\n    <script src=\"_framework/blazor.webassembly.js\"></script>\r\n}\r\n\r\n<persist-component-state />\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you click the \"Get Antiforgery\" button, I would expect to see \"Token: \" followed by random digits. But was I actually see is just \"Token: \".\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nThe two relevant classes are:\r\n\r\n- [`DefaultAntiforgeryStateProvider`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v8.0.0-rc.1.23421.29/src/Components/Shared/src/DefaultAntiforgeryStateProvider.cs) - the implementation of the `AntiforgeryStateProvider` on the client side.\r\n- [`EndpointAntiforgeryStateProvider`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v8.0.0-rc.1.23421.29/src/Components/Endpoints/src/Forms/EndpointAntiforgeryStateProvider.cs) - a subclass `DefaultAntiforgeryStateProvider` that is used on the server side during pre-rendering.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the problem is `DefaultAntiforgeryStateProvider` only reads a value from `PersistentComponentState` in the constructor. `_currentToken` is readonly, so it is not possible for it get set in another way. `EndpointAntiforgeryStateProvider` is the only subclass of `DefaultAntiforgeryStateProvider`, but it has no way to communicate its token to its base class to be persisted.\r\n\r\nWhen I change `DefaultAntiforgeryStateProvider` to call the virtual `GetAntiforgeryToken()` method to get the token to persist, the problem goes away, i.e. `GetAntiforgeryToken()` starts returning a non null token on the WebAssembly side:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AustinWise/aspnetcore/commit/63e9553beaeb7307f4f6e8f6dbaa34f9492a432f\r\n\r\nNote that this only fixes components in `render-mode=\"WebAssemblyPrerendered\"`. I'm not sure how `DefaultAntiforgeryStateProvider` is supposed to work in  `render-mode=\"WebAssembly\"`, as I don't think `PersistentComponentState` works in there.\r\n\r\nIn case it's helpful, here is the commit from my application where I use antiforgery: https://github.com/AustinWise/DinnerKillPoints/commit/b8e4effddf0045d066902278ecfdee3f869085a1","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50900","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AntiforgeryStateProvider always returns a null token in WebAssemblyPrerendered mode\" (#50900)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT. These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

The trouble comes when I add the recursive model in a collection in another model:\n\n```csharp\nrecord Trees\n{\n    public required List<Tree> List { get; init; }\n}\n\napp.MapGet(\"/trees\",\n    () => new Trees { List = [] });\n```\n\nTwo problems occur here. First of all, the `Tree` model inside `Tree.List` gets its own schema (called `Tree2` in my case). The other problem is, the new `components.schemas.Tree2.properties.children.items.\"$ref\"` looks to refer back to the list of the enclosing `Trees` model:\n\n```json5\n  \"components\": {\n    \"schemas\": {\n      \"Tree\": {\n        // ...\n      },\n      \"Tree2\": {    // <--- This shouldn't exist, could just re-use Tree\n        \"required\": [\n          \"value\",\n          \"children\"\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"value\": {\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\n            \"format\": \"int32\"\n          },\n          \"children\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/#/properties/list/items\"    // <--- This schema reference is incorrect\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"Trees\": {\n        \"required\": [\n          \"list\"\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"list\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/Tree2\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nIf I only had the `/trees/` endpoint, the `Tree` schema would be necessary to generate of course. However, here it already exists. The schema reference is incorrect and should just point to `Tree2` or ideally `Tree`. I am not well-versed in the OpenAPI specification, so I determine it's \"incorrect\" because the Spectral Linter calls it out and Kiota is unable to parse this schema reference.\n\nThe same thing happens if I put `Tree` inside a Dictionary. It generates this type of schema reference:\n\n```json5\n\"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/#/properties/lookup/additionalProperties/items\"\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nGenerate the schema without duplicate `Tree` definitions and with correct schema references:\n\n```json5\n  \"components\": {\n    \"schemas\": {\n      \"Tree\": { \n        \"required\": [\n          \"value\",\n          \"children\"\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"value\": {\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\n            \"format\": \"int32\"\n          },\n          \"children\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/Tree\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"Trees\": {\n        \"required\": [\n          \"list\"\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"list\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/Tree\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI have created a minimal API showing the behavior:\nhttps://gist.github.com/thorhj/933f07533ff1c8206ed7ebefd4d91c6a\n\nIn it I have included an endpoint returning just the recursive model `Tree` (valid), the recursive model inside a `List<Tree>` property (invalid) and the recursive data model inside a `Dictionary<int, Tree>` (invalid).\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.101\n\n### Anything else?\n\n```pwsh\n> dotnet --info\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.101\n Commit:            eedb237549\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.12+1cce77968\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.22631\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.101\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.206 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  8.0.404 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  None\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59879","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Recursive data models inside collections yield invalid schema references\" (#59879)"},{"Id":"2788195216","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-14T20:12:47","Actor":"ReinoutWW","Number":"59875","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a built-in detection or safeguard for infinite or excessive render loops in Blazor (particularly for Blazor Server).","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nWe're running into some challenges with rerendering loops. We have a rather complex use-case that we're building in Blazor SSR. Because the complexity, we've seen that some code paths could lead to infinite render loops because a StateHasChanged triggers itself via various ways (could be via other components)\n\nWe'd like a built-in detection or safeguard for infinite or excessive render loops in Blazor (particularly for Blazor Server)\n\nIn Blazor Server all connected clients can be affected by a single resource-usage spike on the server. Catching these problematic patterns early can save significant time in debugging and costly crashes in production environments. We've seen this happen multiple times over the months\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nProposal:\n\n- Introduce a fail-safe feature or diagnostic mode to detect repeated or continuous re-renders within a short time frame (similar to the infinite loop detection in frameworks like React).\n- Provide diagnostic logs or error messages indicating which component(s) triggered repeated renders.\n- Optionally, throttle or halt rendering until the problematic code path is resolved, to prevent server crash.\n\n### Additional context\n\nOnce we are running into a scenario where all server resources are being depleted by a render loop, we usually take a memory dump. Upon inspecting the memory dump we see objects like `RenderTreeDiff` and `RenderTreeFrame`. These lists can build up to multiple gigabytes memory\n\nExample:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f743523-109f-4187-b86b-ecd27ff540f8)\n\n\nProblem Context:\n\n- In larger Blazor Server projects, it's relatively 'easy' for components to trigger each other's StateHasChanged(), causing repeated re-renders.\n- In certain cases, this can escalate into a render loop with no end. (Even when a Blazor circuit is closed)\n- The result is a spike in server resource usage—especially memory—that can consume all available resources and lead to an application crash or forced restart. This will also cause a spike in CPU usage as the garbage collector will have to work harder to clean up all created objects.\n- Currently, Blazor does not provide a straightforward way to detect or mitigate such loops.\n- A built-in detection mechanism or diagnostic warning could help developers quickly identify or prevent these scenarios, reducing downtime and production incidents.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59875","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add a built-in detection or safeguard for infinite or excessive render loops in Blazor (particularly for Blazor Server).\" (#59875)"},{"Id":"2788135618","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-14T19:36:16","Actor":"fdonnet","Number":"59874","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor: (automode) - generate \"reverse proxy layer\" (Idea)","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

When a request is made Blazor server willl call hybrid cache to get the corresponding \"access and refresh token\".\n\nWhen you are in auto-mode, when your compos are wasm, you simply use a CookieHandler and all the stuff is forwarded and it's great.\n\nBut to be able to call your external api, you need to put some sort of \"reverse proxy\" in place (create \"reverse\" enpoints server side that will call your real HttpClient (forward the request and forward the response back to wasm).\n\nOn wasm your httpclient (same interface as server side) will call these \"blazor reverse

working after upgrade to .NET 9","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nLast week, I upgraded my Blazor Wasm PWA from .NET 7 to .NET 9. I tested everything, created a publish build and published it. It works without any problems.\nSo, I continued the work on the app and wanted to test something today. To do so, I created a publish build with `<RunAOTCompilation>false</RunAOTCompilation>`, simply because compilation is faster without AOT. The build was successful but the app cannot be loaded in the browser. One error message says, that Blazored.LocalStorage throws a Not Implemented Yet exception:\n\n> MONO interpreter: NIY encountered in method Blazored.LocalStorage.ServiceCollectionExtensions:AddBlazoredLocalStorage (Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection)\n\nSo, I already started a bug report at the Blazored.LocalStorage github repo, but then found out that this package cannot be the (only) reason for the error. Let me explain:\nIn this case, 3 things can make the app crash:\n\n- I modified the code,\n- Blazored.LocalStorage is not ready for .NET 9 and\n- I changed with/without AOT\n\nI tested all 8 combinations (with/without code changes, with/without Blazored.LocalStorage, with/without AOT). The only 2 cases, I can make the app run, are\n\n- without changes, without AOT, without Blazored.LocalStorage\n- with changes, without AOT, without Blazored.LocalStorage\n\nOkay, it only works without Blazored.LocalStorage. That's why I first thought, this package causes the error. But it also does not work\n\n- without changes, with AOT, without Blazored.LocalStorage\n\nSo, I tried to go back to .NET 7, but without success. I cannot make the app run. That's a severe problem, because I cannot publish updates currently.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Here are some error messages</summary>\n  <p>MONO interpreter: NIY encountered in method Blazored.LocalStorage.ServiceCollectionExtensions:AddBlazoredLocalStorage (Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection)\ndotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3  [MONO] * Assertion: should not be reached at /__w/1/s/src/mono/mono/mini/interp/interp.c:3965\n\nError\n    at Fc (https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3:168644)\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[8300]:0x1faf36\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[792]:0x3e9ad\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[713]:0x3ca50\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[717]:0x3cb71\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[720]:0x3cbda\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[93]:0x7e8d\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[130]:0x16b93\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[2902]:0xcfdb8\n    at https://[...].netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.8uqnh0fgel.wasm:wasm-function[2266]:0xa6af7\nFc @ dotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3\nblazor.webassembly.js:1  \nExitStatusmessage: \"Program terminated with exit(1)\"name: \"ExitStatus\"status: 1[[Prototype]]: Object</p>\n\n\n<p>dotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3 \n [MONO] /__w/1/s/src/mono/mono/mini/aot-runtime.c:2139 <disabled>\nError\n    at Fc (https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3:168644)\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[77113]:0x1589a96\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[69624]:0x13be1ea\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[69547]:0x13bc122\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[69549]:0x13bc1ef\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[69550]:0x13bc225\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[71818]:0x145b471\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[70066]:0x13dcfd0\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[70071]:0x13dd9cc\n    at https://neon-rabanadas-970146.netlify.app/_framework/dotnet.native.xw1lrtwtqd.wasm:wasm-function[70063]:0x13dccbb\nFc\t@\tdotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3\ndotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3 \n MONO_WASM: mono_wasm_load_runtime () failed [object Object]\nPe\t@\tdotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3\ndotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3 \n Uncaught (in promise) \nExitStatus\ndotnet.runtime.o8gq1i8bk6.js:3 \n Uncaught (in promise) \nExitStatus\nblazor.webassembly.js:1 \n Uncaught (in promise) Error: Failed to start platform.

a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app","State":"open","Body":"Some time ago, Bossman Dan Roth [reported here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18612), that the URL (e.g. `localhost:xxxxx`) of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app \"should be generated randomly by Visual Studio\". That issue has been resolved and that's certainly what's happening on my machine. Perfect.\n\nMy question is, how can I determine what URL will be (or has been) assigned by Visual Studio, please?\n\nI either need to control the URL (set it myself in launchSettings or my Aspire AppHost) or I need to read it (from either the Blazor server project or my Aspire AppHost) once it has been assigned by Visual Studio. I don't mind which.\n\n**The use case**\nMy hosted Blazor WebAssembly app is a client of a Web API. The client's URL should get listed in the Web API's CORS configuration. For example (in the web API)\n\n```\n// Get a list of clients allowed to access the Web API.\nvar clients = builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"Clients\").Get<string[]>() ?? [];\n// Getting the URL of the Blazor server app was easy using existing Aspire features. Hopefully I can figure out how to get the Blazor WebAssembly app onto this list too.\n\nbuilder.Services.AddCors(options =>\n{\n    options.AddDefaultPolicy(policy =>\n    {\n        policy.WithOrigins(clients); // Allow the list of clients to access the Web API\n        policy.AllowAnyMethod();\n        policy.WithHeaders(\"X-Requested-With\");\n        policy.AllowCredentials();\n    });\n});\n```\nI thought perhaps it could be set in the launchSettings.json file of the client app, like this:\n```\n{\n  \"profiles\": {\n    \"Blazor.Client\": {\n      \"commandName\": \"Project\",\n      \"launchBrowser\": true,\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:7279;http://localhost:5279\",\n      \"launchUrl\": \"https://localhost:7279/Counter\",\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nBut the content of that file seems to be ignored by Visual Studio when launching a Blazor WebAssembly app. Can anybody point me in the correct direction please? How do I know the URL at which my Blazor WASM app is going to run early enough in the app lifecycle that I can add it as a client of the web API?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59860","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Question - how to know the URL assigned to a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app\"

optional parameter 'forceReload'","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHey!\n\nI wanted to use `NavigationManager.Refresh(forceReload: false)` on our .NET8 Blazor Server app and noticed that `forceReload` is not being passed through to `NavigateTo`, instead the `forceReload` of `NavigateTo` defaults to `true`. You can easily see what I mean in this file in line 178:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8d6d208542cbfa4553ae59436cc90d84aac08c6a/src/Components/Components/src/NavigationManager.cs#L178\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI assume this is not intentional as I cannot come up with a reason why it would be. If the parameter exists one would expect it to be used, right?\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nThe code is obvious, but `NavigationManager.Refresh(forceReload: false)` reproduces the issue.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nNone\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.x\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI think the issue speaks for itsself.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59854","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NavigationManager.Refresh does not make use of optional parameter 'forceReload'\" (#59854)"},{"Id":"2783794093","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T12:12:58","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"59853","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update .NET SDK to 10.0.100-alpha.1.25063.8","State":"open","Body":"Updates the .NET SDK to version `10.0.100-alpha.1.25063.8`, which also updates the .NET runtime from version [``10.0.0-alpha.1.25052.4``](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/commits/a93a592ce99414d94dafbd0ef0a6f51b6fbcdaf4) to version [``10.0.0-alpha.1.25062.3``](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/commits/08924bc0d787ff909914bf0fb3442a8627b8edfd).\n\nThis pull request was auto-generated by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/actions/runs/12746939448).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59853","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update .NET SDK to 10.0.100-alpha.1.25063.8\" (#59853)"},{"Id":"2783025959","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T07:00:56","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"59849","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:32db3699-5666-45da-a1b7-08d8b804cd75)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\n- **Subscription**: 32db3699-5666-45da-a1b7-08d8b804cd75\n- **Build**: 20250112.3\n- **Date Produced**: January 13, 2025 12:52:23 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: 010e61a4f46d6d9b544cde169dc034417de7223a\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  -

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

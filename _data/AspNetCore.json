The issue is caused by the use of unbounded `ReplaySubject.create()` in two places:\n\n1. `InvocationRequest.java:14` - `private final Subject<Object> pendingCall = ReplaySubject.create();`\n2. `HubConnection.java:796` - `ReplaySubject<T> subject = ReplaySubject.create();` (in the `stream()` method)\n\nThese unbounded replay subjects cache ALL emitted items indefinitely, causing memory to grow without bounds during long-running WebSocket connections with continuous data streams.\n\n### To Reproduce\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Create a SignalR Java client connection\n2. Use the `stream()` method to subscribe to a high-frequency data stream (e.g., real-time trading data)\n3. Keep the connection running for extended periods (>1 hour)\n4. Monitor memory usage - it will continuously grow until OutOfMemoryError occurs\n\nExample code:\n```java\nHubConnection hubConnection = HubConnectionBuilder.create(\"wss://example.com/hub\")\n    .withAccessTokenProvider(Single.just(accessToken))\n    .build();\n\nhubConnection.start().blockingAwait();\n\n// This will cause memory leak over time\nObservable<MarketData> stream = hubConnection.stream(MarketData.class, \"StreamMarketData\", \"symbol\");\nstream.subscribe(data -> {\n    // Process real-time data\n});\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\nThe streaming connection should maintain stable memory usage over time, not accumulating all historical data in memory.\n\n### Actual behavior\nMemory usage grows continuously as `ReplaySubject` caches all emitted items. This leads to OutOfMemoryError after extended periods of streaming.\n\n### Workaround\nCurrently, we're forced to periodically disconnect and reconnect the SignalR connection every 5-15 minutes to clear the internal buffers and prevent OOM errors.\n\n### Suggested Fix\nReplace unbounded `ReplaySubject.create()` with either:\n1. Bounded replay: `ReplaySubject.createWithSize(bufferSize)` \n2. PublishSubject for no caching: `PublishSubject.create()`\n3. Make buffer size configurable\n\n### Environment\n- SignalR Java Client version: 9.0.4\n- Java version: 11/17\n- Platform: Android\n- RxJava version: 3.x\n\n### Stack trace\n```\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Failed to allocate a 24 byte allocation with 1349584 free bytes and 1317KB until OOM\n    at com.android.org.conscrypt.ConscryptEngine.newResult(ConscryptEngine.java:1363)\n    at com.android.org.conscrypt.ConscryptEngine.unwrap(ConscryptEngine.java:933)\n    ...\n    at okhttp3.internal.ws.WebSocketReader.processNextFrame(WebSocketReader.kt:0)\n    at okhttp3.internal.ws.RealWebSocket.loopReader(RealWebSocket.kt:293)\n```\n\n### Additional context\nThis issue affects production applications using SignalR for real-time data streaming, particularly in financial trading applications where data streams are continuous and high-frequency.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63134","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SignalR Java Client 9.0.4: Memory leak in stream() method due to unbounded ReplaySubject\" (#63134)"},{"Id":"3290420680","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-05T15:28:46","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"63110","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add analyzer to warn when SupplyParameterFromForm properties have non-default initializers","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds a new Roslyn analyzer (BL0008) that detects when properties decorated with `[SupplyParameterFromForm]` have non-default initializers, which can lead to unexpected null values during form posts.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen using `[SupplyParameterFromForm]` with non-default property initializers like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\n{\n    [SupplyParameterFromForm] public InputModel Input { get; set; } = new InputModel();\n}\n```\n\nThe initializer can be overwritten with `null` during form submission, causing `EditForm` to fail with:\n\n> InvalidOperationException: EditForm requires either a Model parameter, or an EditContext parameter, please provide one of these.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe analyzer warns developers when this pattern is detected, while safely ignoring default value initializers (`= null`, `= null!`, `= default`, `= default!`) that don't cause the same issue.\n\n**Warning Message:**\n> Property 'MyComponent.Input' has [SupplyParameterFromForm] and a property initializer.

This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\nFirst, please describe the purpose and value of the new API here.\n-->\nIn our blazor server application we catch global errors in our system and report back, so our team knows when a user has encountered an unintended error. However, circuit exceptions are ones we are unable to monitor. So when a user gets a circuit exception we have trouble tracing back the original problem. I would like it if the UnhandledExcpetion in the CurcuitHost or Renderer was a publicly available event, or triggered a publicly available event somewhere else, so our app could intercept the exception and log it as desired.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n<!--\nPlease provide the specific public API signature diff that you are proposing.

The event could also be exposed via a public interface, I'm just not sure where that would best be housed.

The error didn't provide any guidance on how to fix the issue.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `PropertyGetterFactory` method in `PersistentValueProviderComponentSubscription.cs` used `type.GetProperty(propertyName)` which by default only searches for public properties. When a private property was found during component scanning but couldn't be accessed during runtime, it appeared as \"not found.\"\n\n## Solution\n\nEnhanced the property lookup and validation logic to provide a clear, unified error message for all cases where a public property with a public getter cannot be found.\n\n## Before/After\n\n**Before:**\n```\nProperty currentCount not found on type BlazorApp.Net10.Components.Pages.Counter\n```\n\n**After:**\n```\nA public property 'currentCount' on component type 'BlazorApp.Net10.Components.Pages.Counter' with a public getter wasn't found.\n```\n\nThe new error message clearly explains what's expected and covers all failure scenarios:\n- Property doesn't exist at all\n- Property exists but isn't public\n- Property is public but getter isn't public\n\n## Testing\n\n- Added comprehensive tests covering private properties, private getters, and public properties\n- Verified all existing tests continue to pass\n- Ensured the fix follows clean error handling patterns\n\nFixes #62859.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

BearerTokenHandler from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication","State":"open","Body":"<!--\nThis template is useful to build consensus about whether work should be done, and if so, the high-level shape of how it should be approached. Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\n-->\n\n## Summary\n\nMake [BearerTokenHandler](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/fab448a153e8e2683a652f1fd1e8ef7d917c3110/src/Security/Authentication/BearerToken/src/BearerTokenHandler.cs) public (instead of internal sealed) to allow customization by overriding its behavior, particularly HandleSignInAsync.\n\nThe alternative is creating my own handler which inherits from [SignInAuthenticationHandler](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/fab448a153e8e2683a652f1fd1e8ef7d917c3110/src/Security/Authentication/Core/src/SignInAuthenticationHandler.cs#L14) and implement token authorization myself. This has the possible benefit of allowing custom BearerTokenOptions but is otherwise mostly identical to the existing BearerTokenHandler.\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nI am trying to use AspNetCore.Authentication in combination with ASP.NET Core Identity taking advantage of user and role management. However, in order to comply with company wide API specifications I want to customize the sign in token response.\n\nMy goal is to use given access and refresh tokens with all the claims that Asp automatically includes but customize the response body of my sign in endpoint. In other word serving the pregenerated tokens in a different package.\n\n## In scope\n\n- Add custom fields to response body on HandleSignInAsync\n- Services.AddBearerToken() using custom Handler\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Custom BearerTokenOptions\n- Updating AspNetCore.Idenity.AddIdentityApiEndpoints\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n\n- Other devs might overcomplicate things by overriting the BearerTokenHandler instead of using existing configuration capabilities\n- Overwriting a crucial security class might encompass security risks by introduced by the developer. However, the other classes in Authentication are public as well.\n- Other authentication handlers in ASP.NET Core (like JwtBearerHandler, CookieAuthenticationHandler, etc.) are public and overridable. This consistency would support advanced customization scenarios while maintaining the intended structure of the authentication system.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n// ApplicationBearerTokenHandler.cs\npublic class ApplicationBearerTokenHandler(\n    IOptionsMonitor<BearerTokenOptions> optionsMonitor,\n    ILoggerFactory loggerFactory, UrlEncoder urlEncoder\n    ) : BearerTokenHandler (optionsMonitor, loggerFactory, urlEncoder)\n{\n...\n}\n\n// Program.cs\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication(IdentityConstants.BearerScheme)\n    .AddBearerToken<ApplicationBearerTokenHandler>(IdentityConstants.BearerScheme);\n\n```\n\n<!--\n# Detailed design\n\nIt's often best not to fill this out until you get basic consensus about the above. When you do, consider adding an implementation proposal with the following headings:\n\nDetailed design\nDrawbacks\nConsidered alternatives\nOpen questions\nReferences\n\nIf there's one clear design you have consensus on, you could do that directly in a PR.\n-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63127","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose BearerTokenHandler from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication\" (#63127)"},{"Id":"3290820445","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-05T07:48:45","Actor":"ssougnez","Number":"63112","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to run my project with Visual Studio 17.14.11","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI've just upgraded to the version 17.14.11 of Visual Studio and since then, I can't run my project anymore because of \"Unable to find package Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Runtime.win-x64 with version (= 9.0.8)\".\n\nWhen I check on NuGet, I don't see the 9.0.8 version.\n\nIs it because Visual Studio is released before the NuGet?

Add a new web api project (minimal api template is fine).  Add a reference to the .client project in the web api project.  Set the solution to start up the blazor host and the web api project.  Make a change to the weather forecast api endpoint and observe that it hot reloads.  Move the WeatherForecast record into the .client project.  Run the solution again, make the change to the web api and hot reload will break because it classifies the web api project as a Web Assembly project.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n.net core 9\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hot Reload breaks when a web api project references and uses a class from a blazor.client project\" (#63119)"},{"Id":"3290893181","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-04T21:55:42","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"63118","RawContent":null,"Title":"[dnceng-bot] Branch `aspnetcore/release/9.0` can't be merged to Azdo internal branch","State":"open","Body":"Branch [release/9.0](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/commits/release/9.0/) in `dotnet/aspnetcore` repo can't be mirrored from GitHub to Azure [internal/release/9.0](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-aspnetcore?version=GBinternal%2Frelease%2F9.0&_a=history) via internal merge. \n\nThere are conflicting commits in the target branch.\nThe branch is configured to be mirrored via automated merge. \nThe situation is rare but normal.

For example:\n\n```csharp\npublic class CustomFromKeyedServicesAttribute : FromKeyedServicesAttribute\n{\n    public CustomFromKeyedServicesAttribute(object key) : base(key) { }\n}\n\n// This would not be detected by the framework\npublic void MyAction([CustomFromKeyedServices(\"myKey\")] IMyService service) { }\n```\n\n## Solution\n\nEnhanced inheritance checking across all code generation components:\n\n- **MVC Model Binding** (`BindingInfo.cs`) - Ensures derived attributes work in MVC controller actions\n- **HTTP Extensions** (`RequestDelegateFactory.cs`) - Enables derived attributes in minimal API endpoints  \n- **SignalR Core** (`HubMethodDescriptor.cs`) - Supports derived attributes in SignalR hub methods\n- **Request Delegate Generator** (`EndpointParameter.cs`) - Handles derived attributes in source generators\n- **Validation Generator** (`ITypeSymbolExtensions.cs`) - Detects derived attributes during compilation\n\n## Infrastructure Changes\n\nAdded robust inheritance checking methods to `SymbolExtensions.cs`:\n- `InheritsFrom()` - Checks if a type inherits from a base class\n- `TryGetAttributeInheritingFrom()` - Finds attributes that derive from a base type\n\n## Changes Made\n\n1. **BindingInfo.cs**: Updated attribute detection to use `typeof(FromKeyedServicesAttribute).IsAssignableFrom(a.GetType())`\n2. **RequestDelegateFactory.cs**: Fixed two locations using similar inheritance-aware checks  \n3. **HubMethodDescriptor.cs**: Enhanced pattern matching to handle derived types\n4. **EndpointParameter.cs**: Replaced `TryGetAttribute` with `TryGetAttributeInheritingFrom` for inheritance support\n5. **ITypeSymbolExtensions.cs**: Updated `IsServiceParameter` to use `InheritsFrom` instead of exact equality\n6. **Added comprehensive test**: `SupportsDerivedFromKeyedServicesAttribute` validates the fix end-to-end\n\n## Testing\n\n- All existing tests continue to pass\n- New test confirms derived attributes are properly detected across all components\n- Comprehensive validation across MVC, HTTP Extensions, Request Delegate Generators, and Validation generators\n- No breaking changes to existing functionality\n\nThis enables developers to create extensible service injection attributes while maintaining full backward compatibility and framework support.\n\nFixes #63113.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

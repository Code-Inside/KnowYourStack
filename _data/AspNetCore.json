I have a block of code to show Notifications in an MVC app. I am upgrading the .Net 4.72 version to .Net5 (yes, I'm brave). But when I try to include the Razor block for drawing <li> elements using vars created in @{} at the head. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that though it displays the \"would you like to run the last successful build prompt\" it shows no errors. I have had issues where the Razor would cause a trackable error, this one gives no error in the Error List. The code is all running in the _Layout page and works fine in a deployed site using MVC 5 and .Net 4.72 (www.ebonfemme.com)\r\n\r\nI have searched and searched to attempt to find if there is some type of regression where .Net Core 5 MVC does not \"like\" having global vars accessed in the _Layout page. I am attaching the code as the best example. I have found a work-around but am hoping I can go back as the work-around caused other required changes.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nA repro is just for me a matter of uncommenting the Razor. The site will still run but it won't display the Notification div.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n<!-- \r\nThere are no exceptions thrown and no errors displayed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- ASP.NET Core version 5\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   5.0.104\r\n Commit:    ca6b6acadb\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.104\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 5.0.4\r\n  Commit:  f27d337295\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.407 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.102 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.104 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.24 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.26 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.24 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.26 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.24 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.26 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-  WIn10 VS 2019 Professional\r\n[_Layout -

However I can't get the integrity check to pass.\r\n\r\nI tried all the troubleshooting tips and even the `integrity.ps1` script, but that doesn't (even after one temp path change) seem to work well on Linux:\r\n```\r\n$ pwsh -File integrity.ps1 https://staging.dev.revolutionarygamesstudio.com/ publish\r\nInvoke-WebRequest: /home/hhyyrylainen/Projects/ThriveDevCenter/Client/bin/Release/net5.0/integrity.ps1:110                                                    Line |                                                                                                                                                         110 |  … viceWorkerAssetsResponse = Invoke-WebRequest $serviceWorkerAssetsUrl;                                                                                    |                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                     | Response status code does not indicate success: 404 (Not Found).

So it looks like the publish command doesn't calculate the hashes correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is the first hash in my blazor.boot.json:\r\n```\r\n\"Microsoft.TestPlatform.PlatformAbstractions.dll\": \"sha256-pMsMKv33\\/RjHY29C\\/QzodKJ8YQ1sOg17f3Zwa6y0N\\/Q=\",\r\n```\r\nAnd it seems to be incorrect (and this is just running the `dotnet publish -c Release` and nothing extra, even after a fresh re-clone it doesn't work). As this is what I get when I manually calculate the hash:\r\n```sh\r\n$ echo \"sha256-$(openssl dgst -sha256 -binary Microsoft.TestPlatform.PlatformAbstractions.dll | openssl base64 -A)\"\r\nsha256-VBEP5zNDa+gV0ghxCrL40DtQD7Ziwlw5+AJolnuguHo=\r\n```\r\nand that is also what Chrome reports as the hash that it calculated in the error message.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nWe ❤ code!

I though that as I don't use a static index.html (as some people referred to that regarding this issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19828) that deleting that from the template would maybe do something, but it doesn't. I couldn't test by dropping in my current `_Host.cshtml` file as it needs some changes to run without my other code.\r\n\r\nI found one more related issue, but none of the suggestions in it worked either: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/28692\r\n\r\nIt does say, that you don't want to look at my project, but here's the steps to see the problem:\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone git@github.com:Revolutionary-Games/ThriveDevCenter.git DevTest --branch blazor\r\ncd DevTest/\r\ndotnet publish -c Release\r\necho \"sha256-$(openssl dgst -sha256 -binary Client/bin/Release/net5.0/publish/wwwroot/_framework/Microsoft.TestPlatform.PlatformAbstractions.dll | openssl base64 -A)\"\r\n```\r\nFor reference the current latest commit is: `9e4aef415e3088fb526092d71e08e18a9c37995a`\r\n\r\nAnd then check that `Client/bin/Release/net5.0/publish/wwwroot/_framework/blazor.boot.json` has a different hash for that dll file.\r\n\r\nSomeone suggested to make a script that calculates the right hashes and updates blazor.boot.json: https://swimburger.net/blog/dotnet/fix-blazor-webassembly-pwa-integrity-checks which I'll probably do if no one can help me with this, though it doesn't seem very optimal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n```\r\nFailed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource 'https://staging.dev.revolutionarygamesstudio.com/_framework/Microsoft.TestPlatform.PlatformAbstractions.dll' with computed SHA-256 integrity 'VBEP5zNDa+gV0ghxCrL40DtQD7Ziwlw5+AJolnuguHo='.

The steps go like this:\r\n\r\n- Store a reference to the existing body\r\n- Replace the body with the new stream\r\n- Execute user code\r\n- Grab the contents of the body stream and copy it to the previous stream\r\n- Restore the previous body in a finally so exceptional cases are handled\r\n- Don't forget to dispose any streams created\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    var previous = context.Response.Body;\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        using var stream = new FileBufferingWriteStream();\r\n        context.Response.Body = stream;\r\n        await next();\r\n        await stream.CopyToAsync(previous);\r\n    }\r\n    finally\r\n    {\r\n         context.Response.Body = previous;\r\n    }  \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis code today is very manual and we could instead make it a bit more pleasant with some new APIs. \r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nPlease provide the specific public API signature diff that you are proposing. For example:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http\r\n{\r\n    public class HttpResponse\r\n    {\r\n+      public ResponseBodyScope UseBody(Stream stream);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n+    public struct ResponseBodyScope : IDisposable, IAsyncDisposable\r\n+    {\r\n+         public Stream PreviousBody { get; }\r\n+         public Stream CurrentBody { get; }\r\n+         public void Dispose();\r\n+         public ValueTask DisposeAsync();\r\n+    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\napp.Use(async (context, next) =>\r\n{\r\n    using var scope = context.Response.UseBody(new FileBufferingWriteStream());\r\n    await next();\r\n    await scope.CurrentBody.CopyToAsync(scope.PreviousBody);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nAn alternative might be an explicit push/pop style API but that wouldn't automagically handle the pop in the failure case.\r\n\r\nWe may also want to consider a mode that auto-flushes to the previous response body but then failure cases also get weird (did you want to flush the response on failure?)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/31146","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add API to help set and revert response bodies\" (#31146)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`. This will not affect any typical application code as it is only a detail of the low-level platform implementation.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe property `EventArgsType` described a nonstandard, Blazor-specific category name for groups of DOM event types. For example, the `click` and `mousedown` events were both mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `mouse`. Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`. There is no longer a need to supply a Blazor-specific category name, so the old property `EventArgsType` is removed.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nIn PR [#29993](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/29993) we have introduced support for custom event arguments classes. As part of this, we no longer rely on all events fitting into a predefined set of categories. The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

All breaking changes to nullability annotations will be aggregated into this issue throughout the course of .NET 6.0.**_\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0, we have been applying nullability annotations to parts of ASP.NET Core. From the outset of this effort, [we anticipated that mistakes would be made](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/api-guidelines/nullability.md#breaking-change-guidance) in these annotations and fixes would need to be made. In .NET 6.0, we are updating some annotations that have been previously applied. Some of these changes are considered source breaking changes because it leads to the APIs being incompatible or more restrictive, or could result in build-time warnings when used in projects that have nullable reference types enabled.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27564 for further discussions.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe affected APIs had incorrect nullable reference type annotations and build warnings were either absent or incorrect.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNew build warnings will be produced and incorrect build warnings will no longer be produced for the affected APIs.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThrough feedback and further testing, the nullable annotations for the affected APIs were determined to be inaccurate.

For example, if a razor class library defined a static web asset to be served under `/folder/file.txt` and the host placed a file under `wwwroot/folder/file.txt` the file on the server would silently override the file on the Razor Class Library or Blazor Webassembly application.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core will now correctly detect when this issue happens and inform of the conflict so that users can be aware and take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis was a bug in the implementation, we never intended for static web assets to be \"overridable\" by files on the wwwroot host of the project since that leads to errors that are hard to diagnose and can result in undefined behavior changes when applications are published.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason for a file on a Razor Class Library to conflict with a file on the host by default since they are prefixed with `_content/${PackageId}` unless we are discussing Blazor Webassembly applications, which get placed by default at the root of the host url space, which makes conflicts easier. (For example, Blazor Webassembly Applications contain a favicon.ico that the host might also include in their wwwroot folder).\r\n\r\nIf the source of the conflict is a file in a Razor Class Library it normally means there is some code that copies the assets from the library into the wwwroot folder of the project. We don't recommend developers doing that since it defeats one of the main goals of static web assets which is that files don't have to be copied around, which is fundamental to get updates on the browser when the contents are updated without having to trigger a new compilation.\r\n\r\nIf despite that you want to preserve this behavior and maintain the file on the host, you can do so by removing the file from the list of static web assets with a custom MSBuild target.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the file on the razor class library or the blazor webassembly file instead of the file from the host project, just remove the file from the host project.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updated validation logic for Static Web Assets\" (#443)"},{"Id":"724794249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T19:05:24","Actor":"tatti9018","Number":"442","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"Help with feature “Control Startup class activation”\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n            .ConfigureWebHost(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.UseStartup(context => new Startup(logger));\r\n            })\r\n            .Build();\r\n```\r\nWhen I use Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly”, I get error: ‘IHostBuilder’ does not contain a definition for ‘ConfigureWebHostDefaults’\r\nWhen I set Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, project see ConfigureWebHostDefaults, but project doesn’t work….","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/442","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work\" (#442)"},{"Id":"712253766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-30T20:21:51","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5","State":"open","Body":"## Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5\r\n\r\n.NET 5 introduces a variety of [new Blazor features](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514), some of which are not compatible with certain older browsers.

Starting from ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1, all of those readonly public fields have changed to readonly public properties.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect this change to affect many developers because:\r\n\r\n * Any application or library that simply uses `.razor` files (or even manual `RenderTreeBuilder` calls) to define its components would not be referencing this type directly\r\n * The `RenderTreeFrame` type itself is regarded as an implementation detail, not intended for use outside the framework. ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later includes an analyzer that issues compiler warnings if the type is being used directly.\r\n * Even if you do reference `RenderTreeFrame` directly, this change is binary-breaking but not source-breaking. That is, your existing source code will still compile and behave properly. You will only encounter an issue if compiling against the 3.x framework and then running those binaries against the 5.0 RC1 and later framework.\r\n\r\n## Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1\r\n\r\n## Old behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` were defined as fields, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\n## New behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` are defined as properties with the same names as before, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\nIf older precompiled code has not been recompiled since this change, it may throw an exception similar to *MissingFieldException: Field not found: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame.FrameType'*.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary in order to implement some high-impact performance improvements in Blazor component rendering on ASP.NET Core 5.0 while retaining the same level of safety and encapsulation as before.\r\n\r\n## Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Blazor developers will not be affected and do not need to take action. This is most likely to affect library/package authors, but still only rarely. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* If you are developing an application, and either staying on ASP.NET Core 3.x or upgrading to 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to make any changes to your own code.\r\n   * However if you depend on a library that needs to upgrade to account for this change, then you would need to update to a newer version of that library.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support only ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to take any action. Just ensure that your `csproj` declares the `TargetFramework` value `net5.0`.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support both ASP.NET Core 3.x *and* 5.0, then check whether or not your code attempts to read any of the members of `RenderTreeFrame` (for example, evaluating `someRenderTreeFrame.FrameType`).\r\n    * Most libraries will not do that. This includes libraries that contain `.razor` components. In this case you don't need to take any action.\r\n    * However, if your library does do that, then you will need to use multitargeting to support both `netstandard2.1` and `net5.0`. First, in your `csproj`, replace the existing `<TargetFramework>` with `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`. Then instead of referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` with a fixed version number such as 3.0.0, use a conditional reference to account for both versions you wish to support. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"3.0.0\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"5.0.0-rc.1.*\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' != 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further clarification, see this [diff showing how @jsakamoto already upgraded his `Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement` library in this way](https://github.com/jsakamoto/Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement/commit/090df430ba725f9420d412753db8104e8c32bf51).\r\n\r\n## Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fields on RenderTreeFrame have become properties\" (#438)"},{"Id":"696062913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T17:46:46","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the default behavior of `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBy default, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found (i.e. the exception handler returns a 404) when the middleware executes. To allow 404 responses to be returned by the exception handler, please configure the option `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. When this option is set to true, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run. The exception thrown will be handled by the server. For example, the exception will be converted to a 500 error response by Kestrel HTTP server or HTTP.SYS server. \r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility using the current behavior, where a 404 response from the exception handler is allowed, please set `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`.

Remove uses of `DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware`in your app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n    {\r\n        app.UseDatabaseErrorPage();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Ensure `DeveloperExeptionPage` and `MigrationsEndpoint` are added to your app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n    {\r\n        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\r\n        app.UseMigrationsEndPoint();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add `DatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter` to your services:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n{\r\n    services.AddDatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter();\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n  [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.diagnostics.entityframeworkcore.databaseerrorpagemiddleware)\r\n  [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.DatabaseErrorPageExtensions.UseDatabaseErrorPage`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.databaseerrorpageextensions.usedatabaseerrorpage)\r\n\r\nSee discussion at: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24987\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/432","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting DatabaseErrorPage middleware\" (#432)"},{"Id":"677137375","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T19:27:08","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"431","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1597 | ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1597 | ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests.

ASP.NET Core and other web frameworks accommodate disallowed characters in these fields by encoding them when creating a response cookie and decoding when reading a request cookie.\r\n \r\nThis encoding behavior is being changed in response to a security concern.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23578 for discussion.\r\n \r\n### Version introduced\r\n \r\n5.0\r\n \r\n### Old behavior\r\n \r\nResponse cookie names would be encoded, and request cookie names would be decoded.\r\n \r\n### New behavior\r\n \r\nIn .NET 5.0 we will remove the cookie name encoding and decoding.

This attack requires a secondary exploit in order to inject the spoofed cookies, such as an XSS vulnerability in the web site. These prefixes are not used by default in ASP.NET Core or Microsoft.Owin libraries or templates.\r\n \r\nAll versions of ASP.NET Core and Microsoft.Owin are affected.\r\n \r\n### Recommended action\r\n \r\nApplications moving to .NET 5.0 should ensure that their cookie names conform to the [token spec requirements](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.2): ASCII characters excluding controls and separators `\"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"@\" | \",\" | \";\" | \":\" | \"\\\" | <\"> | \"/\" | \"[\" | \"]\" | \"?\" | \"=\" | \"{\" | \"}\" | SP | HT`.

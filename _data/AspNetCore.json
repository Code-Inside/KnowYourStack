It logs the exception to the browser console and closes the connection. \r\nRight before closing the connection, it can send the exception to the backend. \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/55027","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Notify Unhandled Circuit Exception\" (#55027)"},{"Id":"2233373919","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T12:52:12","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"55026","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/xdt","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:528824d6-6b35-4682-f426-08dbf65e5bea)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/xdt\r\n- **Subscription**: 528824d6-6b35-4682-f426-08dbf65e5bea\r\n- **Build**: 20240408.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: April 8, 2024 12:57:49 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 282e0064c30d5cef9b1c1cabb12ef6b55775c54d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.xdt**: [from 9.0.0-preview.24204.1 to 9.0.0-preview.24208.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.Web.Xdt**: [from 9.0.0-preview.24204.1 to 9.0.0-preview.24208.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/xdt/compare/67956470cc...282e0064c3\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:528824d6-6b35-4682-f426-08dbf65e5bea)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/55026","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/xdt\" (#55026)"},{"Id":"2232022702","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T09:47:02","Actor":"oskarjf","Number":"55019","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor server side app running under IIS","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\n.NET v8, IIS v10\r\n\r\nI've got a server-side Blazor app running under IIS and I'm having some issues with it.

If Brotli isn't supported by the client, compression defaults to Gzip when the client supports Gzip compression.\r\n\r\nI am the Server and the client and have the latest updates of everything on Windows 10. I've enabled static content compression and dynamic content compression in IIS. \r\nI use `AddResponseCompression` before `builder.Build` and `UseResponseCompression` after `UseStaticFiles` but all MIME Types get Gzip `Content-Encoding` in browser. I found that the html itself get `br` encoding.\r\n\r\nI even try these but none of them helped:\r\n`builder.Services.AddResponseCompression(options =>\r\n{\r\n    options.Providers.Add<BrotliCompressionProvider>();\r\n});`\r\n\r\n`builder.Services.AddResponseCompression(options =>\r\n{\r\n    options.MimeTypes = new[] {\r\n        \"text/html\",\r\n        \"text/css\",\r\n        ..\r\n        .\r\n    };\r\n    options.Providers.Add<BrotliCompressionProvider>();\r\n});`\r\n\r\n`builder.Services.AddResponseCompression(options =>\r\n{\r\n    options.Providers.Add<BrotliCompressionProvider>();\r\n    options.Providers.Add<GzipCompressionProvider>();\r\n});`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI Expect to see `br` Encoding on all other file types like: CSS, JS, JSON and so on.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\njust use normal response compression on ASP.Net Core 8. Windows 10 Latest Updates.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.202\n\n### Anything

`IUtf8SpanParsable<T>`/`ISpanParsable<T>` over `IParsable<T>` if a type implements it","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a particular type does not have `BindAsync` specified, which is often the case for libraries that cannot assume `Sdk.Web` project dependency, ASP.NET Core will try to bind parameters of such types to `IParsable<T>` interface implementation.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the type is representable in or parsable from UTF-8, ASP.NET Core may be able to feed the `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` observing the input buffer directly, bypassing string allocation and/or transcoding.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nGiven an example scenario:\r\n```cs\r\nvar app = WebApplication\r\n    .CreateSlimBuilder(args)\r\n    .Build();\r\n    \r\napp.MapGet(\"/echo/{name}\", (U8String name) =>\r\n    TypedResults.Bytes(u8($\"Hello, {name}!\"), contentType: \"text/plain\"));\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe type `U8String` implements `IParsable<T>`, `ISpanParsable<T>` and `IUtf8SpanParsable<T>`. Currently, only `IParsable<T>` participates in binding method resolution. Both `ISpanParsable<T>` and `IUtf8SpanParsable<T>` could participate in the process, allowing for more efficient binding for types that do not need either `string` itself or UTF-16. \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility with pre-.NET 8 targets, the binding can be duck-typed similar to the way it works for `TryParse` itself.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/55016","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider binding to `IUtf8SpanParsable<T>`/`ISpanParsable<T>` over `IParsable<T>` if a type

bug\r\n\r\nI've been trying to integrate QuickGrid component into [Oqtane](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework) but, because of the decoupled and modular nature of the project, it requires extracting and manually referencing the staticwebassets of external razor class libraries.\r\n\r\nI've replicated the issue in a standard Blazor Web App with Server interactivity.\r\n\r\nI've added to _content the assets required by QuickGrid and referenced them in my App.razor:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/90258222/008f071a-60f2-46e9-ac22-c2ef6f551f81)\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n

(QuickGrid.razor.js) but the component is not found (even after installing the NuGet package and adding it to the Imports), trying to compile the project results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Error BLAZOR106 The JS module file 'MY_PATH\\wwwroot\\ _content\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.QuickGrid\\QuickGrid.razor.js' was defined but no associated razor component or

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

Since the default internal behavior could easily change, was decided to avoid relying on the internal default implementation and setting the `StatusCode` to the expected `200 OK`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you are broken by this change, as the example mentioned before:\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n    Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n    return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will need to change your Controller Action. These are some possible options that will keep the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return Accepted(new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status202Accepted, new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic Model Get()\r\n{\r\n   Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n   return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC/API Controller actions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/485","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ActionResult<T> set StatusCode to 200\" (#485)"},{"Id":"1190169916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-01T19:03:58","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"484","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThe mechanism to detect an empty request `body` during the MVC Model Binding now uses the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody), that is currently implemented by the following behavior:\r\n\r\n- `true` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with a non-zero `Content-Length` or a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that did not set the `END_STREAM` flag on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\n- `false` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with no `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header, or the `Content-Length` is `0`.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with `Connection: Upgrade` (e.g. WebSockets). There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

Eg.:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-0f87920dc675fdfdf8d7638d3be66577-bd6bdbf32d21b714-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"\": [\r\n+      \"A non-empty request body is required.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"value\": [\r\n      \"The value field is required.\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is an alignment with other parts of the framework that were already using the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody) and also a fix to a reported issue dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29570\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nNo change is required, however, if you getting an unexpected behavior is recommended to review if your client's requests are sending the appropriated headers/information.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC Action Controllers","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/484","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding\" (#484)"},{"Id":"1154726545","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T01:08:45","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"483","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Event IDs for some Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core log messages changed","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs part of updating the Microsoft.AspNetcore.Mvc.Core assembly to use `LoggerMessageAttribute`, we discovered logger event Ids being reused within a single log category.

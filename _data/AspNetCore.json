Open the solution, observe compilation fails.\n2. Change version of the package in project from `2.3.0` to `2.2.0` \n3. Observe compilation now succeeds\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\nNET472\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIt's not clear to me exactly why these specific types are missing, but I'm currently assuming it must be something related to trimming that removed these types during build.\n\nI actually downloaded the nuget package directly to make sure those types were really not there, and confirmed they are also missing from the documentation XML inside of the package, meaning they were eliminated completely before the final `dll` was generated somehow.\n\nUpgrading the consuming project makes no difference whatsoever (I tried just to see if it would make a difference, from `net472` to `net9.0` for example).\n\nThe latest version from the AspNetCore.AppRef is working just fine (again, tested by removing the explicit package, and changing to the `.Web` project SDK).\n\nThe only workaround for us at the moment seems to be to completely remove our custom API convention class. Nothing else was affected apparently.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61955","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Api Convention-related types missing from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` `2.3.0`\" (#61955)"},{"Id":"3068718227","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-17T14:30:13","Actor":"zachneu","Number":"61962","RawContent":null,"Title":"Two-way-binding for SupplyParameterFromQuery in Blazor","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

I set up such code based on the sample from article above and instead using `.ToHtmlString()` used `.WriteHtmlTo(TextWriter)` to write the report directly to the file. Unfortunately, from my testing it appears it does not matter what writer is used the memory allocation made by the renderer itself is significant.

I configured the MSAL cache to use localStorage by setting the CacheLocation in MsalProviderOptions like this:\n\n```\nbuilder.Services.AddMsalAuthentication(options =>\n{\n    options.ProviderOptions.Cache.CacheLocation = \"localStorage\";\n    // other config...\n});\n```\n\nThis works well initially—tokens are stored and retrieved as expected. However, after a few hours (presumably when the token expires), the app doesn't seem to automatically acquire a new token. Even when I try to sign out manually using:\n\n`await SignOutManager.SetSignOutState();`\n\n...any pages decorated with `[Authorize]` still redirect to the NotAuthorized view. The only workaround I’ve found is to manually clear localStorage in the browser, which obviously isn’t ideal.\n\nAny insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior when using localStorage as the cacheLocation in a Blazor WebAssembly app with MSAL should be:\n\n- **Persistent Token Storage**: Tokens (ID, access, and refresh) should persist across browser sessions as long as they are valid and not manually cleared, since localStorage is not cleared on tab or browser close.\n- **Automatic Silent Token Renewal**: When an access token expires, MSAL should attempt to silently acquire a new token using the refresh token (if available and valid), without requiring user interaction.\n- **Graceful Sign-Out**: Calling SignOutManager.SetSignOutState() should clear the authentication state and redirect the user appropriately. After sign-out, protected routes decorated with [Authorize] should redirect to the login page or a configured fallback, not remain stuck on a NotAuthorized view.\n- **No Manual Storage Clearing Required**: Users should not need to manually clear localStorage to resolve expired token issues. The library should handle token lifecycle management internally.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n1.

Please describe the problem.\n\nOverall, Feature #59456 - Get rid of Blazor.boot.json has improved load times and reduced network requests.\n\nHowever, one consequence of embedding the blazor.boot.json manifest internally to a dotnet.*.js file , is that the manifest can only be extracted by build tools using text matching methods from the js file, which is not robust.\n\nBlazor.boot.json has previously been available from the file system, and provided a reliable json model and manifest list of framework files, that could provide the authoritative source for bundling and compression lists. ( Bundling is absolutely essential for resource constrained or api limited targetted systems)\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe manifest file (blazor.boot.json) was, previously to Net10, an external document available for use especially by build and deployment tools.\n\nContinue to make the manifest document readily available. This could be by:\n\n1) A build option, e.g **_OutputManifestToFileSystem_**, expected to be placed under the new tag **_OverrideHtmlAssetPlaceholders_.** This tag will mean 'also', so the manifest will continue to be copied to dotnet.*.js, if opted in, and also to file system (as per previous behaviour)\n\n2) **_Or:_** Formalise the text parameters around the embedded file, within dotnet.*.js. Currently I need to use 'withConfig' and /*json-end*/  to extract. This option is less desirable but easier maybe. \nOne technique I have used is to place the string  in a javascript function - in this way the boundary is the javascript function name, so there is some protection about the text boundary being changed (by your team):\n  function BlazorBootJson() {    \n      return '{...}';\n   }\n\nie Tt.withConfig(BlazorBootJson());\n\nYeh, 2 is not great. Maybe 1.\n\n### Additional context\n\nMany Blazor systems and particularly WebAssembly variants are deployed to locked down and/or resource constrained environments. There are a number of Enterprise systems (even from Microsoft) that have many limits, including web resource constraints to 5MB, files limited only to html and js, and concurrent api throttling limits (which can easily be hit by a call centre opening at 9:00AM, for example)\n\nBundling (meaning grouping, compression and embedding), is essential to these deployments, and reading the blazor.boot.json as the authoritative list is a crucial part of this tooling.\n\nI suggest that blazor.boot.json be considered an 'external' type document, with a known json model that is in use out in the wild.\n\nSlightly off-topic: can I also suggest you be very cautious about changing the Blazor.Start overrides, if at all. It works extremely well as is, especially with the caching of the Wasm assemblies, and it is essential to my application and I would expect a lot of other people's as well. \nI will emphasise again how well it works: I have never seen it ask for a file it did not have already, and when it does make a request, it reliably waits for all of the cache lookups and in depth api calls that I tack onto the process.

This makes it **impossible to pre-register a redirect URI** for login flows, which are required to match exactly by identity providers.\n\n---\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nI expect to be able to:\n\n* Debug my Blazor WebAssembly app normally\n* Use OpenID Connect login\n* Register a known, stable redirect URI in the identity provider (e.g., `https://localhost:5005/authentication/callback`)\n\n---\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\nBlazor WASM debugging launches the app on a random port with each run, like:\n\n```\nhttps://localhost:51783/\n```\n\nThis breaks the OpenID Connect flow because:\n\n* The identity provider requires a *static*, pre-registered `redirect_uri`\n* The app’s real port is not known until the browser opens\n\nAs a result, login fails with `invalid_redirect_uri` or requires unsafe workarounds like wildcard redirects (which most providers disallow or OpenIddict refuses to match).\n\n---\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n* Secure login flows (e.g., using OpenIddict, Duende, Auth0) require strict redirect URI matching\n* Random ports make reliable debugging impossible\n* There is no current way to *fix the debug port* for Blazor WASM apps in Visual Studio\n\n---\n\n**Workarounds attempted:**\n\n* Tried to use `launchSettings.json` to fix the port → ignored by Visual Studio for Blazor WASM\n* Tried dynamic redirect URI patching → doesn't help since identity provider also requires known `redirect_uri`\n* Tried `IHttpContextAccessor` or `OpenIddictClientService` tricks → adds too much complexity\n\n---\n\n**Repro steps:**\n\n1. Create a Blazor WASM project with OpenId Connect login (using OpenIddict or any OIDC provider)\n2. Launch in debug mode (F5)\n3. Observe that the app uses a random port\n4. Attempt login — you'll see a failure due to `redirect_uri` mismatch\n\n---\n\n**Suggestion:**\n\nPlease allow Blazor WebAssembly apps to:\n\n* Set a fixed HTTPS port (via `launchSettings.json` or Aspire config)\n* Or reuse the same debug port across runs\n* Or expose the actual launch port to the app before startup\n\n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/9/2025, 05:17 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

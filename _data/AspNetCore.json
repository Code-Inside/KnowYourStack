But I imagine that many will combine the usage of the `[Required]` attribute and the `required` keyword because the alternative is not beautiful (it feels dirty to write `default!`):\n```csharp\npublic class Order\n{\n    [Required]\n    public string OrderNumber { get; set; } = default!;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI have made a minimal repo for this here: https://github.com/KristofferStrube/ModelValidationInApiWithRequiredProperty\n\nIn the repo, I have also added tests that show that the Minimal API does not return problem details in the specific scenario.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"model validation for classes with members that have the required keyword is handled differently in Controller API and Minimal API\" (#64139)"},{"Id":"3541572777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-22T16:38:38","Actor":"EmperorArthur","Number":"64138","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature Request: Cache-Control Header For Static Files","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

When a non-generic `Task` is returned from the invocation of a method through reflection, it will always return `Task<VoidTaskResult>` and therefore consider `VoidTaskResult` the generic argument.\n\nThis behavior results in a different response from [GetTaskResult](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/JSInterop/Microsoft.JSInterop/src/Infrastructure/TaskGenericsUtil.cs). Instead of `null`, it will return an instance of `VoidTaskResult`. The caller of this method serializes the value as json, and instead of writing a null token, will write `{ }`, by being provided an empty struct.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n#### 1: Returning an instance of `VoidTaskResult` is expected, and `{}` is returned by the serializer as intended.\n\nIf this is the intended behavior, it points at redundancy in [TaskGenericsUtil](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/JSInterop/Microsoft.JSInterop/src/Infrastructure/TaskGenericsUtil.cs). The VoidTaskResultGetter is never used because the condition to reach this case is never true.\n\n#### 2: Returning an instance of `VoidTaskResult` is not expected, and `null` should be serialized instead.\n\nIn this scenario, `VoidTaskResult` should not be returned by [GetTaskResult](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/JSInterop/Microsoft.JSInterop/src/Infrastructure/TaskGenericsUtil.cs). \n\nUnfortunately however, thanks to `VoidTaskResult` being an internal struct in runtime, there is no 'sane' solution to make it this behavior work as intended, resulting in the consideration of a type name comparison.\n\nA better way were to look at runtime directly, and solve the problem where it starts. By making `VoidTaskResult` public, it allows developers outside of the runtime internals to compare against this type and process it by intention.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/csmir/JSInteropVTSBehavior \n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\nAny supported version.

The produced document is unintuitive and makes using tooling (E.g. API SDK generators) challenging.\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nAs I understand it, the reason that the document is generated this way is to be more true to how requests are received and processed by .NET => \"the parameter is provided as a string but I'm going to try and parse it as an int\". However, it's not physically possible to provide a http request query string with anything other than a string. Tooling dependent on OpenAPI schemas may not be properly equipped to deal with these types - for example, I use SDK/API client generators to keep type safety across my web services. Currently HeyAPI (formerly known as openapi-ts) does not properly handle these types as it is not the expected way for OpenAPI to describe the type of a numeric parameter.\n\nImagine a text input on a website with a label \"Numbers Only\", which displayed an error if anything other than a number was entered. A human interacting with that text box would read the label and see an error if they entered anything but a number.\n\nNow imagine that the input instead has the label \"Numbers and Text Only\" but keeps the same error message - any sane, logical person would see this and be confused as to why the label is saying something that is clearly untrue.\n\nI know that's a bit of a far fetched example but I think it displays the sentiment. I think that hybrid types like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"page\",\n  \"in\": \"query\",\n  \"description\": \"Page index to fetch\",\n  \"required\": true,\n  \"schema\": {\n    \"maximum\": 100,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"pattern\": \"^-?(?:0|[1-9]\\\\d*)$\",\n    \"type\": [\n      \"integer\",\n      \"string\"\n    ],\n    \"format\": \"int32\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\ncause unnecessary confusion, especially considering that there are examples all over OpenAPI documentation of query string parameters being typed as integers, E.g.:\n\n```yaml\nparameters:\n  - in: query\n    name: limit\n    schema:\n      type: integer\n      minimum: 1\n    example: 20\n```\n\nI understand that there is probably a reason for this beyond my understanding - so I propose an option where a user can decide whether hybrid types are generated or not.\n\n## Examples\n\n```c#\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenApi(opts =>\n{\n    opts.DoNotGenerateHybridTypes();\n});\n```\n\n[This bug](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61038#issue-2935292563) is related but reported as bug instead of a feature request. The mentioned solution for the bug is to use [JsonSerializerOptions.NumberHandling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.numberhandling?view=net-10.0#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-numberhandling), I think it would be more clear to have a global setting for this instead of changing JSON Serializer Options either globally or per property.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64136","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"OpenApi Hybrid Type Options\" (#64136)"},{"Id":"3537437339","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-22T09:47:05","Actor":"J-Arturo-Sira","Number":"64130","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migration from .NET 8 to .NET 9 gives an error when publishing","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI have a Blazor PWA application that worked normally in AWS Amplify.

Please describe the problem.\n\n### Description\nWhen using Blazor WASM form validation with complex nested objects that may replace instances at runtime,\ninputs derived from `InputBase<TValue>` can display **stale UI and validation state**.\n\n`InputBase.SetParametersAsync` assigns its `FieldIdentifier` only once on initialization. If the underlying **FieldIdentifier.Model** object instance changes, the component keeps using the old (Model, FieldName) pair. As a result, `EditContext.GetValidationMessages()` may return an empty set,\nbut the input remains visually invalid because its cached `FieldIdentifier` still points to the previous instance.\n\n### Reproduction example\nLet's say we have a checkout form where user has to enter amount and select a payment method.\nModels would look like this.\n\n```\npublic class CheckoutForm\n{\n    public PaymentMethod Payment { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic abstract class PaymentMethod\n{\n    [Required]\n    [Range(1, 999, ErrorMessage = \"Amount must be between 1 and 999.\")]\n    public int Amount { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class CardPayment : PaymentMethod\n{\n    // whatever fields for card payment\n}\n\npublic class PayPalPayment : PaymentMethod\n{\n    // whatever fields for paypal payment\n}\n```\n\nAnd a code that performs payment method change:\n```\nprivate void HandlePaymentMethodChange(PaymentType type) {\n    if (type == PaymentType.Card) {\n        FormModel.Payment = new CardPayment {\n             Amount = FormModel.Payment.Amount\n        }\n    }\n\n   if (type == PaymentType.PayPal) {\n       FormModel.Payment = new PayPalPayment {\n            Amount = FormModel.Payment.Amount\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n- Enter an invalid value in Amount (e.g., value less than 1 or more than 999).\n- Switch from `CardPayment` to `PayPalPayment` the Payment property reference changes).\n- Enter a valid numeric value.\n\n**Expected**\nThe input should reflect the new, valid state of the new Payment instance.\n\n**Actual**\nThe `EditContext` has no validation messages, but the input still displays as invalid.\nThe old `FieldIdentifier` is still used by the input component.\n\n\n### Current workaround\nUsage of `key` attribute with a value of model instance resolves issue because each time model is changed, the subtree is fully re-created leading to re-initialization of `FieldIdentifiers`.\n\n```\n<EditContext>\n    <PaymentMethodComponent @key=\"@FormModel.Payment\" />\n</EdiContext>\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe solution would be to update `InputBase.SetParametersAsync` code by providing additional check for reference equality between previous FieldIdentifier.Model and current one.\n\n```\npublic override Task SetParametersAsync(ParameterView parameters)\n{\n    // ... old code\n\n    // NEW: detect instance swap for the owner of ValueExpression's final member\n    if (ValueExpression is not null)\n    {\n        var newField = FieldIdentifier.Create(ValueExpression);\n\n        // If the owning instance or the field changed, switch identifiers\n        if (!ReferenceEquals(newField.Model, FieldIdentifier.Model))\n        {\n            // Clear parsing messages we (this input) may have added for the OLD field\n            if (_parsingValidationMessages is not null)\n            {\n                _parsingValidationMessages.Clear(FieldIdentifier);\n                EditContext?.NotifyValidationStateChanged();\n            }\n\n            // Switch to NEW field\n            FieldIdentifier = newField;\n\n            // Reset parsing/display state so we don't carry stale UI forward\n            _parsingFailed = false;\n            _previousParsingAttemptFailed = false;\n            _incomingValueBeforeParsing = null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n###

wasm app to a folder at all. In my attempts and experiments compared between vs2022 and vs2026, every version of dotnet blazor wasm app cannot work in vs2026, so I consider that is a bug of vs2026, not of dotnet10rc2. Both VS2022 and VS2026 are latest.\nTo reproduce the problem, follow this:\n1.  Install VS2022 and VS2026 with ASP.NET/Web Development feature.\n2.  Use VS2026 to make a new project from templete Blazor WebAssembly with dotnet8~dotnet10.\n3.  Go to VS2022 and open projects with dotnet8 or dotnet 9, and use the publish selection to publish this project to a folder, do same in VS2026, just have a more choice with project with dotnet10.\n4.  Compare the `wwwroot` `_frameworks` folder generated by vs2022 and vs2026.\n\nAfter this you should find that VS2026 only has serveral files in `_frameworks`, and VS2022 has the whole runtime. I think because of this difference, Cloudflare Pages run into a different condition. The web app generated by VS2022 runs well but generated by VS2026 has errors about `mono_wasm_load_runtime () failed` or `MIME type` or others.\n I find this by comparing a single project, Blazor WebAssembly App with dotnet9, published by VS2022 and VS2026 then upload to Cloudflare Pages. Only VS2022 could run well.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 10/21/2025, 05:40 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

Please describe the problem.\n\nI am using the AuthorizeRouteView to serve my routes and redirect to a login page if the user is not authenticated. However, I want to include an additional rule that certain pages (marked by a custom attribute) require the user to have set a certain metadata value, and if they have not, to redirect them to a page where they can set that value. The problem is, once authorization is confirmed, there is no place to add additional redirects, as the page is simply loaded. AuthorizeRouteView only takes child content for `NotAuthorized` and `Authorizing`, but this doesn't apply.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to be able to specify an `AfterAuthorized` delegate or RenderFragment that runs immediately before the route is processed. Something like this:\n\n```razor\n<Router AppAssembly=\"typeof(Program).Assembly\">\n    <Found Context=\"routeData\">\n        <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=\"routeData\" DefaultLayout=\"typeof(Layout.MainLayout)\">\n            <NotAuthorized>\n                <RedirectToLogin/>\n            </NotAuthorized>\n            <AfterAuthorized>\n                <CheckForCustomRedirect/>\n            </AfterAuthorized>\n        </AuthorizeRouteView>\n        <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=\"routeData\" Selector=\"h1\"/>\n    </Found>\n</Router>\n```\n\nRight now, my solution is to make my own subclass of RouteView that reimplements AuthorizeRouteView and does the thing that I want it to do, but AuthorizeRouteView relies on a lot of internal and/or sealed infrastructure, so it's difficult to ensure I've re-implemented everything correctly.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64124","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AuthorizeRouteView: Add capability to include additional redirects\" (#64124)"},{"Id":"3531057292","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T20:28:23","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"64112","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/extensions","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ea09839e-ece1-4cb6-b798-cd2130f3225c)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/extensions\n- **Subscription**: [ea09839e-ece1-4cb6-b798-cd2130f3225c](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=ea09839e-ece1-4cb6-b798-cd2130f3225c)\n- **Build**: [20251018.1](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2819194) ([287702](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/3883/github:dotnet:extensions/build/287702))\n- **Date Produced**: October 18, 2025 1:01:01 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [1dc5b3173d53e4e40c17d3775f370cd084aa0d64](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/commit/1dc5b3173d53e4e40c17d3775f370cd084aa0d64)\n- **Branch**: [main](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/tree/main)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - From [9.10.0-preview.1.25475.1 to 10.0.0-preview.1.25518.1][1]\n     - Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Hybrid\n     - Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Testing\n     - Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/compare/c4e57fb1e6...1dc5b3173d\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:ea09839e-ece1-4cb6-b798-cd2130f3225c)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64112","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/10.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/extensions\" (#64112)"},{"Id":"3533576380","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T19:03:24","Actor":"dbc2","Number":"64123","RawContent":null,"Title":"JsonPatch.SystemTextJson: When serializing a `JsonPatchDocument`, \"value\":null is incorrectly emitted for \"remove\", \"move\" and \"copy\" operations.","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThis is a follow-on issue related to [JsonPatch.SystemTextJson: When serializing a JsonPatchDocument, \"from\":null is incorrectly emitted for \"add\", \"remove\", \"replace\" and \"test\" operations. #63862](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63862).  Since there's already a pull opened for that issue, I'm opening a second issue.\n\nIn `.NET 10.0.0-rc.2.25502.107`, I am trying to manually create a [`JsonPatchDocument`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.jsonpatch.systemtextjson.jsonpatchdocument?view=aspnetcore-10.0) (rather than receive one created by a client).  I can do that quite easily, but when I serialize it using System.Text.Json, `\"value\": null` properties will be shown for operations that should not have a `\"value\"` property:\n\n -  \"remove\"\n -  \"move\"\n - \"copy\"\n\nFor instance, taking some examples from [JSON Patch RFC 6902](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902#section-4), if I try to create the following patch:\n\n```json\n[\n    { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": [ \"foo\", \"bar\" ] },\n    { \"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\" },\n    { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": 42 },\n    { \"op\": \"move\", \"from\": \"/a/b/c\", \"path\": \"/a/b/d\" },\n    { \"op\": \"copy\", \"from\": \"/a/b/c\", \"path\": \"/a/b/e\" },\n    { \"op\": \"test\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": \"foo\" },\n    { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/a/b/nullableString\", \"value\": null }\n]\n```\n\nUsing the following code:\n\n```\nJsonPatchDocument patchDocument = new ();\npatchDocument.Add(\"/a/b/c\", new [] {  \"foo\", \"bar\" });\npatchDocument.Remove(\"/a/b/c\");\npatchDocument.Replace(\"/a/b/c\", 42);\npatchDocument.Move(from: \"/a/b/c\", path: \"/a/b/d\");\npatchDocument.Copy(from: \"/a/b/c\", path: \"/a/b/e\");\npatchDocument.Test(\"/a/b/c\", \"foo\");\n//Validate that we can still patch in a null value\npatchDocument.Replace(\"/a/b/nullableString\", null);\n\nvar json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(patchDocument);\nConsole.WriteLine(json); // Prints a patch that includes several invalid \"value\":null properties\n```\n\nI will get the following invalid patch:\n\n```json\n[\n\t{\"value\":[\"foo\",\"bar\"],\"path\":\"/a/b/c\",\"op\":\"add\",\"from\":null},\n\t{\"value\":null,\"path\":\"/a/b/c\",\"op\":\"remove\",\"from\":null},\n\t{\"value\":42,\"path\":\"/a/b/c\",\"op\":\"replace\",\"from\":null},\n\t{\"value\":null,\"path\":\"/a/b/d\",\"op\":\"move\",\"from\":\"/a/b/c\"},\n\t{\"value\":null,\"path\":\"/a/b/e\",\"op\":\"copy\",\"from\":\"/a/b/c\"},\n\t{\"value\":\"foo\",\"path\":\"/a/b/c\",\"op\":\"test\",\"from\":null},\n\t{\"value\":null,\"path\":\"/a/b/nullableString\",\"op\":\"replace\",\"from\":null}\n]\n```\n\nAll but the last of those `\"value\":null` properties definitely should not be present as can be seen from the [RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902).  (The invalid `\"from\":null` properties are covered by the previous issue.)\n\nAs with Issue #63862, once again the problem is that the [Newtonsoft code](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/30000d883e06c122311a66894579bc12329a09d4/src/aspnetcore/src/Features/JsonPatch/src/Operations/Operation.cs) suppresses the unwanted `\"value\"` properties via [conditional serialization](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/conditionalproperties.htm#ShouldSerialize), specifically the [`ShouldSerializevalue()`](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/30000d883e06c122311a66894579bc12329a09d4/src/aspnetcore/src/Features/JsonPatch/src/Operations/Operation.cs#L68) method.  System.Text.Json, on the other hand, does not support conditional serialization automatically, so the  `\"value\":null` properties get serialized unconditionally.  (However, unlike Issue #63862. no useless `ShouldSerializeValue()` method was introduced.).  Some equivalent conditional serialization mechanism will be required by System.Text.Json.\n\nAlso, you might want to mark [`Operation.value`](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/30000d883e06c122311a66894579bc12329a09d4/src/aspnetcore/src/Features/JsonPatch.SystemTextJson/src/Operations/Operation.cs#L15) as nullable since it will be null for certain operations -- and **can** be null for **any** operation:\n\n    [JsonPropertyName(nameof(value))]\n    public object? value { get; set; }\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`\"value\"` properties should only be emitted for \"add\", \"replace\" and \"test\" operations.  Note however that a `null` value is a valid patch value for these operations, so you can't just unconditionally skip null values, you need to emulate the logic of [`ShouldSerializevalue()`](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/30000d883e06c122311a66894579bc12329a09d4/src/aspnetcore/src/Features/JsonPatch/src/Operations/Operation.cs#L68C17-L68C39) from the old Newtonsoft implementation.  You could have done that by making [`Operation`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.jsonpatch.systemtextjson.operations.operation?view=aspnetcore-10.0) polymorphic, however it might be too late to do that for .NET 10 -- and it might be too much of a breaking change for .NET 11+.\n\n [`Operation.value`](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/30000d883e06c122311a66894579bc12329a09d4/src/aspnetcore/src/Features/JsonPatch.SystemTextJson/src/Operations/Operation.cs#L15) should be marked as nullable.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```\n//dotnet new console\n//dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch.SystemTextJson --prerelease\n//dotnet add package NUnit\nusing System;\nusing System.Text.Json;\nusing System.Text.Json.Nodes;\n\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch.SystemTextJson;\n\nusing NUnit.Framework; // Throws NUnit.Framework.AssertionException\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"\\nExamples from https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902#section-4\");\n\nJsonPatchDocument patchDocument = new ();\npatchDocument.Add(\"/a/b/c\", new [] {  \"foo\", \"bar\" });\npatchDocument.Remove(\"/a/b/c\");\npatchDocument.Replace(\"/a/b/c\", 42);\npatchDocument.Move(from: \"/a/b/c\", path: \"/a/b/d\");\npatchDocument.Copy(from: \"/a/b/c\", path: \"/a/b/e\");\npatchDocument.Test(\"/a/b/c\", \"foo\");\n//Validate that we can still patch in a null value\npatchDocument.Replace(\"/a/b/nullableString\", null);\n\nvar json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(patchDocument);\nConsole.WriteLine(json); // Prints a patch that includes several invalid \"value\":null properties\n\nvar expectedJson = \n\"\"\"\n[\n    { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": [ \"foo\", \"bar\" ] },\n    { \"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\" },\n    { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": 42 },\n    { \"op\": \"move\", \"from\": \"/a/b/c\", \"path\": \"/a/b/d\" },\n    { \"op\": \"copy\", \"from\": \"/a/b/c\", \"path\": \"/a/b/e\" },\n    { \"op\": \"test\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": \"foo\" },\n    { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/a/b/nullableString\", \"value\": null }\n]\n\"\"\"; // Taken from  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902#section-4\n\nAssert.That(JsonNode.DeepEquals(JsonNode.Parse(expectedJson), JsonNode.Parse(json)));  // Fails due to multiple \"value\":null properties\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nNone (incorrect JSON is generated without an exception thrown.)\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI reproduced this using the command line only.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

As well as [HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder) and [Introducing WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model) for migration guides.\n\nBelow is an example of converting `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder`:\n\n**Before**\n```csharp\nvar hostBuilder = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup()\n    .UseKestrel();\n// Test code might use TestServer:\nvar testServer = new TestServer(hostBuilder);\n```\n\n**After**\n```csharp\nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseTestServer() // If using TestServer\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\nawait host.StartAsync();\n\nvar testServer = host.GetTestServer();\n```\n\nBoth Copilot and ChatGpt have given good results so far when asked to convert a WebHostBuilder example to use HostBuilder.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

It can be set directly or by registering a provider in the Dependency Injection container.\r\n\r\n`TimeProvider` does not truncate to the nearest second, consumers are expected to correctly format the time as needed.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nUnifying the time abstraction across the stack for easier testing.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nComponents that derive from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SecurityStampValidator<TUser>` should remove their `ISystemClock` constructor parameter and call the new base constructor accordingly. Similarly, derived implementations that reference the `Clock` property on these types should reference the new `TimeProvider` property instead. `TimeProvider` is now settable for testing on the options or via DI.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder, ISystemClock clock)\r\n-        : base(options, logger, encoder, clock)\r\n+    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder)\r\n+        : base(options, logger, encoder)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-       var currentUtc = Clock.UtcNow;\r\n+       var currentUtc = TimeProvider.GetUtcNow();\r\n```\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- [`ISystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.isystemclock)\r\n- [`SystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.systemclock)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>.Clock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1.clock)\r\n- [`CookieAuthenticationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationhandler)\r\n- [`FacebookHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.facebook.facebookhandler)\r\n- [`GoogleHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.google.googlehandler)\r\n- [`JwtBearerHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.jwtbearerhandler)\r\n- [`MicrosoftAccountHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.microsoftaccount.microsoftaccounthandler)\r\n- [`NegotiateHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.negotiate.negotiatehandler)\r\n- [`OAuthHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.oauth.oauthhandler-1)\r\n- [`OpenIdConnectHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.openidconnect.openidconnecthandler)\r\n- [`PolicySchemeHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.policyschemehandler)\r\n- [`RemoteAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.remoteauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignInAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signinauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignOutAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signoutauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`TwitterHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.twitter.twitterhandler)\r\n- [`WsFederationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.wsfederation.wsfederationhandler)\r\n- [`SecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.securitystampvalidator-1)\r\n- [`TwoFactorSecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.twofactorsecuritystampvalidator-1)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/505","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider\" (#505)"},{"Id":"1661290568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T20:06:20","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"504","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` no longer use custom converters","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nPrior to .NET 8 Preview 2, `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` type used custom converters to support JSON serialization due to a lack of support for the `IgnoreNullValues` option.

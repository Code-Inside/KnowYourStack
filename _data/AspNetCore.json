Please describe.\r\n\r\nI am trying to make a tabs component, but I don't like using a Cascading Parameter to do it. Feels like a lot of boilerplate.\r\n\r\nHere's one way to do it, *with* Cascading Parameter.\r\n\r\n`TabsComponent.razor`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"tabs\">\r\n    <div class=\"tab-list\">\r\n        <CascadingValue Name=\"tabs\" Value=\"this\">\r\n            @ChildContent\r\n        </CascadingValue>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    @foreach (var tab in Tabs)\r\n    {\r\n        if (tab.Key == SelectedTabId)\r\n        {\r\n            <div class=\"tab-content\">\r\n                @tab.Value.Content\r\n            </div>\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n\r\n    private Dictionary<string, TabComponent> Tabs { get; set; } = new Dictionary<string, TabComponent>();\r\n\r\n    private string? SelectedTabId { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    public RenderFragment? ChildContent { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    internal void AddTab(TabComponent tab)\r\n    {\r\n        if (Tabs.ContainsKey(tab.Id) == true)\r\n        {\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Tabs.Add(tab.Id, tab);\r\n\r\n        StateHasChanged();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    internal void ActivateTab(TabComponent tab)\r\n    {\r\n        SelectedTabId = tab.Id;\r\n\r\n        StateHasChanged();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    internal void RemoveTab(TabComponent tab)\r\n    {\r\n        if (Tabs.ContainsKey(tab.Id) == false)\r\n        {\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Tabs.Remove(tab.Id);\r\n\r\n        StateHasChanged();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`TabComponent.razor`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@implements IDisposable\r\n\r\n@if (TabsComponent != null)\r\n{\r\n    <button @onclick=\"Activate\">\r\n        @Label\r\n    </button>\r\n}\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n\r\n    [CascadingParameter(Name = \"tabs\")]\r\n    public TabsComponent?

SelectedTabId { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [ChildrenParameter]\r\n    public TabComponent[] Children { get; set; } = new TabComponent[0];\r\n\r\n    internal void ActivateTab(TabComponent tab)\r\n    {\r\n        SelectedTabId = tab.Id;\r\n\r\n        StateHasChanged();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`TabComponent.razor`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@code {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    public string Id { get; set; } = $\"tab-{Guid.NewGuid()}\";\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    public RenderFragment? Label { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    public RenderFragment? Content { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAhh. Much nicer, no?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nIt seems like this can work side-by-side with explicitly named render fragments.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, it seems like this can NOT work with the implicit ChildContent render fragment.\r\n\r\nConceivably, you could make a table component, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n(not going to write everything out here, unless requested)\r\n...\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    public TRecord[] Data = new TRecord[0];\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    public ColumnComponent<TRecord>[] Children { get; set; } = new ColumnComponent<TRecord>[0];\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    public RenderFragment<TRecord>? Controls { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing it..\r\n\r\n```\r\n<TableComponent Data=\"@(new object[]{ 1, 2, 3 })\">\r\n    <ColumnComponent>\r\n        <Header>Number</Header>\r\n        <Row Context=\"record\">@record.ToString(\"N\")</Row>\r\n    </ColumnComponent>\r\n    <ColumnComponent>\r\n        <Header>Parity</Header>\r\n        <Row Context=\"record\">@(record % 2 == 0 ? \"Even\" : \"Odd\")</Row>\r\n    </ColumnComponent>\r\n    <Controls Context=\"record\">\r\n        <button @onclick=\"CopyToClipboard(record)\">Copy</button>\r\n    </Controls>\r\n</TableComponent>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutputs..\r\n\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n   <tr>\r\n       <th>Number</th>\r\n       <th>Parity</th>\r\n       <th></th>\r\n   </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n       <td>1</td>\r\n       <td>Odd</td>\r\n       <td><button>Copy</button></td>\r\n   </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n       <td>2</td>\r\n       <td>Even</td>\r\n       <td><button>Copy</button></td>\r\n   </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n       <td>3</td>\r\n       <td>Odd</td>\r\n       <td><button>Copy</button></td>\r\n   </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n```  ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23248","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Children Parameter\" (#23248)"},{"Id":"643345457","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-23T03:21:13","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"23237","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix java pack on local builds","State":"closed","Body":">error MSB3030: Could not copy the file \"build\\libs\\signalr-5.0.0-dev.jar\" because it was not found.\r\n\r\nThe version file will update every major/minor, but those aren't very often so it's fine.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23237","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix java pack on local builds\" (#23237)"},{"Id":"643435923","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-23T00:11:37","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"23247","RawContent":null,"Title":"Validate optional from body parameters","State":"open","Body":"Validation for https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/6878","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23247","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Validate optional from body parameters\" (#23247)"},{"Id":"643431737","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T23:59:02","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"23246","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add support for optional FromBody parameters (#22634)","State":"open","Body":"Cherry-pick https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/22634 to preview7","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23246","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add support for optional FromBody parameters (#22634)\" (#23246)"},{"Id":"643349259","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T23:42:22","Actor":"zubivan","Number":"23239","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix urls of @microsoft/dotnet-js-interop package","State":"closed","Body":"Updates urls in `@microsoft/dotnet-js-interop` package to point to `aspnetcore` repository, seems like it was missed when migrating from https://github.com/dotnet/extensions.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/dotnet-js-interop\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23239","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix urls of @microsoft/dotnet-js-interop package\" (#23239)"},{"Id":"643417406","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T23:16:35","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"23245","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove WebAssemblyHttpHandler ref-assembly package","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/22283\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23245","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Remove WebAssemblyHttpHandler ref-assembly package\" (#23245)"},{"Id":"643411909","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T23:01:20","Actor":"rxelizondo","Number":"23244","RawContent":null,"Title":"Azure app service -

The original issue, #13440, no longer repros in 3.1.x. However some of the later comments on the issue are reporting a different problem that does still repro.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, how do you have a `<select>` and bind it to a property whose value is sometimes null, for example a nullable-enum value?\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately quite a problematic scenario because of a historical quirk in HTML. For any `<option>` that has no `value` attribute, the value is considered to be the *text content* of the option. This is a huge mess because (1) it takes away the only chance we had for representing the idea of a null value (not an empty string), and (2) it leads to completely unpredictable behavior because the text content might or might not happen to match up with a known server-side value depending on the user's current locale.\r\n\r\nSo since we have no way to have a true null-valued `<option>`, the closest we can do is to forget about distinguishing null from empty-string, and ensure that empty-string can round-trip in a binding and is treated as null on the .NET side, at least in the case of a nullable enum.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, our binding code that parses an incoming value as a nullable enum *already* treats `string.Empty` as `null`, so all that remains is accepting a rendered `null` value (represented by the removal/absence of the parent `<select>`'s `value` attribute) as mapping back to the empty-string `<option>`.\r\n\r\nI'm not happy with the fact that we can't really have proper null values, but without either (1) going back to 1995 or (2) piling hacks upon hacks to fight against the browser's default behavior, this is the closest I think we can get.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23221","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix binding <select> to a null value\" (#23221)"},{"Id":"643107668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T16:18:23","Actor":"hoponaillc","Number":"23219","RawContent":null,"Title":"WebRTC + SignalR + Blazor","State":"closed","Body":"Is there a webrtc component available for Blazor?

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This is available starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 \r\n- A set of ciphers compatible with HTTP/2. THis is available starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\nAs such, Kestrel's behavior when HTTP/2 over TLS is configured has been changed to:\r\n- Downgrade to `Http1` and log a message at the `Information` level when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http1AndHttp2`. Note this is the default value for `ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`.\r\n- Throw a `NotSupportedException` when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http2`.\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 are considered as incompatible since they don't have the necessary ciphers by default, it is possible to update the Computer Configuration settings to use HTTP/2 compatible ciphers, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-8-1).

Most of these packages were developed by and are currently maintained by the ASP.NET team. However, moving forward we want to enable more scenarios with these packages, outside of ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nThe packages which we believe are usable in various application models (Configuration, DI, Hosting, etc.) are being moved to the **dotnet/runtime repository**. Packages which are primarily used in ASP.NET Core applications (Web Encoders, etc.) are moving to the **dotnet/aspnetcore repository**. Finally, in order to avoid introducing third-party dependencies into dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore, some packages are remaining in the **dotnet/extensions repository** as they have dependencies on third-party packages (such as integrations with StackExchange.Redis and other components).\r\n\r\nThe full list of packages that are moving can be found at the end of this announcement. In general, tests and samples will be moving to the relevant repo based on where the main package moved. Issue tracking for the relevant packages will also move to that repository.\r\n\r\n## PR/Issue migrations\r\n\r\nThere are 400+ open issues and ~50 open PRs (at time of writing) in dotnet/extensions.\r\n\r\nSince we are actively working on migrating the packages now, we recommend waiting to open new PRs until we update this announcement indicating the migration is complete. Some packages are building in two repositories and we want to make sure your changes land in the right place. Over the migration process, we'll be closing most of the active PRs that target packages which have been moved and asking the author to migrate the PR to the relevant repository.\r\n\r\nFor issues, feel free to continue opening them and we'll respond to them as best we can during the migration. If the package your issue relates to has been moved, we'll handle transferring the issue. We'll be doing some triaging of the incoming issues and the backlog and will attempt to migrate as many issues as possible. As part of this process, we'll also close issues that are no longer relevant, duplicates of other issues, or enhancements we don't plan to support.\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n\r\nIf your question isn't answered here, use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask it!\r\n\r\n#### Are these packages moving in to the Base Class Library (\"BCL\"), or Microsoft.NETCore.App?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to change how these components ship as part of this migration. Packages that currently ship on NuGet.org will continue to do so. Libraries that are currently included in ASP.NET Core will continue to be included. We are not adding any of these components to the BCL at this time.\r\n\r\n#### If package `Microsoft.Extensions.X` is moving to the runtime repo, why not rename it to `System.X`?\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to rename assemblies and redirect type references, it is **not** possible to change package identities, namespaces or type names in a non-breaking way. Renaming these types would be extremely disruptive and provide very little benefit. All of these components are *already* covered by the [.NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) and will continue to be in the future, just like the `System.*` assemblies.\r\n\r\n#### Will these packages still support .NET Standard 2.0?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to reduce the set of frameworks these packages can be used on as part of this migration. If they currently support .NET Standard, we have no plans to change that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why are some packages staying in dotnet/extensions?\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we want to avoid third-party dependencies in the dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore repositories. The packages that depend on third-party dependencies are remaining in dotnet/extensions to help preserve this.\r\n\r\n#### Where should I file issues related to these packages?\r\n\r\nIn general, file issues in the repo that contains the package. Some feature areas are split between multiple repos. If you're not sure, feel free to file issues in any of the three repos (dotnet/runtime, dotnet/extensions or dotnet/aspnetcore) and the team can transfer the issue as needed.\r\n\r\n#### Why did you move package `X` to repo `Y`?\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask questions about specific packages.\r\n\r\n## Package List\r\n\r\nThe following list identifies all the packages we currently ship from [dotnet/extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions) and which repo they are moving

These packages will be maintained by the Azure SDK team at the [Azure/azure-sdk-for-net repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net). Moving these packages over to the Azure SDK team will allow that team to update them as the SDKs themselves are updated, rather than being tied to the .NET Core schedule.\r\n\r\nIf you are using any of the packages listed above, we suggest replacing them with the preview version of the new packages:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.Extensions.Configuration.Secrets`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Extensions.Configuration.Secrets)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault` **becomes** [`Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Keys)\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage` **becomes** [`Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Blobs)\r\n\r\nThese new packages are **supported** on .NET Core 2.1 and 3.1 so you *do not need to wait for 5.0 to update*!

Since ASP.NET Core SignalR users may be using this package, we want to bring this issue to the attention of all ASP.NET Core users.*\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability that affects ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability exists when using the [`MessagePack`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MessagePack/) NuGet package. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how MessagePack handles deserialization.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18716\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-runtime) or your application has a dependency on any of the packages listed in [affected packages](#affected-packages), you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-runtime\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core 2.1, 3.0 or 3.1 application using SignalR with the MessagePack Hub Protocol.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core-based application that uses any of the vulnerable packages shown below, or any ASP.NET Core application running on .NET Core 2.1.x, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMessagePack | 1.0.0 - 1.8.x | 1.9.3 *With code change described below*\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0 - 3.1.1 | *Update transitive reference to `MessagePack`*\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** MessagePack 2.x is *not compatible* with ASP.NET Core SignalR.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nFirst examine the packages you have installed. If you have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` in your package graph, you must update it. If you have a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` in your project, you likely have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` and should fix it by [directly referencing a secure version](#fixing-transitive-dependencies).\r\n\r\n**In addition to updating** you must set the `MessagePackSecurity.Active` static property to enable the `UntrustedData` mode for the MessagePack serializer, to ensure you are protected. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for details. Add the following code to the top of your app's entry point:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n  // Add the following lines\r\n  // Enable additional security in MessagePack to handle untrusted data.\r\n  MessagePackSecurity.Active = MessagePackSecurity.UntrustedData;\r\n\r\n  // Continue with program initialization...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your application provides any custom `IMessagePackFormatter<T>` implementations, you should also update them to include the relevant security measures by ensuring reads of variable-length values (such as strings) are done within a `using (MessagePackSecurity.DepthStep())` block. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for more details.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.8.80\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `MessagePack` version 1.8.80\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `MessagePack` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `MessagePack` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

In ASP.NET Core 5.0, we will move from the 1.x version to the latest 2.x version. This is a breaking change for:\r\n\r\n* Anyone who is setting/configuring values on [`MessagePackHubProtocolOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.messagepackhubprotocoloptions)\r\n* Anyone who was using the MessagePack APIs directly **and** using the ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol in the same application, as the newer version will be loaded instead of the previous version.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously, ASP.NET Core SignalR used the MessagePack 1.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNow, ASP.NET Core SignalR will use the MessagePack 2.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior will impact some aspects of message serialization and deserialization. See the [guidance for migrating from 1.x to 2.x](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md) published by the MessagePack package authors. Specifically, there are [behavioral changes to how DateTime values are serialized](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md#behavioral-changes).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe believe updating to MessagePack v2.x will add useful new functionality and allow us to stay current with the latest improvements in that package.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you are using MessagePack directly in your application **and** using the SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol, update your usage to adapt to any breaking changes in the 2.x release of MessagePack. The MessagePack package authors have published [guidance for migrating from 1.x to 2.x](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md).\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.MessagePackHubProtocolOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.messagepackhubprotocoloptions)\r\n\r\nTo discuss this change, use the following issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18692\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/404","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol moving to MessagePack v2.x package\" (#404)"},{"Id":"549728860","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-14T18:01:38","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"403","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-0603 : ASP.NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-0603 : ASP.NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core software when the software fails to handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. \r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles objects in memory.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18337\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-runtime) or your application has a dependency on any of the packages listed in [affected packages](#affected-packages), you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-runtime\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core 2.1, 3.0 or 3.1 application using SignalR.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core-based application that uses any of the vulnerable packages shown below, or any ASP.NET Core application running on .NET Core 2.1.x, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections | 1.0.0 - 1.0.4 | 1.0.15\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.App  | 2.1.0 - 2.1.14 <br /> 3.0.0 <br /> 3.1.0 | 2.1.15 <br />  3.0.1 <br /> 3.1.1\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.All  | 2.1.0 - 2.1.14 | 2.1.15\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nFirst examine the versions of .NET Core you have installed. You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.802 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixed-runtime-sdks\"></a>Updated runtimes and SDKs\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1, you should download and install Runtime 2.1.5 or SDK 2.1.511 (Visual Studio 2017) or SDK 2.1.608 (Visual Studio 2019) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.0, you should download and install Runtime 3.0.2 or SDK 3.0.102 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.1 or SDK 3.1.101 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple runtimes or SDKs installed, you must update all runtimes or SDKs separately.\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\n#### Applications targeting .NET Core runtime\r\n\r\nUpdate your runtime and SDKs to the versions listed in [Updated runtimes and SDKs](#fixed-runtime-sdks) then restart your application.\r\n\r\n#### Applications targeting .NET Framework\r\n\r\nFirst update your .NET Core runtimes and SDKs to the versions listed in [Updated runtimes and SDKs](#fixed-runtime-sdks). As targeting .NET Framework adds dependencies for various packages you must update the dependencies your application uses, recompile and redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory.

The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18336\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version that is listed in [affected software](#affected-runtime) or your application has a dependency on any of the packages listed in [affected packages](#affected-packages), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-runtime\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core 2.1, 3.0 or 3.1 application using SignalR.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core-based application that uses any of the vulnerable packages that are shown below, or any ASP.NET Core application running on .NET Core 2.1.x, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections | 1.0.0 - 1.0.4 | 1.0.15\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.App  | 2.1.0 - 2.1.14 <br /> 3.0.0 <br /> 3.1.0 | 2.1.15 <br /> 3.0.1 <br /> 3.1.1\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.All  | 2.1.0 - 2.1.14 | 2.1.15\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nFirst examine the versions of .NET Core you have installed. You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.802 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"fixed-runtime-sdks\"></a>Updated runtimes and SDKs\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1, you should download and install Runtime 2.1.511 or SDK 2.1.511 (Visual Studio 2017) or SDK 2.1.608 (Visual Studio 2019) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.0, you should download and install Runtime 3.0.2 or SDK 3.0.102 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.1 or SDK 3.1.101 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple runtimes or SDKs installed, you must update all runtimes or SDKs separately.\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\n#### Applications targeting .NET Core runtime\r\n\r\nUpdate your runtime and SDKs to the versions listed in [Updated runtimes and SDKs](#fixed-runtime-sdks) then restart your application.\r\n\r\n#### Applications targeting .NET Framework\r\n\r\nFirst update your .NET Core runtimes and SDKs to the versions listed in [Updated runtimes and SDKs](#fixed-runtime-sdks). As targeting .NET Framework adds dependencies for various packages, you must update the dependencies your application uses, recompile, and redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means one of the following:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages.\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The `FrameworkReference` includes all the libraries that make up ASP.NET Core. See https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/325 for the motivation and reason behind this change. For all libraries that are referenced in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` framework, we ignore references in your project of a lower version. For example, if a 2.2 version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel` (one of the libraries in the framework) is also separately referenced by the application, we ignore the 2.2 version when building. These update rules are defined by the `PlatformManifest.txt` file is part of the SDK. Any library in that list has this behavior, earlier references to those libraries are ignored. \r\n\r\nHowever, in 3.0.1 and 3.1.0, we introduced a regression which removed a few select references from the `PlatformManifest.txt` file by mistake.\r\n\r\nLibraries that were _removed_ from the `PlatformManifest.txt` between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1:\r\n\r\n* aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll (previously part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS package)\r\n* System.Drawing.Common.dll\r\n* Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.dll\r\n* System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.dll\r\n\r\nLibraries that were _added_ to the PlatformManifest.txt between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.Win32.Registry.dll\r\n* System.Security.AccessControl.dll\r\n* System.Security.Cryptography.Cng.dll\r\n* System.Security.Principal.Windows.dll\r\n\r\nThe libraries that were added to the `PlatformManifest.txt` shouldn't adversely affect applications. However, the dependencies _removed_ do affect applications. In particular, the `aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll` native library is critical to IIS in-process hosting. Issues with this have been reported in a few places (for example https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17662). We've now identified this is a broader regression.\r\n\r\nIf an application references (directly or transitively) a previous version of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS`, `System.Drawing.Common`, `Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents`, or `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs` package, it might deploy the older dependency rather than the 3.0/3.1 dependency. This can cause assembly load failures.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nUsers may work around this issue by doing one of the following:\r\n\r\n### Remove all direct and indirect references to the affected packages.\r\n\r\nThe following packages include the `aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll` native library:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS\r\n\r\nOther affected libraries are contained in packages with the same name. See the above lists.\r\n\r\nThe resolution is to remove these package references from your application. Be aware that they may be transitive dependencies (dependencies of other packages you depend upon).\r\n\r\n### Avoid publishing incorrect package content\r\n\r\nIf you cannot remove earlier versions of the pacakges, you can explicitly suppress those packages from publishing using `ExcludeAssets`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n     <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS\" Version=\"2.2.6\" ExcludeAssets=\"All\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe recommend clearing out bin/obj folders before building with the above fix.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/398","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SDK regression in 3.0.101 and 3.1.100 for ASP.NET Core workloads\" (#398)"},{"Id":"528976515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T21:16:55","Actor":"rynowak","Number":"396","RawContent":null,"Title":"HttpClient instances created by IHttpClientFactory will now log HTTP status codes as integers instead of with status code names","State":"open","Body":"## HttpClient logging\r\n\r\nHttpClient instances created by IHttpClientFactory will now log HTTP status codes as integers instead of with status code names.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nLogging would use the textual descriptions of HTTP status codes:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nReceived HTTP response after 56.0044ms - OK\r\nEnd processing HTTP request after 70.0862ms - OK\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nLogging will use the integer values of HTTP status codes:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nReceived HTTP response after 56.0044ms - 200\r\nEnd processing HTTP request after 70.0862ms - 200\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe original behavior of this logging is inconsistent with other parts of ASP.NET Core that have always used integer values. This inconsistency makes logs hard to query via structured logging systems such as ElasticSearch. See aspnet/Extensions#1549\r\n\r\nUsing integer values is ultimately more flexible than text because it allows queries on ranges of values. \r\n\r\nWe considered adding an additional log value to capture the integer status code, but that would introduce another inconsistency with the rest of ASP.NET Core. HttpClient logging and HTTP server/hosting logging use the same key name (`StatusCode`) already.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe best option is update logging queries to use the integer values of status codes. While this may cause some difficulty writing queries across multiple ASP.NET Core versions right now, we believe that using integers for this purpose is much more flexible for querying logs. \r\n\r\nIf for some reason you need to force compatibility with the old behavior, and use textual status codes, you can do this by replacing `IHttpClientFactory`'s logging with your own.\r\n\r\n1.

It's still very early in the process, but we're checking in some initial experiments and want to make our current plans clear. This is a long-lead effort that will take time, but we want to get this work in public as soon as possible so our community can be involved.\r\n\r\n## Initial Experiments\r\n\r\nOver the next few weeks, we will be starting to merge in some early experiments in supporting HTTP/3. We'll also continue to improve these experiments as we explore HTTP/3 and QUIC and learn how best to integrate it into our stack.\r\n\r\nThe prototype uses \"msquic\", a cross-platform QUIC implementation developed at Microsoft. This library is *not available for public consumption* at this time, so external contributors cannot run our experimental HTTP/3 work. This **only affects contributors who are specifically working in our prototype HTTP/3 components**, other contributors will not be affected (all the necessary builds, samples, tests, etc. will be disabled by default). Unless you are trying to make changes to the HTTP/3 components, you should not be affected by this change.\r\n\r\nThis is a *temporary* situation and we will keep you posted via this announcements repo.\r\n\r\n## Timelines\r\n\r\nWe aren't making any commitments on a timeline for HTTP/3 support. Right now, these are experiments as we learn what we need to do to deliver HTTP/3 support.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/15271 for more details on the upcoming work.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/393","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"For contributors: Experimenting on QUIC and HTTP/3 in ASP.NET Core\" (#393)"},{"Id":"510251999","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-21T20:00:44","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"392","RawContent":null,"Title":"HTTPS redirection changes for IIS OutOfProcess in 2.2 and 3.0 ","State":"open","Body":"## HTTPS redirection changes for IIS OutOfProcess in 2.2 and 3.0 \r\n\r\nThe new AspNetCoreModule for hosting via IIS OutOfProcess lights up an existing HTTPS redirection feature for both 3.0 and 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nFor discussion see https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/15243.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 3.0\r\nAspNetCoreModule 13.0.19218.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe 2.1 project template first introduced support for HTTPS tools like UseHttpsRedirection and UseHsts. Https redirection required configuration to enable since apps in development do not use the default port 443. Hsts is only active if the request is already HTTPS, and skips localhost by default.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nIn 3.0 the IIS HTTPS scenario was [enhanced](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/4685) so that the application could discover the server HTTPS ports and make UseHttpsRedirection work by default. InProcess did this via the IServerAddresses feature, which only affects 3.0 applications because the InProcess library is versioned with the framework. OutOfProcess changed to automatically add the ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT environment variable which affected both 2.2 and 3.0 applications because the OutOfProcess component is shared globally. 2.1 apps are not affected because they use a prior version of AspNetCoreModule by default.\r\n\r\nThe 3.0 version of AspNetCoreModule was recently deployed to Azure Web Sites and some users noticed the that this did affect their 2.2 applications as described above.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nImproved 3.0 functionality.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you want all clients to use HTTPS then no action is required. If you want to allow some clients to use HTTP then take one of the following steps:\r\n\r\nA) Remove UseHttpsRedirection and UseHsts from your application's Startup.cs file and redeploy the application.\r\n\r\nOr B) Add the environment variable ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT with an empty value to your web.config file. This can be done directly on the server without redeploying the application.\r\n```\r\n      <aspNetCore processPath=\"dotnet\" arguments=\".\\WebApplication3.dll\" stdoutLogEnabled=\"false\" stdoutLogFile=\"\\\\?\\%home%\\LogFiles\\stdout\" >\r\n          <environmentVariables>\r\n            <environmentVariable name=\"ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT\" value=\"\" />\r\n          </environmentVariables>\r\n      </aspNetCore>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseHttpsRedirection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.httpspolicybuilderextensions.usehttpsredirection?view=aspnetcore-3.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/392","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HTTPS redirection changes for IIS OutOfProcess in 2.2 and 3.0 \" (#392)"},{"Id":"508662905","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T19:01:30","Actor":"syndicatedshannon","Number":"391","RawContent":null,"Title":"IAllowAnonymous no longer appears in AuthorizationFilterContext.Filters collection","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis issue template is for use in opening issues that document breaking changes.

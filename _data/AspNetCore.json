The RFCs allow this combination, but you must consume the request body before the upgrade can be completed. See https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/17081#issuecomment-726300552 for details.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n- Many recommended NGinx configurations always add the Connection: Upgrade header just in case it's needed. This causes Kestrel to refuse any request from NGinx that also has a body.\r\n- It's also possible to use Upgrade to negotiate an optional HTTP/2 upgrade, though ALPN is usually preferred. Clients that do support this will add the headers only to have request with bodies refused by Kestrel.\r\n\r\nProposal: Ignore the `Connection: Upgrade` header if the request has a body, process the requests as normal. This makes Kestrel more compatible without doing the more complex work to fully support upgrade requests that do have bodies.\r\n\r\nIf we're happy with this fix then I also propose backporting it to 3.1 and 5.0, we've had a lot of feedback about it.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/27921","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Allow/ignore upgrades with bodies \" (#27921)"},{"Id":"745129483","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-17T22:19:27","Actor":"Rick-Anderson","Number":"27920","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update README.md","State":"closed","Body":"Your version was fine.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/27920","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update README.md\" (#27920)"},{"Id":"745110491","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-17T21:45:10","Actor":"JunTaoLuo","Number":"27919","RawContent":null,"Title":"Moving more extensions packages into aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"Addresses https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore-internal/issues/3707.\r\n\r\nWe are migrating \r\n- Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.SqlServer\r\n- Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis\r\n- Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly\r\ninto aspnetcore from 6.0 and onwards.

Index.razor. Where we have “GrandchildMessage” property given as two-way binding. \r\n ```\r\n<ParentComponent @ref=\"parentComponent\"> \r\n    <ChildComponent ChildMessage=\"@childMessage\"> \r\n        <GrandChildComponent @bind-GrandchildMessage=\"@grandChildMessage\"></GrandChildComponent> \r\n    </ChildComponent> \r\n</ParentComponent> \r\n ```\r\n3.\tWe have a scenario to serialize and deserialize the component properties. So we used a System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer to serialize/deserialize the component.   \r\n \r\n4.\tHere, we have tried to change Grandchild component value within a razor file of serialized value to update into the current property value and handling it as two-way bind.   \r\n\r\n[ParentComponent.razor]  \r\n```\r\n    public async Task Load() \r\n    { \r\n        ChildComponent child = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ChildComponent>(data); \r\n       \r\n         //Below code is used to update the child component parameter on the child component, and it is not working.         \r\n       //Child = await Child.PropertyUpdate(child);   \r\n       \r\n       //Below code is used to update the child component parameter on the parent component, and it is working. \r\n        Child.GrandChildComponent.GrandchildMessage = await child.GrandChildComponent.UpdateProperty(child.GrandChildComponent.GrandchildMessage, Child.GrandChildComponent.GrandchildMessage, Child.GrandChildComponent.GrandchildMessageChanged); \r\n    } \r\n```\r\n [ChildComponent.razor] \r\n```\r\ninternal async Task<ChildComponent> PropertyUpdate(ChildComponent child) \r\n{  \r\n    GrandChildComponent = await GrandChildComponent.PropertyUpdate(child.GrandChildComponent); \r\n    return this; \r\n} \r\n ```\r\n \r\n[GrandChildComponent.razor] \r\n```\r\ninternal async Task<GrandChildComponent> PropertyUpdate(GrandChildComponent grand) \r\n{ \r\n        GrandchildMessage = grandchildMessage = await UpdateProperty(grand.GrandchildMessage, GrandchildMessage, GrandchildMessageChanged); \r\n        return this; \r\n } \r\ninternal async Task<T> UpdateProperty<T>(T publicValue, T privateValue, EventCallback<T> eventCallback) \r\n{ \r\n        var finalValue = publicValue; \r\n        if (!EqualityComparer<T>.Default.Equals(publicValue, privateValue)) \r\n        { \r\n            await eventCallback.InvokeAsync(finalValue); \r\n        } \r\n        return finalValue; \r\n } \r\n ```\r\n5.\tSo In the Parent Component, we tried to update the “GrandchildMessage” parameter of the GrandChildComponent through calling `PropertyUpdate` method of `GrandChildComponent`. The desterilized value set to the GrandchildMessage parameter. but it reset to previous value immediately.   \r\n \r\n6.\tBut If we update the de-serialized Parameter of GrandChildComponent component value from root component ie. ParentComponent then it will be working fine instead of updating the same value within a grandchild component class.

These two features are optional parameters `{parameter?}` and catch all parameters `{*catchall}`.\r\n\r\nOur routing system ordered the routes based on precedence and the (now false) assumption that route templates would only match paths with an equal number of segments.\r\n\r\nThe implementation that we have worked for naïve scenarios but breaks on more real world scenarios.

The macOS builds failed with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4319710Z undef: _SecCertificateCreateWithData\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4320190Z undef: _CFDataCreateWithBytesNoCopy\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4320420Z undef: _kCFAllocatorDefault\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4321260Z undef: _kCFAllocatorNull\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4321510Z undef: _CFStringCreateWithCStringNoCopy\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4321760Z undef: _CFRelease\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4322020Z undef: _SecTrustCreateWithCertificates\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4322260Z undef: _CFArrayCreate\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4322470Z undef: _SecPolicyCreateSSL\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4322670Z undef: _SecTrustEvaluate\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4322920Z Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4324010Z   \"_SecCertificateCreateWithData\", referenced from:\r\n2020-11-03T01:49:39.4327280Z       web::http::client::details::verify_cert_chain_platform_specific(boost::asio::ssl::verify_context&, std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&) in libcpprest.a(x509_cert_utilities.cpp.o)\r\n<list of 9 other symbols not found in libcpprest omitted for clarity>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRealizing that maybe our makefiles were omitting something crucial (i.e. we didn't read the signalr cmake files correctly for settings), we scoured the library's instructions and its cmake files to see if maybe we omitted something. We could not determine that what might be different between linux and macOS compilations. \r\n\r\nTo simplify the repro, we decided to create a simple app that leveraged cmake. We confirmed that our test app was able to use the signalr-c++ library with no problem on linux machines; however, on macOS, nearly similar build failures were received. \r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-11-04T02:02:04.4632820Z Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:\r\n2020-11-04T02:02:04.4633430Z   \"_CFArrayCreate\", referenced from:\r\n2020-11-04T02:02:04.4660730Z       web::http::client::details::verify_X509_cert_chain(std::__1::vector<std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> >, std::__1::allocator<std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > > > const&, std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&) in libcpprest.a(x509_cert_utilities.cpp.o)\r\n<list of 9 other symbols not found in libcpprest omitted for clarity>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expectation\r\nSince both the Linux and MacOS pipelines use the exact same instruction and all we're changing is the vmImage value, the build process should work on both operating systems.\r\n\r\nI knew rolling our own makefile might be problematic but I did not expect builds on macOS with the provided cmake instructions to fail. We have successfully built on linux but cannot get the same code to compile on the mac. We've scrubbed the instructions on the project's repo and double checked everything a few times over. Is this a problem with signalr-client-c++ cmake files or vcpkg's package implementation of the signalr library?  Any guidance would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- signalr-client-c++ library, tag = v0.1.0-alpha-1\r\n- vcpkg, tag = 2020.06\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27899","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to build  signalr-client-c++ app on macOS\" (#27899)"},{"Id":"744352323","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-17T05:03:12","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"27898","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/5.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:5a5466f0-17ae-442c-2f05-08d85e5f2673)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/efcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 5a5466f0-17ae-442c-2f05-08d85e5f2673\r\n- **Build**: 20201116.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: 11/17/2020 1:44 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 593d967ef28e55cd411236d5ebeb75bfb74bdc65\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/5.0\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**: [from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1][1]\r\n  - **dotnet-ef**: [from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore**: [from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design**: [from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory**: [from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational**: [from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite**: [from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer**: [from 5.0.1 to 5.0.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/compare/d05f81d...593d967\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:5a5466f0-17ae-442c-2f05-08d85e5f2673)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/27898","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/5.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore\" (#27898)"},{"Id":"745173487","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-15T21:05:49","Actor":"gojanpaolo","Number":"27923","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consider C# 9 top-level statements for Design-time DbContext Creation","State":"open","Body":"I migrated to .NET 5 and tried to use top-level statement for my `Program` class.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

All breaking changes to nullability annotations will be aggregated into this issue throughout the course of .NET 6.0.**_\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0, we have been applying nullability annotations to parts of ASP.NET Core. From the outset of this effort, [we anticipated that mistakes would be made](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/api-guidelines/nullability.md#breaking-change-guidance) in these annotations and fixes would need to be made. In .NET 6.0, we are updating some annotations that have been previously applied. Some of these changes are considered source breaking changes because it leads to the APIs being incompatible or more restrictive, or could result in build-time warnings when used in projects that have nullable reference types enabled.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27564 for further discussions.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe affected APIs had incorrect nullable reference type annotations and build warnings were either absent or incorrect.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNew build warnings will be produced and incorrect build warnings will no longer be produced for the affected APIs.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThrough feedback and further testing, the nullable annotations for the affected APIs were determined to be inaccurate.

For example, if a razor class library defined a static web asset to be served under `/folder/file.txt` and the host placed a file under `wwwroot/folder/file.txt` the file on the server would silently override the file on the Razor Class Library or Blazor Webassembly application.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core will now correctly detect when this issue happens and inform of the conflict so that users can be aware and take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis was a bug in the implementation, we never intended for static web assets to be \"overridable\" by files on the wwwroot host of the project since that leads to errors that are hard to diagnose and can result in undefined behavior changes when applications are published.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason for a file on a Razor Class Library to conflict with a file on the host by default since they are prefixed with `_content/${PackageId}` unless we are discussing Blazor Webassembly applications, which get placed by default at the root of the host url space, which makes conflicts easier. (For example, Blazor Webassembly Applications contain a favicon.ico that the host might also include in their wwwroot folder).\r\n\r\nIf the source of the conflict is a file in a Razor Class Library it normally means there is some code that copies the assets from the library into the wwwroot folder of the project. We don't recommend developers doing that since it defeats one of the main goals of static web assets which is that files don't have to be copied around, which is fundamental to get updates on the browser when the contents are updated without having to trigger a new compilation.\r\n\r\nIf despite that you want to preserve this behavior and maintain the file on the host, you can do so by removing the file from the list of static web assets with a custom MSBuild target.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the file on the razor class library or the blazor webassembly file instead of the file from the host project, just remove the file from the host project.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updated validation logic for Static Web Assets\" (#443)"},{"Id":"724794249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T19:05:24","Actor":"tatti9018","Number":"442","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"Help with feature “Control Startup class activation”\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n            .ConfigureWebHost(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.UseStartup(context => new Startup(logger));\r\n            })\r\n            .Build();\r\n```\r\nWhen I use Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly”, I get error: ‘IHostBuilder’ does not contain a definition for ‘ConfigureWebHostDefaults’\r\nWhen I set Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, project see ConfigureWebHostDefaults, but project doesn’t work….","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/442","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work\" (#442)"},{"Id":"712253766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-30T20:21:51","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5","State":"open","Body":"## Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5\r\n\r\n.NET 5 introduces a variety of [new Blazor features](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514), some of which are not compatible with certain older browsers.

Starting from ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1, all of those readonly public fields have changed to readonly public properties.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect this change to affect many developers because:\r\n\r\n * Any application or library that simply uses `.razor` files (or even manual `RenderTreeBuilder` calls) to define its components would not be referencing this type directly\r\n * The `RenderTreeFrame` type itself is regarded as an implementation detail, not intended for use outside the framework. ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later includes an analyzer that issues compiler warnings if the type is being used directly.\r\n * Even if you do reference `RenderTreeFrame` directly, this change is binary-breaking but not source-breaking. That is, your existing source code will still compile and behave properly. You will only encounter an issue if compiling against the 3.x framework and then running those binaries against the 5.0 RC1 and later framework.\r\n\r\n## Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1\r\n\r\n## Old behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` were defined as fields, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\n## New behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` are defined as properties with the same names as before, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\nIf older precompiled code has not been recompiled since this change, it may throw an exception similar to *MissingFieldException: Field not found: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame.FrameType'*.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary in order to implement some high-impact performance improvements in Blazor component rendering on ASP.NET Core 5.0 while retaining the same level of safety and encapsulation as before.\r\n\r\n## Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Blazor developers will not be affected and do not need to take action. This is most likely to affect library/package authors, but still only rarely. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* If you are developing an application, and either staying on ASP.NET Core 3.x or upgrading to 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to make any changes to your own code.\r\n   * However if you depend on a library that needs to upgrade to account for this change, then you would need to update to a newer version of that library.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support only ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to take any action. Just ensure that your `csproj` declares the `TargetFramework` value `net5.0`.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support both ASP.NET Core 3.x *and* 5.0, then check whether or not your code attempts to read any of the members of `RenderTreeFrame` (for example, evaluating `someRenderTreeFrame.FrameType`).\r\n    * Most libraries will not do that. This includes libraries that contain `.razor` components. In this case you don't need to take any action.\r\n    * However, if your library does do that, then you will need to use multitargeting to support both `netstandard2.1` and `net5.0`. First, in your `csproj`, replace the existing `<TargetFramework>` with `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`. Then instead of referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` with a fixed version number such as 3.0.0, use a conditional reference to account for both versions you wish to support. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"3.0.0\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"5.0.0-rc.1.*\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' != 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further clarification, see this [diff showing how @jsakamoto already upgraded his `Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement` library in this way](https://github.com/jsakamoto/Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement/commit/090df430ba725f9420d412753db8104e8c32bf51).\r\n\r\n## Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fields on RenderTreeFrame have become properties\" (#438)"},{"Id":"696062913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T17:46:46","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

For example:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar jsObjectReference = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync<JSObjectReference>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n`JSObjectReference` will be made `internal`, so the new `IJSObjectReference` type must be used instead:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar jsObjectReference = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also applies for `JSInProcessObjectReference`, which was replaced by `IJSInProcessObjectReference`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe change makes this feature more consistent with other patterns within Blazor. `IJSObjectReference` is analogous to `IJSRuntime` in that it serves a similar purpose and has similar methods and extensions.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nReplace all occurrences of `JSObjectReference` and `JSInProcessObjectReference` with `IJSObjectReference` and `IJSInProcessObjectReference` in your code.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.JSInterop.JSObjectReference`\r\n`Microsoft.JSInterop.JSInProcessObjectReference`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf no APIs are affected, this should read:\r\n     \"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n  If affected APIs are identifiable, include a link for each.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the default behavior of `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBy default, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found (i.e. the exception handler returns a 404) when the middleware executes. To allow 404 responses to be returned by the exception handler, please configure the option `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. When this option is set to true, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run. The exception thrown will be handled by the server. For example, the exception will be converted to a 500 error response by Kestrel HTTP server or HTTP.SYS server. \r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility using the current behavior, where a 404 response from the exception handler is allowed, please set `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`.

So, starting with .NET 5 preview 7, the `.razor` compiler will omit insignificant whitespace by default.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, this will not have any effect on the visual layout of the rendered component, since the whitespace nodes being removed would not normally affect it. However, the whitespace might affect the rendered output if you are using a CSS rule like `white-space: pre`. If you need to preserve the whitespace, you can use the new directive `@preservewhitespace true` at the top of your `.razor` file, or inside an `_Imports.razor` file to apply the preference to an entire subdirectory or even your whole project.\r\n\r\nFor further discussions, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23568\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following `.razor` code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n    @foreach (var item in Items)\r\n    {\r\n        <li>\r\n            @item.Text\r\n        </li>\r\n    }\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would previously have rendered two whitespace nodes outside the `@foreach`, and then two more around the `<li>`, and then two more around `@item.Text`. If the list contained 100 items, this would have been 402 whitespace nodes - i.e., more than half of all nodes rendered, even though none of them would visually affect the rendered output. Eliminating them at compile time greatly improves performance for rendering and diffing.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes were preserved\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes are removed if:\r\n\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within an element\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within a `RenderFragment` parameter (e.g., child content being passed to another component)\r\n * ... they precede or follow a C# code block such as an `@if`, `@foreach`, etc.\r\n\r\n... except if the `@preservewhitespace` directive is used with value `true`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nPerformance.

This is available starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 \r\n- A set of ciphers compatible with HTTP/2. THis is available starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\nAs such, Kestrel's behavior when HTTP/2 over TLS is configured has been changed to:\r\n- Downgrade to `Http1` and log a message at the `Information` level when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http1AndHttp2`. Note this is the default value for `ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`.\r\n- Throw a `NotSupportedException` when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http2`.\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 are considered as incompatible since they don't have the necessary ciphers by default, it is possible to update the Computer Configuration settings to use HTTP/2 compatible ciphers, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-8-1).

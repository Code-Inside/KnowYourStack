The discussion surrounding its inclusion is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/42195#discussion_r901049629). The main impact of this change is that filters run on all endpoints, not just minimal route handlers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if an endpoint is not a minimal route handler, the method being filtered is just a `RequestDelegate` even if that `RequestDelegate` ultimately called an MVC action or SignalR Hub method with a different method signature.\r\n\r\nIf we only stopped calling `RDF.Create()` in `REB.Build()` and made no other changes, this would mean filters would go back to only working with minimal route handlers despite now being applicable to any `IEndpointConventionBuilder`. We could conceivably come up with analyzers that give errors when applied to `IEndpointConventionBuilder`s we know won't work, but that still doesn't help that filters applied to groups would only run for minimal route handlers and no other endpoints.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in addition to removing `RDF.Create()` from `REB.Build()`, we're planning to add better support for what are now \"EndpointFilters\" instead of \"RouteHandlerFilters\" in MVC with #42557. With this PR, the actual MVC action ends the filter pipeline instead of a `RequestDelegate` that indirectly invokes the action.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we should update our internal `ModelEndpointDataSource` to run filters on the `RequestDelegate`s passed to `MapGet` and its associated methods. It make sense to use `RequestDelegate` as the final method in the filter pipeline in this case, because that's what the developer defined the endpoint with.\r\n\r\nSome things like `MapHub` just call the `RequestDelegate` `Map` method overloads. For things like SignalR Hubs that might have another plausible way of filtering the endpoint other than just by filtering the `RequestDelegate` it defines, we should probably start using a custom internal `EndpointDataSource` that does not run filters on the `RequestDelegate`s.\r\n\r\nBased on early discussions, we don't think we'll be running these filters for Razor Pages or SignalR Hub invocations in .NET 7. If we decide to run filters on more things in .NET 8, we'll need to figure out how to do it in a way that is sufficiently non-breaking way, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Any change to filter behavior without an opt-in switch is potentially breaking.\r\n\r\nIn general, the change here is to make the `EndpointDataSource` implementations solely responsible for running filters. This means that anyone using a custom `EndpointDataSource` won't have filters run automatically when building their `RouteEndpoint`s, but at least they can run them manually. I think custom `EndpointDataSource` implementations are relatively rare in any case.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42703","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Remove RequestDelegateFactory call from RouteEndpointBuilder\" (#42703)"},{"Id":"1301523353","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-13T00:08:43","Actor":"dougbu","Number":"42682","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 7.0.0-rc1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/42682","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 7.0.0-rc1\" (#42682)"},{"Id":"1301414732","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T23:49:27","Actor":"justindbaur","Number":"42677","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `CreateHandler` method that allows additonal configuration","State":"closed","Body":"# Add `CreateHandler` method that allows additonal configuration\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a pull request to our repo. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If this is your first PR in the ASP.NET Core repo, please run through the checklist\r\nbelow to ensure a smooth review and merge process for your PR. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] You've read the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [x] You've included unit or integration tests for your change, where applicable.\r\n- [x] You've included inline docs for your change, where applicable.\r\n- [x] There's an open issue for the PR that you are making.

But it doesn't quite have all the customization as you might need to configure the `HttpContext` before it gets sent through your application. This change makes it so that a developer can create a handler that allows you one last chance to customize a call to your application so for example you can set `Connection` information. \r\n\r\nFixes #42567\r\n\r\n## Implementation Notes\r\nI made the additional argument to the `ClientHandler` constructor an optional one that will connect to a method that does nothing if it isn't provided. This is a bit different from the api I proposed in the linked issue but it made for fewer changes in the tests. I could also just have it be supplied through a property. I am more than willing to change it to however others prefer.  \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/42677","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add `CreateHandler` method that

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new feature request as-per-say, I am looking for a **suggestion/feedback** on the following topic. I am sorry if I opened this discussion in the wrong place, but I am afraid I could not find a generic discussions tab.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nI am migrating controllers from ASP.NET WebAPI app to ASP.NET Core WebApi app in a legacy application. I have been looking into a few strategies (big-bang migration, strangler fig, patterns described by aspnet team in whitepapers and [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/webapi?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio). I have numerous controllers, all separated into different library projects, that are referenced by the ASP.NET host today.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\nThe idea on which I would like to get feedback: Until a new ASP.NET Core host is being \"built and tested\", I would like to use the controllers in both hosts (the old ASP.NET application and the new ASP.NET Core). I would like to avoid duplicating most of the controllers. Instead, I plan to create abstractions that have different implementations on ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core, and migrate my controllers onto these abstractions. These abstractions would be different types, however named the same way and only one of them would be compiled at a time (I either compile the .NET6 ASP.NET Core app or .NET462 ASP.NET app).\r\n\r\n For example, I could introduce `MyHttpGetAttribute` type and migrate all controller actions using from `[HttpGet]` attribute to `[MyHttpGet]`.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of `MyHttpGetAttribute` would be similar to this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n#if NET6_0\r\npublic class MyHttpGetAttribute : Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.HttpGetAttribute \r\n{\r\n}\r\n#endif\r\n#if NET462\r\n[AttributeUsageAttribute(AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false, \r\n    Inherited = true)]\r\npublic class MyHttpGetAttribute : Attribute, IActionHttpMethodProvider\r\n{\r\n   // ctors\r\n}\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, that [System.Web.HttpGetAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aspnet/hh834620(v=vs.118)) is sealed, hence `MyHttpGetAttribute` cannot derive from it.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to create an abstractions for a few of these types (RouteAttributes, HttpGet/Put/Post attribute, ProducesAttribute) as well as a new `MyBaseController` type which either derives from `ApiController` or `ControllerBase` corresponding to the framework (also using C# preprocessor directives for separation). `MyBaseController` would then have methods like\r\n\r\n`protected new MyOkResult Ok() => new MyOkResult();` (where `MyOkResult` just derives from [System.Web.Http.Results.OkResult ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aspnet/dn292657(v=vs.118)) or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.OkResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0) respectively to the preprocessor directive) Notice, this is not overriding the base class `Ok` method, but hiding it with `new` operator.\r\n\r\nI estimate, most (say 90%) of my controller actions can be migrated to my new abstractions. The more complex actions - where abstraction would not be possible or implementations differ greatly - I plan to have an ASP.NET Core and an ASP.NET version of the same action side-by-side separated with preprocessor directives.\r\n\r\nFilters, DelegatingHandlers, Middlewares, Authentication, application configuration etc. needs to be built up in the new ASP.NET Core host - I am not planning to abstract any of those. The new host will have these aspects of the application 'migrated' and the two hosts will live side-by-side.\r\n\r\nThis is temporary state until the old ASP.NET host can be completely decommissioned. Based on a POC and initial testing, this proposal works, but it still requires a more rigorous testing on my side as well.\r\n\r\n**Question to ASP.NET team**: Do you see any issues or concerns with this approach?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42696","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Migration strategy with abstraction from ASP.NET webapi to ASP.NET Core\" (#42696)"},{"Id":"1302452879","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T18:13:07","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"42695","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/42695","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#42695)"},{"Id":"1302415091","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-12T17:33:05","Actor":"bertramdryan","Number":"42693","RawContent":null,"Title":"IJSRuntime in documentation","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

This initially worked as expected.\r\n\r\nAfter iterating on the code a bit (including adding an RCL), while it still runs locally, trying to debug via Docker fails with the exception below during the initial app startup (at the `WebApplication.CreateBuilder` line).\r\n\r\nMost of the call stack of the bug is optimised away so I can't glean much of interest, but of note is that inside the `ManifestStaticWebAssetFileProvider` constructor, the `manifest.ContentRoots` collection contains a mixture of Linux and Windows absolute paths (notably, using the Windows path for the RCL paths).  So I suspect it's breaking on the Windows paths.  (But as these are paths on the dev machine, I don't see why they exist at runtime at all...)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nEither a build error (that hints at the correct fix, assuming there is one) or running successfully.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Blazor Server project with Linux docker support enabled\r\n2. Create a new RCL project in the same solution but *not* inside the solution's directory\r\n3. Reference the library from the app and use a component somewhere.\r\n4. Run in regular mode; observe no problems.\r\n5. Run in docker mode; observe no build errors, but the exception below occurs.\r\n\r\nIt appears to work as expected when all of the referenced projects are either packages or are within the same solution directory, and falls over whenever referencing something \"outside\".\r\n\r\nI wondered if perhaps this needed some additional copying in the `Dockerfile`, except that the actual docker build does seem to work, even though it only appears to copy the app project file prior to the restore.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.ArgumentException\r\n  HResult=0x80070057\r\n  Message=The path must be absolute.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object.

There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

Eg.:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-0f87920dc675fdfdf8d7638d3be66577-bd6bdbf32d21b714-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"\": [\r\n+      \"A non-empty request body is required.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"value\": [\r\n      \"The value field is required.\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is an alignment with other parts of the framework that were already using the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody) and also a fix to a reported issue dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29570\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nNo change is required, however, if you getting an unexpected behavior is recommended to review if your client's requests are sending the appropriated headers/information.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC Action Controllers","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/484","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding\" (#484)"},{"Id":"1154726545","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T01:08:45","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"483","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Event IDs for some Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core log messages changed","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs part of updating the Microsoft.AspNetcore.Mvc.Core assembly to use `LoggerMessageAttribute`, we discovered logger event Ids being reused within a single log category.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

This is primarily used to support runtime-compilation based scenarios.\r\n\r\nPrior to .NET 6, `PreserveCompilationContext` was configured to `true` for all apps that target the Razor (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor`) and Web (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`) apps.

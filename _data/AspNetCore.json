The issue is associated with one of two possible changes to the application.  \n1. Possibility is that the .Net Visual studio bootstrapping for a Razor CRUD component using Entity Framework breaks the /Account pages, OR\n2. Blowing away the data migrations and then regenerating them using add-migration Initial followed by update-database on a new SQLite database breaks things.  This issue also happens when running against Postgresql databases but the example repro uses Sqlite\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMaking changes such as updating migrations and adding CRUD Razor components to the application via Visual Studio 2022 do not cause the /Account pages to stop rendering.  They should continue to operate or at least throw an actionable error to help the developer identify a path to fixing the issue.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nVisit https://github.com/RightFootConsulting/InteractiveBreaksAccount\nTo download a reproduction of the issue.\n\nThe steps for reproduction are documented in the example app which is linked to by this issue on Github. but a summary is as follows:\n\n1. Create a new Blazor Server app.\n2. Define a data model.\n3. Create migrations using add-migration DomainModel\n4. Run the app and notice that the account pages work\n5. Switch from using SqlServer to Sqlite\n6. Blow away existing migrations and then run add-migration Initial\n7. run Update-database\n8. Use VisualStudio to create a CRUD set of pages for one of the objects defiend in the data model.\n9. Add a link to the Index for that CRUD into the nav menu and delete the Weather and the Counter pages and links.\n10. Run the app and notice that the /Account pages no longer work.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nNo exceptions just no joy.\n\n### .NET Version\n\n dotnet --version => 8.0.403\n\n### Anything else?\n\nEverything you need to reproduce the issue is in the github repository.

Our application handles large datasets (e.g., 10,000 records), and during export operations, the entire web page becomes unresponsive, preventing any further user interaction until the export completes.\n\nIn Blazor Server, we have successfully maintained UI responsiveness by utilizing multi-threading with Task.Run, as shown below:\n\n**Before:**\n\n`csharp\n\nawait ExportHelper(GridModel, DataSource);\nusing MemoryStream outputStream = new MemoryStream();\n_workbook.Save(outputStream, IsCsvExport);\n`\n\n**After:**\n\n`csharp\n\nawait Task.Run(() => ExportHelper(GridModel, DataSource)).ConfigureAwait(false);\n\nusing MemoryStream outputStream = new MemoryStream();\n\nawait Task.Run(() => _workbook.Save(outputStream, IsCsvExport)).ConfigureAwait(false);`\n\nWhile this approach works effectively in Blazor Server, it does not yield the same results in Blazor WebAssembly. The single-threaded nature of WebAssembly causes the export operation to block the UI thread, rendering the page unresponsive.\n\nWe have attempted to split the data source and apply Task.Yield in WebAssembly to enhance responsiveness, but these efforts have not been successful.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWe aim to achieve similar UI responsiveness in Blazor WebAssembly as we experience in Blazor Server, allowing users to interact with the page during export operations.\n\nRequest:\n\nWe kindly request consideration for adding support for responsive, non-blocking long-running tasks (e.g., data exports) in Blazor WebAssembly. This enhancement would enable us to maintain an interactive UI for end-users.\n\n**Environment Details:**\n\nDevice: DELL Latitude 3410\nBrowser: Chrome\nBlazor WebAssembly Version: 8.0.0\n\n### .NET Version\n\nBlazor WebAssembly Version: 8.0.0\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58836","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Interactable UI During Exporting in Blazor WebAssembly\" (#58836)"},{"Id":"2642942242","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-08T05:46:04","Actor":"abhaysharma3021","Number":"58835","RawContent":null,"Title":"JwtSecurityTokenHandler.ReadJwtToken is not reading the issuer","State":"open","Body":"Hi,\n\nI'm using ASP.NET Core 8 Web API, and I encountered an \"Unauthorized\" error with the token I generated.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

For example, the options associated with that scheme should be configured correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.SuppressAutoDefaultScheme` app context flag.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Changes in default authentication scheme handling for ASP.NET Core\" (#490)"},{"Id":"1287742787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T18:44:22","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"488","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs detailed in dotnet/aspnetcore#42413, the file-serving middleware (`DefaultFilesMiddleware`, `DirectoryBrowserMiddleware`, and `StaticFileMiddleware`) have been updated to no longer no-op (i.e. defer to the next middleware in the pipeline) in the case that there is an active endpoint with a `null` request delegate.\r\n\r\nPR that makes the change: dotnet/aspnetcore#42458\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nPreviously, if the current request had an active endpoint, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint() != null`, the file-serving middleware would perform no action and simply delegate to the next middleware in the request pipeline.\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe file-serving middleware will now only perform no action if there is an active endpoint and its `RequestDelegate` property value is not `null`, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint()?.RequestDelegate is not null`.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThis change will enable endpoints to be active in the request for the purposes of setting and sharing metadata with middleware that are endpoint-aware so that they can perform their intended function, while allowing other middleware (like the file-serving middleware) that would usually defer their behavior when an endpoint is active to also function.\r\n\r\nFor example, an endpoint with a `null` request delegate containing authorization metadata can be set as the active endpoint for a request, causing the `AuthorizationMiddleware` to enforce authorization requirements, which if satisfied would allow the `StaticFileMiddleware` to serve the requested files.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you are relying on setting an active endpoint on the request to suppress the behavior of the file-serving middleware, ensure that the endpoint has a non-null value set for its `RequestDelegate` property.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseStaticFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDefaultFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDirectoryBrowser()`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active\" (#488)"},{"Id":"1278667050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T16:03:03","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"487","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Unit testing SignalR Hubs may need updating","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`IHubClients` and `IHubCallerClients` now hide interface members `IClientProxy Client(string connectionId);` and `IClientProxy Caller { get;

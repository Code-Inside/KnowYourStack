Because CancellationTokenSource.TryReset() is not thread-safe, concurrent calls to Cancel() made by CancelRequestAbortedTokenCallback() on a background thread can end up being ignored.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/2dbdff1a7aebd64b4b265d99b173cd77f088c36e/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Threading/CancellationTokenSource.cs#L477-L479\r\n\r\nI observed exactly this when debugging a hanging test from [Send MCP-Protocol-Version header in Streamable HTTP client transport · modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk@735be0f](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/actions/runs/15717633269/attempts/1) by looking at the memory dump from [testresults-windows-latest-Release](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/actions/runs/15717633269/artifacts/3349122960). There you can see that there's a SSE request hanging because RequestAborted never firing despite ConnectionContext.ConnectionClosed firing and Http1Connection._connectionAborted being set.\r\n\r\nI think this is definitely the right change for HTTP/1.1, and I copied the CanReuse logic from HTTP/2 for HTTP/3 so it hopefully shouldn't cause issues there, but please double check this @JamesNK. If the new logic does cause issues, it likely means the previous logic was even more broken for HTTP/3, because that would mean _connectionAborted could be Reset() to false while CancelRequestAbortedTokenCallback() from a call to HttpContext.Abort() from a previous request was still scheduled on the thread pool.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I made _connectionAborted a terminal state and never reset _abortedCts to null. I think the only alternatives would be to somehow synchronize with the CancelRequestAbortedTokenCallback() and delay resetting until that completes or to not pool altogether.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62385","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Avoid race that can cause Kestrel's RequestAborted to not fire\" (#62385)"},{"Id":"3154835615","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T21:40:02","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"62384","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Register persistent component state services in AddBlazorWebView","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds registration of persistent component state services to the `AddBlazorWebView` extension method, enabling persistent component state functionality in Blazor WebView applications.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n- Added `ComponentStatePersistenceManager` service registration as scoped\n- Added `PersistentComponentState` service registration as scoped with factory that retrieves the State property from the manager\n- Added necessary using statement for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Infrastructure`\n- Added comprehensive unit tests to verify services are registered correctly with proper lifetime scope\n\n## Problem\n\nPreviously, Blazor WebView applications couldn't use persistent component state because the required services (`ComponentStatePersistenceManager` and `PersistentComponentState`) were not registered in the service collection. Components that tried to inject `PersistentComponentState` would fail at runtime.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe fix follows the same pattern used in `RazorComponentsServiceCollectionExtensions.AddRazorComponents`:\n\n```csharp\nservices.TryAddScoped<ComponentStatePersistenceManager>();\nservices.TryAddScoped<PersistentComponentState>(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<ComponentStatePersistenceManager>().State);\n```\n\nThis enables Blazor WebView applications to use persistent component state just like server-side and WebAssembly applications.\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded unit tests that verify:\n- Services are registered and can be resolved from the service provider\n- Services are registered with the correct scoped lifetime\n- The `PersistentComponentState` service correctly returns the State property from the manager\n\nFixes #62383.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

The PR unifies the navigation across render modes but also allows SSR code after the navigation to run. Upgrading the application could lead to unexpected behaviors, e.g. see how templates had to be changed to adjust to the new navigation: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62105. From this reason, we decided to keep the default behavior for the exception flow. It can be changed by setting `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Endpoints.NavigationManager.DisableThrowNavigationException` switch. New projects will use the new way of working.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nIt will keep the behavior same as net9, without the need to change code if users upgrade to net10.\r\n\r\n##

preload assets (#62225)","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\n\nUsing link headers for preloading in Blazor WebAssembly applications has several disadvantages:\n\n- It's complicated to correctly identify the root without doing per-request processing\n- It's more indirect when people want to turn the feature off\n\nFor these reasons, we have decided to switch to a component-based approach. Thanks to the `<base href=\"...\">` element, preload links are correctly rooted.\n\nThis PR introduces a `<LinkPreload />` component that, when an InteractiveWebAssembly component is present on the page, generates preloading links into the place where the component is used (in the HTML head, after the `<base href=\"...\">`). If there isn't any InteractiveWebAssembly component, the component does nothing.\n\nThis change addresses issues with preload links not being properly rooted for app start from deep links in Blazor WebAssembly applications.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\n+namespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\n+{\n+    public class LinkPreload : ComponentBase\n+    {\n+        public LinkPreload() { }\n+    }\n+}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```razor\n<!-- In App.razor or _Host.cshtml -->\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <base href=\"/\" />\n    <LinkPreload />\n    <!-- Other head content -->\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Body content -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe component automatically detects if InteractiveWebAssembly rendering is being used and only generates preload links when appropriate:\n\n```razor\n@page \"/\"\n@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly\n\n<h1>My Blazor App</h1>\n<!-- LinkPreload component in the head will generate preload links for this page -->\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nThe previous approach used HTTP link headers to communicate preload directives. While this worked, it required server-side processing to correctly root the URLs based on the request path, making it more complex and less flexible.\n\nThe component-based approach was chosen for its simplicity and automatic integration with the existing `<base>` element.\n\n## Risks\n\n1. **Placement Dependency**: The component must be placed after the `<base href=\"...\">` element to ensure URLs are correctly rooted. Incorrect placement could result in broken preload links.\n\n2. **Template Updates**: Existing Blazor applications will need to manually add the `<LinkPreload />` component to benefit from this feature, though the BlazorWeb template will include it by default.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Api proposal for Use <LinkPreload /> component to preload assets (#62225)\" (#62374)"},{"Id":"3153331574","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T12:30:49","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"62373","RawContent":null,"Title":"API proposal for Circuit state persistence","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\n\nThe current Blazor Server circuit persistence mechanism has limitations that impact scalability and user experience. This proposal introduces improvements to circuit state persistence with the following key changes:\n\n- **HybridCache Integration**: We now rely on HybridCache for handling storage to distributed storage mechanisms, eliminating the need to create individual packages for different distributed backends (Redis, Blob Storage, etc.)\n- **Memory-Efficient Default Implementation**: A default implementation leveraging MemoryCache (similar to disconnected circuits in CircuitRegistry) that stores a limited number of persisted circuits for a longer period (2 hours by default)\n- **Optimized Resource Usage**: The persisted state typically consumes only dozens to hundreds of KB of memory, similar to prerendering constraints where pushing more than 100KB starts to degrade the experience\n\nKey benefits of persisting state over keeping circuits alive:\n- Disconnected circuits might continue consuming CPU and memory resources even when not in use\n- Persisted state consumes a fixed amount of memory that developers can control\n- The persisted state represents only a subset of the total memory consumed by the application (without tracking individual components)\n\nThe default retention period of 2 hours is chosen as a trade-off between average session duration and the percentage of circuits that fail to resume due to discarded state. Applications can adjust this based on their specific usage patterns.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server\n{\n    public sealed class CircuitOptions\n    {\n+        public int PersistedCircuitInMemoryMaxRetained { get; set; }\n+        public TimeSpan PersistedCircuitInMemoryRetentionPeriod { get; set; }\n+        public HybridCache? HybridPersistenceCache { get; set; }\n+        public TimeSpan? PersistedCircuitDistributedRetentionPeriod { get; set; }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTypeScript APIs for client-side control:\n```typescript\ninterface Blazor {\n+    pause(): void;\n+    resume(): void;\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Configuring Circuit Persistence Options\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor(options =>\n{\n    // Configure in-memory retention\n    options.PersistedCircuitInMemoryMaxRetained = 100; // Maximum 100 circuits in memory\n    options.PersistedCircuitInMemoryRetentionPeriod = TimeSpan.FromHours(2); // Keep for 2 hours\n    \n    // Configure distributed cache retention (when using HybridCache)\n    options.PersistedCircuitDistributedRetentionPeriod = TimeSpan.FromHours(24); // Keep in distributed cache for 24 hours\n});\n\n// Add HybridCache with Redis backend\nbuilder.Services.AddHybridCache(options =>\n{\n    options.DefaultEntryOptions = new HybridCacheEntryOptions\n    {\n        Expiration = TimeSpan.FromHours(24),\n        LocalCacheExpiration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)\n    };\n});\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n```\n\n### Client-Side Circuit Control\n```javascript\n// Pause the circuit when the page becomes hidden (tab change, minimizing)\ndocument.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {\n  if (document.hidden) {\n    Blazor.pause();\n  } else {\n    Blazor.resume();\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n### Configuring with Custom HybridCache Implementation\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor(options =>\n{\n    // Use a custom HybridCache instance\n    var customCache = new ServiceCollection().AddHybridCache().BuildServiceProvider().   GetRequiredService<HybridCache>();\n    options.HybridPersistenceCache = customCache;\n});\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nAutomatically persisting circuit state in a distributed cache without explicit developer configuration was considered, but it was deemed too opaque and could lead to unexpected behavior. The proposed approach allows developers to control persistence settings explicitly and define their own policies for when to pause or resume circuits.\n\n## Risks\n\n1. **Memory Pressure**: Applications with high traffic may need to carefully tune `PersistedCircuitInMemoryMaxRetained` to avoid memory pressure. The default of storing limited circuits mitigates this risk.\n\n2. **State Size Limitations**: Large component states (>100KB) will degrade the user experience, similar to prerendering.

During prerendering, the parent component hierarchy differed from interactive mode, leading to inconsistent key generation and failed state persistence for root components.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Core Changes\n\n1. **Added `ComponentState.GetComponentKey()`** - New protected virtual method that extracts `@key` directives from the parent component's render tree, providing a consistent interface across render modes.\n\n2. **Enhanced `EndpointComponentState`** - Overrides `GetComponentKey()` to detect `SSRRenderModeBoundary` components and return the `ComponentMarkerKey` for consistent root component identification.\n\n3. **Specialized ComponentState subclasses** - Created `WebAssemblyComponentState` and `RemoteComponentState` that accept `ComponentMarkerKey` parameters and return them from `GetComponentKey()` when available.\n\n4. **Improved key computation** - Moved `ComputeKey` logic to `ComponentState` with enhanced parent type filtering that excludes `SSRRenderModeBoundary` components from the hierarchy calculation.\n\n5. **SSRRenderModeBoundary helper** - Added `GetComponentMarkerKey()` method to expose the internal marker key for state persistence.\n\n### Key Algorithm\n\nThe solution ensures consistent key generation by:\n- Using the same `ComputeKey` algorithm across all render modes\n- Providing `ComponentMarkerKey` consistently for root components\n- Filtering out `SSRRenderModeBoundary` from parent type calculations\n- Maintaining serializable key validation\n\n## Example\n\nBefore this fix, a root component with state persistence would fail:\n\n```csharp\n@rendermode InteractiveServer\n<div>\n    <p>Counter: @count</p>\n    <button @onclick=\"Increment\">Increment</button>\n</div>\n\n@code {\n    [SupplyParameterFromPersistentComponentState]\n    private int count { get; set; } = 0;\n\n    private void Increment() => count++;\n}\n```\n\nThe `count` value would be lost during prerender-to-interactive transitions because different keys were generated in each mode. With this fix, the same key is used consistently, preserving the state.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Updated all existing tests to use the new `ComponentState.ComputeKey()` API\n- Added comprehensive validation for cross-render-mode key consistency\n- Maintained backward compatibility for the key generation algorithm\n- Verified proper `ComponentMarkerKey` integration\n\nFixes #62331.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

The shared `PropertyHelper` class already had the correct implementation pattern.\n\n## Solution\n\nUpdated `PropertyGetter` to follow the same pattern as the shared `PropertyHelper`:\n\n1. **Added value type support**: Added `ByRefFunc<TDeclaringType, TValue>` delegate type for by-reference property access on value types\n2. **Added wrapper method**: Added `CallPropertyGetterByReference` method to handle value type property access\n3. **Fixed delegate creation**: Used correct two-step delegate creation pattern and ensured wrapper methods return `object?` for compatibility\n4. **Added comprehensive tests**: Added tests for `int`, `int?`, and tuple value type properties\n\n## Key Changes\n\n- Added `ByRefFunc<TDeclaringType, TValue>` delegate type for value types\n- Added `CallPropertyGetterByReference` method for by-reference property access\n- Fixed wrapper method signatures to return `object?` instead of `TValue` for delegate compatibility\n- Added logic to check `getMethod.DeclaringType.IsValueType` and use appropriate delegate creation path\n- Added comprehensive unit tests covering various value type scenarios\n\n## Testing\n\n- ✅ All existing tests pass (no regressions)\n- ✅ New tests for `int` and `int?` value types pass\n- ✅ PropertyGetter correctly extracts values from value type properties\n- ❌ Tuple tests fail due to separate System.Text.Json serialization issue (not related to PropertyGetter)\n\nThe PropertyGetter now correctly handles value type properties without throwing delegate creation exceptions.\n\nFixes #62368.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

It works fine in .net 8 and 9.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWe expect that kestrel will somehow get the Environment name into the blazor app. The console statement that logs to the browser should show the very same environment that is logged to the host console as kestrel launches.\n\nIt seems there should be a Blazor-Environment header on one of the blazor files, but I couldn't find any that had it. In .net 8 and .net 9 for example, blazor.boot.json has this header set on it. In .net 10 preview, I didn't actually see this file at all.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nUsing VIsual Studio 2022 or 2022 preview, create a blazor standalone wasm app using the template. Accept the defaults (no auth, etc) to keep it simple.\n\nIn Program.cs, after the line:\n`var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);`\n\nPlace:\n`Console.WriteLine($\"Client Hosting Environment: {builder.HostEnvironment.Environment}\");`\n\nUse `dotnet run` to launch the app. In all 3 .net versions, it will log to the console: \n\n\"info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]\n      Hosting environment: Development\"\n\nBut when you open your browser and look at its console, this value carried over only in .net 8 and .net 9.\n\nIn .net 8 and .net 9 apps, \"Development\" is logged to the browser console. In .net 10 preview 5 apps, it's \"Production\" that is logged.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100-preview.5.25277.114\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62362","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[.net 10 Preview 5] Blazor wasm stand-alone app HostEnvironment is \"Production\" in development mode\" (#62362)"},{"Id":"3149627307","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-16T11:23:18","Actor":"Kuldip4053","Number":"62361","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor Server Session Manage","State":"open","Body":"\"Hi, I want to manage user sessions in a Blazor Server application with the following requirements:\"\n\nNo JavaScript – I do not want to use any JavaScript for session handling.\n\nMulti-tab session sync – If the app is opened in multiple tabs in the same browser, starting or updating a session in one tab should automatically reflect in all the other tabs.\n\nSession persistence on page refresh – The session should remain active and accessible even after refreshing the page.\n\nNo Entity Framework – I don't want to use Entity Framework or any database ORM.\n\nNo third-party packages – I want to achieve this only with built-in .NET/Blazor tools, without relying on external libraries.\n\nServer-side session management – The session data should be stored and managed on the server.\n\nNo cookies\n\ni need somthing like mvc Session","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62361","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor Server Session Manage\" (#62361)"},{"Id":"3148549481","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-16T05:02:16","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"62357","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/extensions","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:11a4fe08-b74d-4c15-1004-08dcbc30275f)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/extensions\n- **Subscription**: [11a4fe08-b74d-4c15-1004-08dcbc30275f](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=11a4fe08-b74d-4c15-1004-08dcbc30275f)\n- **Build**: [20250613.1](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2729432)\n- **Date Produced**: June 13, 2025 9:08:06 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: [694b95ef75c6bd9de00ef761dadae4e70ee8739f](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/commit/694b95ef75c6bd9de00ef761dadae4e70ee8739f)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - **Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Testing**: [from 9.7.0-preview.1.25306.2 to 9.7.0-preview.1.25313.1][1]\n  - **Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing**: [from 9.7.0-preview.1.25306.2 to 9.7.0-preview.1.25313.1][1]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/compare/04bd58871e...694b95ef75\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:11a4fe08-b74d-4c15-1004-08dcbc30275f)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62357","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/9.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/extensions\" (#62357)"},{"Id":"3148308728","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-16T02:02:13","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"62356","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"open","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

For example, the options associated with that scheme should be configured correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.SuppressAutoDefaultScheme` app context flag.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Changes in default authentication scheme handling for ASP.NET Core\" (#490)"},{"Id":"1287742787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T18:44:22","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"488","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs detailed in dotnet/aspnetcore#42413, the file-serving middleware (`DefaultFilesMiddleware`, `DirectoryBrowserMiddleware`, and `StaticFileMiddleware`) have been updated to no longer no-op (i.e. defer to the next middleware in the pipeline) in the case that there is an active endpoint with a `null` request delegate.\r\n\r\nPR that makes the change: dotnet/aspnetcore#42458\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nPreviously, if the current request had an active endpoint, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint() != null`, the file-serving middleware would perform no action and simply delegate to the next middleware in the request pipeline.\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe file-serving middleware will now only perform no action if there is an active endpoint and its `RequestDelegate` property value is not `null`, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint()?.RequestDelegate is not null`.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThis change will enable endpoints to be active in the request for the purposes of setting and sharing metadata with middleware that are endpoint-aware so that they can perform their intended function, while allowing other middleware (like the file-serving middleware) that would usually defer their behavior when an endpoint is active to also function.\r\n\r\nFor example, an endpoint with a `null` request delegate containing authorization metadata can be set as the active endpoint for a request, causing the `AuthorizationMiddleware` to enforce authorization requirements, which if satisfied would allow the `StaticFileMiddleware` to serve the requested files.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you are relying on setting an active endpoint on the request to suppress the behavior of the file-serving middleware, ensure that the endpoint has a non-null value set for its `RequestDelegate` property.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseStaticFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDefaultFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDirectoryBrowser()`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active\" (#488)"},{"Id":"1278667050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T16:03:03","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"487","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Unit testing SignalR Hubs may need updating","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`IHubClients` and `IHubCallerClients` now hide interface members `IClientProxy Client(string connectionId);` and `IClientProxy Caller { get;

Global interactive + any page that requires static mode (httpcontext) -> break at run-time\r\n2. Component that runs in mode X but add a tag for component C that uses mode Y -> break at run-time\r\n3. No global interactive + add some interactive component to any sub component -> break at run-time\r\n4. Any non-trivial Mode Auto or WebAssembly -> break at run-time ('cannot find root')\r\n5. Culture setting on server with Mode Auto or WebAssembly -> break at run-time (reverts to browser language detection)\r\n6. Mode Auto or WebAssembly on project without a dedicated WebAssembly Project -> break at run-time ('dotnet.js 404')\r\n7. Mode Auto or WebAssembly for 3rd party libraries -> break at run-time (because users suck)\r\n8. Fallback policy RequireAuthenticationUser -> break at run-time (cannot access blazor.web.js)\r\n9. Shared JsonSerializerContext between server and webassembly -> break at run-time (because server uses JsonSerializerDefaults.Web, and webassembly use JsonSerializerDefaults.General)\r\n10. Use IJSRuntime explicity or implicitly -> break at run-time (because all modes pre-render)\r\n11. Interactive server with rollover or canary deployment, or any kind of deployment scenario really -> break at run-time \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThat blazor was useable beyond toy projects.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nGet a jr dev to play around with blazor for a few days and see how often they will shoot themselves in the foot.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n8.0.100-rc.2.23502.2\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51837","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"net8 blazor interactive modes are so flaky to work with\" (#51837)"},{"Id":"1975293109","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-03T01:22:24","Actor":"davhdavh","Number":"51836","RawContent":null,"Title":"MapRazorComponents broken with FallbackPolicy RequireAuthenticatedUser","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIt seems fallback policy is broken for all blazor modes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nservices.AddAuthorization(o => o.FallbackPolicy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder().RequireAuthenticatedUser().Build());\r\n...\r\napp.UseStaticFiles();\r\napp.UseAuth...();\r\napp.MapRazorComponents<App>()\r\n   .AddInteractiveServerRenderMode();\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in a redirect to login when requesting `/_framework/blazor.web.js`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nservices.AddAuthorization(o => o.FallbackPolicy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder().RequireAuthenticatedUser().Build());\r\n...\r\napp.UseStaticFiles();\r\napp.MapRazorComponents<App>()\r\n   .AddInteractiveServerRenderMode();\r\napp.UseAuth...();\r\n```\r\n\r\nALSO results in a redirect to login when requesting `/_framework/blazor.web.js`.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPutting Maps before UseAuth... => no auth check\r\nPutting Maps after UseAuth... => auth check for pages, but not for staticfiles\r\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSee above\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nNo\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.100-rc.2.23502.2\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51836","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"MapRazorComponents broken with FallbackPolicy RequireAuthenticatedUser\" (#51836)"},{"Id":"1975202688","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-02T23:36:35","Actor":"ms-kgorgi","Number":"51835","RawContent":null,"Title":"ProjectName.deploy.cmd fails on IISExpressUserProfileDirectory check fails if Documents folder is OneDrive synced","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI am attempting to deploy an ASP.NET application through the command line with ProjectName.deploy.cmd.

Enabling it can be used to achieve the same behavior as with the `authPersistNonNTLM` option in IIS.\r\n\r\n#### Change details:\r\n\r\n- The groundwork change c50346d52569c318f6a1 fixes an existing issue in the definition/layout of the `HTTP_SERVER_AUTHENTICATION_INFO` interop structure.\r\n\r\n- The core change 7489786de9e65730ad45 exposes both flags as options in the authentication manager.  Because setting the extended flags requires a different property type (`HttpServerExtendedAuthenticationProperty`), we take additional precaution to only use that property type if we actually have the

Improvements","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nThis template is useful to build consensus about whether work should be done, and if so, the high-level shape of how it should be approached. Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nBlazor Wasm has a large bundle size and there's no way to avoid this. However there are steps to improve UX during loading. We use Blazor in production for thousands of our customers and quite happy with it but we had to implement quite complex loader by ourselves which solves the issues I want to describe this design proposal. \r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\nVery first application experience must go for a user as smooth as possible, thus Blazor loader should provide better capabilities than it does right now.\r\n\r\n## In scope\r\n\r\nHere's the list that we had to implement in our DIY loader (it took us substantial amount of efforts in development and what's more important in testing. It'd be nice if those features would be available for everyone out of the box.\r\n1. Downloading progress in bytes should be available ( #46549). As of now blazor provides % of downloaded bundle. It just counts files to be downloaded vs downloading ignoring that >50% of the bundle is dotnet.wasm file. Thus progress would stuck on the last step for a long time pissing off users badly.\r\n1. Better CDN integration:\r\n     1. Append hashes to file names in the bundle (#47575 ). Replacing files on CDN is quite bad idea because of heavy caching. We have experienced crashes of the application i production because wrong old version of some DLL was loaded. Blazor already computes hashes and exposes them through blazor.boot.json. Why not giving an option to append them to the file name? IMO, it should be default option like JS frameworks do.\r\n     3. Give an ability to control maximum individual file size in the bundle to enable compression CDNs (#51772)\r\n\r\n## In conclusion\r\n\r\nSince Blazor loader allows for any kind of customization it let us implement our requirements which is good. However, there's nothing extraordinary in those demands.

Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe current incarnation of HttpLoggingInterceptor allows limited extensibility of Log lines, but is insufficient to also be used for other forms of telemetry needed for operational services. Most importantly it is called prior to the response being completely sent - this means that the latency of the call is not known (and cannot be used for manipulating metrics counters) and that there is a risk of an exception being thown after the OnResponseAsync callback occurs leading to erroneous measurements of success.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\nAny services operating at scale will require both logging and metrics as part of their operational telemetry. For HTTP services this means a reliable means of measuring and recording each incoming HTTP request in terms of: \r\n* success (did it complete successfully with an appropriate status code)\r\n* latency (end to end)\r\n* any error details (in the failure case)\r\n\r\nCurrently the HttpLogging middleware does a reasonable job of allowing a logging solution for incoming HTTP requests, although ideally it would allow the developer some control over the LogLevel (so that failing requests could be promoted to Warning or Error), LogCategory (allowing easy rerouting of just the request completion logs), and potentially ID (to help prevent id clashes).\r\nThe current system can be used to log a single combined log line if the CombineLogs option is set in the HttpLoggingOptions, and Duration can be added there to help measure latencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, the callback for OnResponseAsync is fired before the response complete. This can lead to multiple issues:\r\n* The callback can record a log line detailing success for a call which later fails during the response write\r\n* The duration is not available at this point, so the extension point can not be used to update metrics associated with latency (and given the previous point it cannot be used to reliably update metrics around success counts either).\r\n\r\n## In scope\r\n\r\nIdeally the HttpLogging middleware could be expanded to provide a more complete set of extension points for people implementing operational telemetry. Ideally it would guarantee a single callback firing among the following set:\r\n* OnResponseCompletedAsync (after a response is successfully transmitted, with latency data provided)\r\n* OnErrorAsync (after an unhandled exception is thrown, with details of the exception)\r\n\r\nThis starts to look a lot like the current HostingDiagnostics features, which are also currently problematic due to the risk of double counting in error cases, and many of the event payloads being internal/private and requiring reflection to be used. Currently there is no clear path for a developer wishing to add custom telemetry to the system aside from adding a custom middleware layer. When being called at scale this risks accidentally adding large numbers of allocations/GC strain leading to system performance degradation over time.\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\n\r\nScenarios you explicitly want to exclude.\r\n\r\n## Risks / unknowns\r\n\r\nThere is some risk here that if the callbacks are inline that they will still potentially impact performance. Ideally there would be some decoupling here to minimize risk.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class MyHttpTelemetryInterceptor : IHttpLoggingInterceptor\r\n{\r\n        public ValueTask OnResponseCompleteAsync(HttpLoggingInterceptorContext logContext)\r\n        {\r\n            // Enrich log line based on context values\r\n           EnrichLog(logContext.HttpContext);\r\n           \r\n            // Update status based counters\r\n           UpdateSuccessCounters(logContext.HttpContext, logContext.GetDuration());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public ValueTask OnErrorAsync(HttpLoggingInterceptorContext logContext)\r\n        {\r\n            // Enrich log line based on exception details\r\n           EnrichLog(logContext.HttpContext, logContext.Exception);\r\n           \r\n            // Update failure counters\r\n           UpdateFailureCounters(logContext.HttpContext, logContext.GetDuration(), logContext.Exception);\r\n

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For example the [OnTokenValidated](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/bf303a1092f83d789031fdafac60f3fc454cfc49/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/JwtBearerEvents.cs#L29) event is fired when a security token is validated. These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT. These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

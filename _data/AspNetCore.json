Please describe the problem.\n\nDue to the WebTransport PR adding support for unidirectional streams that are not control streams, Kestrel now must read the stream type from the stream header prior to classifying it and making a `Http3Stream` or `Http3ControlStream` instance for it. To still be able to track this stream, and enforce timeouts and other aborts, the PR introduced a new stream type, `Http3PendingStream`. This is a short-lived stream that fulfills this issue. It is a rather inefficient solution though as it increases the number of allocations and decreases the performance for all HTTP/3 stream requests.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThere are multiple possible solutions. For example, we could pool the streams and then re-use them. However, perhaps the best solution would be to rethink how streams are defined. Perhaps the best solution would actually be to rewrite streams entirely so that they follow a decorator pattern or something similar. That way we can add functionality as we identify the stream rather than having to create new objects as we go along. \r\n\r\nThis would also have the added benefit of deduplicating shared code between stream types. Currently, there is quite a bit of it, and it is quite hard to remove, as I found out when I tried to do something similar via extending a common base class for all stream types.\r\n\r\nAn alternative design might be a factory or provider pattern as we could set values in the factory and provider and then only create the final stream object once the stream has been identified. The issue with this approach however is that it does two times the allocations in the worst case (even with pooling) as for each incoming stream we need to allocate a factory and a stream.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42789","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Performance optimizations for streams now that the WebTransport PR introduced new stream types\" (#42789)"},{"Id":"1308283205","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-18T17:27:43","Actor":"Daniel-Genkin-MS-2","Number":"42788","RawContent":null,"Title":"WebTransport PR follow-ups","State":"open","Body":"To avoid making the WebTransport PR even more massive and because of time constraints, I was not able to implement everything in it.

This might be a bit challenging though as I was unable to find any working client when I checked a little while ago. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be great to implement WebTransport over HTTP/2 as a fallback for when HTTP/3 is unavailable. I believe this is the main use case for it. However, it does have support for directly initiating a connection over HTTP/2 which might also be useful for some folks.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would use the same API as the WebTransport over HTTP3 but the underlying connection management would be different. All the WebTransport specific features in The WebTransport over HTTP/3 spec should be transferable to HTTP/2 in theory, although features that are inherited from QUIC would not.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42785","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Implementing WebTransport over HTTP/2\" (#42785)"},{"Id":"1308272859","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-18T17:20:27","Actor":"Daniel-Genkin-MS-2","Number":"42784","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding datagrams support to WebTransport","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI implemented streams over WebTransport but did not have time to also implement datagrams. Adding datagram support would make the API more useful and help to provide a more universal implementation that is more consistent with the WebTransport spec. Currently, to allow WebTransport to function with the Chromium WebTransport implementation, we fake supporting datagrams and just ignore them whenever they are received. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nDatagrams actually extend beyond just WebTransport. In fact, there is a \"datagrams over HTTP/3\" specification (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-masque-h3-datagram-11). The main challenge will actually be the datagrams over HTTP/3 implementation rather than datagrams over WebTransport as the WebTransport side should be relatively trivial (https://ietf-wg-webtrans.github.io/draft-ietf-webtrans-http3/draft-ietf-webtrans-http3.html#name-datagrams).\r\n\r\nThe ideal flow is to have datagram streams (preferably via the `ConnectionContext` type) that the application can accept. Then the application will be able to read and write the same way they currently do for WebTransport streams.\r\n\r\nThis functionality will also have the added benefit of more detailed error and close messages in the WebTransport session. This will help to make more meaningful logs when something unexpected happens as WebTransport carries error messages as datagrams over the connect stream.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42784","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Adding datagrams support to WebTransport\" (#42784)"},{"Id":"1307587359","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-18T16:20:54","Actor":"takczyowak","Number":"42773","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool inconsistent versioning","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhole issue has some history which is described [here](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-csharp/issues/332).

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable.

Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

As a result, we have decided to drop React-Redux support in .NET 6 preview 6. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in [issue #27887](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27887) we shared we will be introducing a new experience for SPA templates in .NET 6 timeframe. This experience is going to focus on decoupling the frontend from the backend into two separate projects. For details here. So, even though we are dropping React-Redux in preview 6 we are providing flexibility for our customers to bring in any SPA framework for their choosing.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

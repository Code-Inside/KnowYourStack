Documentation tooling often has to re-parse that text to reconstruct routing details that endpoint routing already knows. This leads to mismatches, especially when templates use special prefixes (like ~) or when constraints/defaults can’t be inferred from the string. The goal here is to make the routing engine’s authoritative RoutePattern available to tools that build OpenAPI documents, generate API overviews, or analyze routes. Existing behavior of RelativePath remains unchanged.\n\n#64408 surfaces the canonical RoutePattern from RouteEndpoint (and from attribute routes). This gives documentation generators a reliable, structured view of the actual routed pattern and eliminates re-parsing heuristics.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer;\n\npublic class ApiDescription\n{\n+    public Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Patterns.RoutePattern? RoutePattern { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```\nvar pattern = apiDescription.RoutePattern ?? RoutePatternFactory.Parse(apiDescription.RelativePath!);\n```\n\n## Risks\n\n- Nullability: Property is marked as nullable to support binary compute. Some providers won’t set RoutePattern; fallbacks need to be set in consuming code.\n- Layering: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Abstractions` now has a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing`. It already has a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions`.\n\n\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64412","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add `RoutePattern` property to `ApiDescription`\" (#64412)"},{"Id":"3635632586","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-18T00:55:20","Actor":"mattgreen","Number":"64411","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hot reload: gray overlay shown with no error messages","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n`dotnet watch` with a bare bones Blazor SSR project shows a gray overlay after detecting CSS changes.

// Previously crashed, now works\n```\n\n**Changes:**\n- Added `RoutePattern` property to `ApiDescription`\n- Updated both API description providers to set the property\n- Modified `MapRelativePathToItemPath` to use pre-parsed pattern\n- Added routing assembly reference to Mvc.Abstractions\n- Updated PublicAPI files\n\n**Tests:**\n- Added 3 unit tests verifying routes starting with `~`\n- Added integration test for minimal API endpoints with `~` routes\n- Added integration test for MVC controller actions with `~` routes\n\nFixes #60967\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi: The route template cannot start with a '~' character</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Is there an existing issue for this?\n> \n> - [x] I have searched the existing issues\n> \n> ### Describe the bug\n> \n> The OpenApi generator crashes on routes that starts with a '~' character.\n> \n> e.g.\n> \n> ```c#\n> app.MapGet(\"/~health\", () => Results.Ok(\"Works\"));\n> ```\n> \n> While the endpoint \"/~health\" works as expected, the openapi endpoint crashes\n> \n> ### Expected Behavior\n> \n> The OpenApi impl should also be compatible with routes that start with ~ (like aspnetcore does).\n> \n> The ~ may not be pretty from a design approach but the behavior of the OpenApi generator should match the behavior of aspnetcore.\n> \n> _Offtopic:\n> We are currently considering to migrate from `/~endpoint` to `/.endpoint` because we ship internally some default endpoints on every app_\n> \n> ### Steps To Reproduce\n> \n> ```\n> var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n> \n> builder.Services.AddOpenApi();\n> \n> var app = builder.Build();\n> \n> app.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello World!\");\n> \n> app.MapGet(\"/~health\", () => Results.Ok(\"Works\"));\n> \n> app.MapOpenApi();\n> \n> app.Run();\n> \n> ```\n> \n> ### Exceptions (if any)\n> \n> ```\n> Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Patterns.RoutePatternException: The route template cannot start with a '~' character unless followed by a '/'.\n>    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Patterns.RoutePatternParser.TrimPrefix(String routePattern)\n>    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Patterns.RoutePatternParser.Parse(String pattern)\n>    at ApiDescriptionExtensions.MapRelativePathToItemPath(ApiDescription apiDescription)\n>    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.OpenApiDocumentService.<>c.<GetOpenApiPathsAsync>b__20_1(ApiDescription apiDescription)\n>    at System.Linq.Lookup`2.Create(IEnumerable`1 source, Func`2 keySelector, IEqualityComparer`1 comparer)\n>    at System.Linq.Enumerable.GroupByIterator`2.MoveNext()\n>    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.OpenApiDocumentService.GetOpenApiPathsAsync(OpenApiDocument document, IServiceProvider scopedServiceProvider, IOpenApiOperationTransformer[] operationTransformers, IOpenApiSchemaTransformer[] schemaTransformers, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n>    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.OpenApiDocumentService.GetOpenApiDocumentAsync(IServiceProvider scopedServiceProvider, HttpRequest httpRequest, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n>    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.OpenApiEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.<>c__DisplayClass0_0.<<MapOpenApi>b__0>d.MoveNext()\n> --- End of stack trace from previous location ---\n>    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Generated.<GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensions_g>F0399B8B15BE443123F4BECEE84B112C1912EE3F44D9DDD7BFA38E371FB917343__GeneratedRouteBuilderExtensionsCore.<>c__DisplayClass2_0.<<MapGet0>g__RequestHandler|5>d.MoveNext()\n> --- End of stack trace from previous location ---\n>    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.DeveloperExceptionPageMiddlewareImpl.Invoke(HttpContext context)\n> ```\n> \n> ### .NET Version\n> \n> 10.0.100\n> \n> ### Anything else?\n> \n> This issue only appears if the route starts with ~\n> \n> e.g.\n> \n> ``` c#\n> app.MapGet(\"/x~health\", () => Results.Ok(\"Works\"));\n> ````\n> \n> would work</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Add a `RoutePattern` field to the `ApiDescription` type.\n> \n> Set the field to the correct value in EndpointMetadataApiDescriptionProvider and DefaultApiDescriptionProvider.\n> \n> Update ApiDescriptionExtensions.MapRelativePathToItemPath to use this new value.\n> \n> Add tests to Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.Tests to validate the behavior when the `/~health` route is used on an endpoint.</agent_instructions>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> <comment_new><author>@captainsafia</author><body>\n> @dp-sgr Great bug report!

For controller route parameters (including those coming from `[Route]` on the controller or inherited controllers), `ModelMetadata` can be `null`, which caused a `NullReferenceException` in the generated XML comment operation transformer while trying to inspect `metadata.MetadataKind`.\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n\r\n* Updates the emitted transformer code to guard against `null` before checking `MetadataKind` and other members:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar metadata = parameterDescription.ModelMetadata;\r\nif (metadata is not null\r\n    && metadata.MetadataKind == ModelMetadataKind.Property\r\n    && metadata.ContainerType is { } containerType\r\n    && metadata.PropertyName is { } propertyName)\r\n{\r\n    // existing logic to look up XML comments\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Regenerates the corresponding source-generator snapshots so the emitted code matches the new null-check.\r\n* Adds a new controller-based test (`SupportsRouteParametersFromControllers`) that verifies:\r\n  * A controller route parameter defined via `[Route(\"[controller]\")]` and `[HttpGet(\"{userId}\")]` does not throw during OpenAPI document generation.\r\n  * The XML `<summary>` on the route parameter is correctly applied to the OpenAPI parameter description in the generated document.\r\n\r\nFixes #64185\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, apps that:\r\n\r\n* Use controllers with route parameters supplied via `[Route]` on the controller (common in versioned APIs), and  \r\n* Enable XML documentation-based OpenAPI support via `AddOpenApi`,\r\n\r\nwill see OpenAPI document generation fail with a `NullReferenceException` when hitting their OpenAPI endpoint or UI. This prevents customers from using the built-in OpenAPI + XML comments experience in affected controller scenarios and can break development and diagnostics workflows that depend on the generated spec.\r\n\r\nWith this fix:\r\n\r\n* OpenAPI document generation no longer throws when `ModelMetadata` is `null` for a parameter.\r\n* XML comments are still applied where metadata is available.\r\n* There are no behavior changes for parameters that already had non-null `ModelMetadata`.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes  \r\n- [x] No  \r\n\r\nThis is a bug in the new XML documentation–backed OpenAPI support introduced in .NET 10; there wasn’t a previously working version of this feature for this specific scenario.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [ ] High  \r\n- [ ] Medium  \r\n- [x] Low  \r\n\r\nThe change is limited to:\r\n\r\n* Adding a null check before accessing `ModelMetadata` in the generated XML comment transformers.\r\n* Updating source-generator snapshots and adding a focused test.\r\n\r\nIf `ModelMetadata` is non-null, behavior is unchanged. When it is null (previously a hard crash), the transformer now simply skips property-based XML comment lookup for that parameter, which is a safe and expected fallback. The change is localized to OpenAPI XML comment handling and does not affect other MVC or OpenAPI paths.\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\n- [X] Manual (required)  \r\n- [x] Automated  \r\n\r\n## Packaging changes reviewed?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes  \r\n- [ ] No  \r\n- [x] N/A  ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64401","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/10.0] Fix ModelMetadata null reference exception in emitted XMLComment transformers\" (#64401)"},{"Id":"3635324007","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-17T22:32:00","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"64405","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build from source instructions need to be updated for VS 2026","State":"open","Body":"Instructions here: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/BuildFromSource.md\n\nSpecifically, the [InstallVisualStudio.ps1](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/eng/scripts/InstallVisualStudio.ps1) script needs to be updated to support 2026.

Current behavior shows reconnection UI requiring manual page reload, regressing from .NET 9's automatic reload.\n\n**Changes:**\n\n- **DefaultReconnectDisplay.ts**: Renamed `reloadButton` → `retryButton` for consistency with button text\n- **UserSpecifiedDisplay.ts**: Track `remote` property and include it in `resume-failed` events\n- **ReconnectModal.razor.js**: Auto-reload on `resume-failed` when `remote === true`, indicating server-initiated pause\n\n**Flow:**\n\nServer restart → reconnect fails → resume attempted with `remote: true` → resume fails → `resume-failed` event fires with `remote: true` → page reloads automatically\n\nRestores .NET 9 behavior for local development scenarios.\n\nFixes #64228\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> Create a simplified PR from https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64290 that doesn't include the `graceful` changes and that only contains the fixes in fce84180916dec72cee64b04338ec50dcee02adc and where this change\n>     `} else if (event.detail.state === \"rejected\" || (event.detail.state === \"resume-failed\" && !!event.detail.graceful)) {` checks for the `.remote` property (remote == true) instead\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 We'd love your input!

restore behaviour that originally worked with CSS files","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe CSS bundle appears to exist and load, but the browser does not apply the styles. If the same rules are applied to an inline style or a global stylesheet (site.css), the styles work.\n\nThis setup worked earlier in the same project and stopped working while fixing other bugs. I have not been able to restore the previous behaviour.  When creating a new project, they will work as well.  \n\nEnvironment\n\n-   .NET: 10.0 (Blazor United style project)\n-   Rendering: Interactive server\n-   Browser: Microsoft Edge (and others, same result)\n-   Project: Blazor app with isolated CSS (Component.razor + Component.razor.css)\n\nProgram.cs (simplified)\n\n```\nif (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())\n{\n    app.UseStaticFiles();\n}\nelse\n{\n    app.MapStaticAssets();\n}\n\napp.MapStaticAssets();\n\napp.MapRazorComponents<App>()\n   .AddInteractiveServerRenderMode();\n```\n\nRepro steps\n\n1.  Create a Blazor United project on .NET 10.\n2.  Add a component with isolated CSS, for example:\n    1.  Home.razor\n    2.  Home.razor.css\n3.  Run the app in Development.\n4.  Open the page that uses Home.razor.\n5.  Inspect the page in devtools.\n    1.  The scoped CSS bundle appears present in the project output.\n    2.  The CSS file seems to load.\n6.  The component renders without the expected isolated styles.\n7.  Move the same CSS rules from Home.razor.css into:\n    1.  Inline style on the element, or\n    2.  A global stylesheet (site.css).\n8.  Reload the page.\n9.  Styles now apply as expected.\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected behavior\n\n-   Isolated CSS (Component.razor.css) should apply to the matching component when the page loads, both in Development and Production.\n-   If the CSS file loads and the rules are valid, the component should render with the isolated styles, without requiring inline or global CSS as a workaround.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.  Create a Blazor United project on .NET 10.\n2.  Add a component with isolated CSS, for example:\n    1.  Home.razor\n    2.  Home.razor.css\n3.  Run the app in Development.\n4.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

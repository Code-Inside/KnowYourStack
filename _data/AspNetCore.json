I'm trying to create a page that uses a VideoJS player, and noticed that VideoJS instances were persisting across pages whilst navigating the Blazor application - this can be seen in the demo by clicking \"Video (without dispose)\" and then clicking \"Home\" again.\r\n\r\nDiving into the VideoJS documentation, I found the following note:\r\n\r\n> No matter the term used for it, web applications are becoming common. Not everything is a static, load-once-and-done web page anymore! This means that developers need to be able to manage the full lifecycle of a video player - from creation to destruction. Video.js supports player removal through the dispose() method.\r\n\r\nAh! So I need to dispose of the player! \r\n\r\nI looked for a Razor component lifecycle event that would let me hook into when the component gets unloaded but found none. I then discovered that IDisposable/IAsyncDisposable is supported, so hooked into this to call the `dispose()` method of videojs via JS interop. This scenario is what produces the exception that this report covers.\r\n\r\nSo this is where I'm at: either I don't call `dispose()` on the videojs player via JS interop, in which case the videojs instance persists across pages. Or I do call `dispose()` via JS Interop from the component's `Dispose()` method, which throws an exception.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42065","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor WASM] Cannot read properties of null (reading 'removeChild')\" (#42065)"},{"Id":"1262534519","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-06T23:20:01","Actor":"MichelJansson","Number":"42064","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor WASM] InputSelect: binding no longer works with negative numbers","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nData binding to an html input `<input @bind=\"xyz\">` OR `<InputSelect @bind-Value=\"xyz\">` no longer works with negative numbers (`-1`).

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nToday, when a proxy like YARP tries to shut down when a backend is handling a long running connection like those belonging to SignalR or gRPC, it invariably runs into the [now 30 second](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/63712) Host `ShutdownTimeout`. That's because the backend has no way to observe that the proxy (or really any client) is trying to gracefully close the connection at the app layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nKestrel should trigger `IConnectionLifetimeNotificationFeature.ConnectionClosedRequested` when it receives an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 GOAWAY frame requesting a graceful shutdown. This will allow frameworks like SignalR and gRPC to react to clients and proxies like YARP shutting down and trying to gracefully close the connection. We already trigger this during server shutdown and SignalR already hooks this feature. Unfortunately, SignalR still primarily uses WebSockets over HTTP/1.1 where this wouldn't help, but that might change very soon with #7801.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nWe have at least one internal customer that had a sev1 outage because YARP did not shutdown as quickly as expected. Long running connections to the backend are a suspected culprit.\r\n\r\nThis could affect the design of #25069 (\"SignalR connections are shutdown directly during graceful shutdowns\") which is more server shutdown focused but should be designed to support any situation where we want to gracefully close a SignalR connection like when the proxy is shutting down.\r\n\r\nFor HTTP/1.1, there's no way to indicate you want to gracefully close an ongoing response. A FIN would immediately close the entire connection. As a quicker hackier fix that might work for all HTTP versions, you could also conceive of a privileged endpoint that only YARP can access similar to a healthcheck that tells the backend to restart when Kestrel shuts down.

This happens on reading some properties (because it's lazily evaluated). \r\n\r\nInstead, we should handle this case by throwing an exception saying that there was concurrent modification.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example that illustrates why there's a null ref:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n\r\nvar references = new Reference<ReferenceHolder>();\r\n\r\nvar myfeature = references.Fetch(ref references.Cache.NameFeature, () => new MyNameRequestFeature { Name = \"New Feature\" });\r\n\r\n// This blows up with a null ref\r\nvar name = myfeature.Name;\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(name);\r\n\r\nstruct Reference<T>\r\n{\r\n    public T? Cache;\r\n\r\n    public R Fetch<R>(ref R? item, Func<R> factory)\r\n    {\r\n        item = factory();\r\n\r\n        // Clear the cache\r\n        Cache = default;\r\n\r\n        return item;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct ReferenceHolder\r\n{\r\n    public MyNameRequestFeature?

This is nonsensical, as `MaybeNullWhen` will tell the compiler that a value might be null even if the type disallows it. Since `value` has type `string?`, the attribute does nothing. This causes an annoying issue where the compiler will think that the returned value can be null even if a null-check has been performed using the return value of `TryGetValue()`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39844191/171971117-b023f8eb-fbc4-4ce8-9f13-b35b39986e18.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #42032\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/42033","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix IRequestCookieCollection.TryGetValue() possible null reference\" (#42033)"},{"Id":"1260555918","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-04T01:16:21","Actor":"Visne","Number":"42032","RawContent":null,"Title":"IRequestCookieCollection.TryGetValue() causes \"Possible null reference\" even if if-statement and return is used","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nConsider the following code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39844191/171970807-21ce281d-5991-4e7c-8677-ca9552f996a2.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSince the if-statement returns if `TryGetValue()` returns false, the compiler should be aware that the value can not be null.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.102\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI already figured out how to fix this, and will open a PR soon.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42032","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IRequestCookieCollection.TryGetValue() causes \"Possible null reference\" even if if-statement and return is used\" (#42032)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change. Optionally, there are changes to your application that you may consider to work around this change if it impacts your application:\r\n\r\n* [`ActivatorUtilitiesConstructorAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilitiesconstructorattribute) can be applied to constructor to specify an exact constructor to use.\r\n* Application developers may register an implementation of `IComponentActivator` in the DI container that reverts to the .NET 6 behavior.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nComponent constructors","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/482","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default\" (#482)"},{"Id":"1190169916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-01T19:03:58","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"484","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThe mechanism to detect an empty request `body` during the MVC Model Binding now uses the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody), that is currently implemented by the following behavior:\r\n\r\n- `true` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with a non-zero `Content-Length` or a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that did not set the `END_STREAM` flag on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\n- `false` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with no `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header, or the `Content-Length` is `0`.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with `Connection: Upgrade` (e.g. WebSockets). There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

This is primarily used to support runtime-compilation based scenarios.\r\n\r\nPrior to .NET 6, `PreserveCompilationContext` was configured to `true` for all apps that target the Razor (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor`) and Web (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`) apps.

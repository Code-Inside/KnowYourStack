For example:\n\n```csharp\npublic class CustomFromKeyedServicesAttribute : FromKeyedServicesAttribute\n{\n    public CustomFromKeyedServicesAttribute(object key) : base(key) { }\n}\n\n// This would not be detected by the framework\npublic void MyAction([CustomFromKeyedServices(\"myKey\")] IMyService service) { }\n```\n\n## Solution\n\nEnhanced inheritance checking across all code generation components:\n\n- **MVC Model Binding** (`BindingInfo.cs`) - Ensures derived attributes work in MVC controller actions\n- **HTTP Extensions** (`RequestDelegateFactory.cs`) - Enables derived attributes in minimal API endpoints  \n- **SignalR Core** (`HubMethodDescriptor.cs`) - Supports derived attributes in SignalR hub methods\n- **Request Delegate Generator** (`EndpointParameter.cs`) - Handles derived attributes in source generators\n- **Validation Generator** (`ITypeSymbolExtensions.cs`) - Detects derived attributes during compilation\n\n## Infrastructure Changes\n\nAdded robust inheritance checking methods to `SymbolExtensions.cs`:\n- `InheritsFrom()` - Checks if a type inherits from a base class\n- `TryGetAttributeInheritingFrom()` - Finds attributes that derive from a base type\n\n## Changes Made\n\n1. **BindingInfo.cs**: Updated attribute detection to use `typeof(FromKeyedServicesAttribute).IsAssignableFrom(a.GetType())`\n2. **RequestDelegateFactory.cs**: Fixed two locations using similar inheritance-aware checks  \n3. **HubMethodDescriptor.cs**: Enhanced pattern matching to handle derived types\n4. **EndpointParameter.cs**: Replaced `TryGetAttribute` with `TryGetAttributeInheritingFrom` for inheritance support\n5. **ITypeSymbolExtensions.cs**: Updated `IsServiceParameter` to use `InheritsFrom` instead of exact equality\n6. **Added comprehensive test**: `SupportsDerivedFromKeyedServicesAttribute` validates the fix end-to-end\n\n## Testing\n\n- All existing tests continue to pass\n- New test confirms derived attributes are properly detected across all components\n- Comprehensive validation across MVC, HTTP Extensions, Request Delegate Generators, and Validation generators\n- No breaking changes to existing functionality\n\nThis enables developers to create extensible service injection attributes while maintaining full backward compatibility and framework support.\n\nFixes #63113.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

It does not have to be a list, an array or `IEnumerable` also leads to the same result.\n\nAs a concrete example take `public record Balance(List<BalanceEntry> Assets, List<BalanceEntry> Liabilities);` in the following program.cs file, you can also find this same file [in this repository](https://github.com/BorisGerretzen/OpenApiIdenticalListIssue).\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpResults;\n\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenApi();\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\napp.MapOpenApi();\napp.MapGet(\"/balance\", GetBalance);\napp.Run();\n\nreturn;\n\nOk<Balance> GetBalance()\n{\n    var balance = new Balance(\n        [\n            new BalanceEntry(\"Cash\", 1000),\n            new BalanceEntry(\"Stocks\", 4000)\n        ],\n        [\n            new BalanceEntry(\"Credit Card\", 2000),\n            new BalanceEntry(\"Loan\", 3000)\n        ]\n    );\n\n    return TypedResults.Ok(balance);\n}\n\npublic record BalanceEntry(string AccountName, decimal Amount);\n\npublic record Balance(List<BalanceEntry> Assets, List<BalanceEntry> Liabilities);\n```\n\nIn the generated OpenApi document I get the following, as you can see there is no `$ref` for liabilities.\n```json\n      \"Balance\": {\n        \"required\": [\n          \"assets\",\n          \"liabilities\"\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"assets\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/BalanceEntry\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"liabilities\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": { }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n```\nIn this example I use `TypedResults` but if you remove that and return the `Balance` object directly the issue is still there.\nThis issue occurs when using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` version `9.0.7`. `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen` version `9.0.3` does not have this issue.\n\nI asked this question on [StackOverflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79719869/microsoft-aspnetcore-openapi-does-not-generate-type-reference-for-identical-list) as well but I did not get any replies.\n\n[Generated OpenApi document](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21576840/v1.json)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBoth lists should get the `$ref` attribute.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nYou can find a small project that exhibits this problem [here](https://github.com/BorisGerretzen/OpenApiIdenticalListIssue). Run the project and navigate to `http://localhost:5045/openapi/v1.json`.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.300\n\n### Anything else?\n\n| Item | Version |\n| --- |

Third-party UI component libraries (e.g., Blazorise, MudBlazor) cannot participate in this system because:\n\n- CSS isolation is processed at build time.\n- Scoped attributes (e.g., `b-12ab34cd`) are automatically added only to components compiled with the application.\n- Third-party components are precompiled, preventing the Razor compiler from injecting the scoped attribute into their rendered elements.\n\nThis proposal introduces a new framework-supported attribute, `blazor-css-scope`, allowing third-party components to opt-in to CSS isolation. It would let application authors style third-party components using isolated `.razor.css` files without relying on global styles.\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nWhen using a third-party component:\n\n```razor\n<MyVendor.Button Text=\"Click me\" />\n```\n\nand defining isolated styles in `Parent.razor.css`\n\n```css\n.vendor-button {\n    background: red;\n}\n```\n\nBlazor transforms this into:\n\n```css\n.vendor-button[b-12ab34cd] {\n    background: red;\n}\n```\n\nBut because the vendor’s component cannot know or emit the `b-12ab34cd `attribute, the style does not apply.\n\n## Proposed Behavior\n\nWith the new feature:\n\n1. The compiler exposes the generated CSS scope ID (`b-12ab34cd`) as a built-in parameter or cascading value.\n2. Third-party components can bind this ID to a new attribute:\n\n  ```\n  <button class=\"vendor-button\" blazor-css-scope=\"b-12ab34cd\">Click me</button>\n  ```\n\n3. The isolated CSS selector matches, allowing scoped styling of third-party components.\n\n## Specification\n\n### 1. New Attribute Name\n\n- Proposed name: `blazor-css-scope`\n- Purpose: Indicates a component’s association with a scoped CSS ID generated by Blazor’s compiler.\n\n### 2. Compiler Changes\n\n- The compiler should:\n  - Generate a `CssScopeId` (string) for each Razor component that uses CSS isolation.\n  - Provide this ID as a special built-in parameter or cascading value to child components.\n\nExample:\n\n```razor\n<MyVendor.Button CssScopeId=\"@this.CssScopeId\" />\n```\n\n### 3. Third-Party Component Usage\n\n- Vendors add a parameter to their component:\n\n```cs\n[Parameter] public string? CssScopeId { get; set; }\n```\n\n- Render it on the root element:\n\n```cs\n<button class=\"vendor-button\" blazor-css-scope=\"@CssScopeId\">@Text</button>\n```\n\n### 4. Backward Compatibility\n\n- Existing CSS isolation behavior remains unchanged.\n- If a vendor doesn’t implement the attribute, there’s no impact.\n- Purely additive, opt-in feature.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Allows isolated `.razor.css` files to style third-party components.\n- Preserves encapsulation and avoids global CSS overrides.\n- Simple for vendors to implement and propagate within their libraries.\n- No breaking changes for existing projects.\n\n## Challenges & Considerations\n\n- **Nested Components:** Vendors must propagate the scope attribute through their internal components if they want full coverage.\n- **Multiple Parents:** Need clear rules for determining which scope ID applies (default to the immediate parent).\n- **Performance:** Minimal, adding an attribute is low cost.\n\n## Alternatives\n\n- Use global CSS overrides (leads to style conflicts).\n- Ask vendors to ship their own scoped styling (not practical for user customizations).\n- Reflection or hacks to read internal scope ID (unsupported).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdding a framework-supported `blazor-css-scope` attribute would close a major gap in Blazor’s CSS isolation feature, enabling third-party UI libraries to fully integrate with the scoped styling system while maintaining component isolation and theming capabilities.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/63091","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: Enable CSS Isolation Support for Third-Party Components via blazor-css-scope Attribute\" (#63091)"},{"Id":"3288648377","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-04T09:12:35","Actor":"martincostello","Number":"63090","RawContent":null,"Title":"[OpenAPI] Invalid schema references generated","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nTo validate the changes made in #63052 I put the [OpenAPI schema](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/f91de94be74398a75ccc2ddd724e76bf4c051667/src/OpenApi/test/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.Tests/Integration/snapshots/OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant.verified.txt) into [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) to see if the schema for JSON Patch had any validation errors (it does not).\n\nHowever, amongst a few schema errors that are found in the document that aren't just artifacts of testing, I found two that appear to be actual issues:\n\n1. `Semantic error at components.schemas.Category.properties.tags.$ref - $refs must reference a valid location in the document` from https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/f91de94be74398a75ccc2ddd724e76bf4c051667/src/OpenApi/test/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.Tests/Integration/snapshots/OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant.verified.txt#L1362\n2. `Semantic error at components.schemas.Item.properties.name.$ref - $refs must reference a valid location in the document` from https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/f91de94be74398a75ccc2ddd724e76bf4c051667/src/OpenApi/test/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.Tests/Integration/snapshots/OpenApiDocumentLocalizationTests.VerifyOpenApiDocumentIsInvariant.verified.txt#L1427\n\nThese correlate to these parts of the code:\n\n1. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c103a034c4dccb1fecd02f68e4b0a3b638790b0c/src/OpenApi/sample/Endpoints/MapSchemasEndpoints.cs#L51\n2. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c103a034c4dccb1fecd02f68e4b0a3b638790b0c/src/OpenApi/sample/Endpoints/MapSchemasEndpoints.cs#L73\n\nBoth of these properties are arrays and appear to generate a circular reference to themselves via another object.\n\n1.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want to always redirect to the login and access denied URIs for unauthenticated or unauthorized requests regardless of the target endpoint or whether the source of the request is an XHR, you can override the `RedirectToLogin` and `RedirectToAccessDenied` as follows:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\nIf you want to revert to the exact previous behavior which avoids redirecting for only XHRs, you can override the events with this slightly more complicated logic:\n\n<details><summary>Fully backwards compatible events</summary>\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n</details>\n\n### References\n\nIssue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039\nPR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62816\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Metadata.IApiEndpointMetadata`\n- [CookieAuthenticationEvents.RedirectToLogin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationevents.redirecttologin?view=aspnetcore-9.0)\n- [CookieAuthenticationEvents.RedirectToAccessDenied](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationevents.redirecttoaccessdenied?view=aspnetcore-9.0)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/525","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Cookie login redirects are disabled for known API endpionts\" (#525)"},{"Id":"3268897827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-28T09:05:45","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"524","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler).

An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nNote: In cloud environments, the proxy IP(s) can change over the lifetime of the app and `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` is sometimes used to make forwarded headers work.\n\n### References\n\n- [Forwarded Headers Middleware documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer)\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n`UseForwardedHeaders();`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/517","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Forwarded Headers Middleware Now Ignores X-Forwarded-* Headers from Unknown Proxies\" (#517)"},{"Id":"2662868601","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T18:59:39","Actor":"maraf","Number":"516","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nIn previous versions of Blazor WebAssembly, legacy Mono and Emscripten APIs were exported to global namespace. \r\nFrom 9.0 those APIs are accessible throught Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 9 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nLegacy Mono (MONO, BINDING) and Emscripten Module object was exported to global window object.\r\nFor example `window.Module.FS` returned emscripten virtual filesystem.\n\n### New behavior\n\nEmscripten Module object is now exported to `Blazor.runtime` object.\r\nFor example `Blazor.runtime.Module.FS` returns emscripten virtual filesystem.\r\nLegacy Mono API for interop was removed completely (MONO and BINDING) and replaced with JSImport/JSExport.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe general goal is not to polute global namespace and keep all the APIs accessible from single Blazor object.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nReplace accessing Emscripten APIs from window object to Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nwindow.MONO.*\r\nwindow.BINDING.*\r\nwindow.Module.*","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/516","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications\" (#516)"},{"Id":"2606573022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-22T21:39:01","Actor":"amcasey","Number":"515","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: dev cert export no longer creates folder","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nWhen you export the ASP.NET Core development certificate (used to enable https in local development), it will no longer create the directory into which the certificate is being exported, if that directory doesn’t already exist.\r\n\r\nThis change first appears in 8.0.10 and 9.0 RC1.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 8 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```\r\ndotnet dev-certs https -ep C:\\NonExistent\\cert.pfx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `C:\\NonExistent\\` did not exist when the command was run, it would be created (with permissions inherited from the containing directory).\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe target directory must exist or the export will fail with a message like `There was an error exporting the HTTPS developer certificate to a file.`\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe development certificate is exported with its private key, so unauthorized access can be very problematic.

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

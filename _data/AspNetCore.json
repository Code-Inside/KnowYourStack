which .NET runtime (Server/WebAssembly) is starting?\r\n* In the case of Blazor WebAssembly, should we wait to invoke `beforeStart` until we know for sure that Blazor WebAssembly is starting? Currently, `beforeStart` gets invoked during the Blazor WebAssembly loading procedure, but this doesn't always indicate that Blazor WebAssembly will be used (consider auto mode).\r\n* In the case of Blazor Server, should the `afterStarted` callback run each time a new circuit is created? We plan on closing circuits automatically if all Blazor Server components get removed from the page.\r\n* Should `beforeStart` execute immediately after `Blazor.start()` is called when using `blazor.web.js`? Currently, `beforeStart` only executes just before Blazor WebAssembly or Blazor Server starts up.\r\n  * Or, alternatively, should the module be imported as soon as `Blazor.start()` gets called, but `beforeStart` only gets called when Blazor Server or WebAssembly starts?\r\n* Should we add arguments to the `afterStarted` callback to indicate which .NET runtime started?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50187","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Finalize behavior of JavaScript initializers for Blazor Web apps\" (#50187)"},{"Id":"1856857754","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-18T14:52:06","Actor":"westonwalker","Number":"50185","RawContent":null,"Title":"Give Blazor SSR access to HTTP Context","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

Skipping negotiation will enforce the client to configure only WebSockets(which is fine, I guess). I tried looking for the implications of skipping negotiation but unfortunately, I didn't find concrete answer. If skipping negotiation is not completely recommended solution, **Can we make use of Redis backplane to persist token and validate it in next call?** \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50171","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can we use Redis backplane to persist and read negotiate tokens to avoid sticky sessions in load balanced environment?\" (#50171)"},{"Id":"1855849523","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-17T23:50:36","Actor":"MackinnonBuck","Number":"50170","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Close the circuit when all Blazor Server components are disposed","State":"open","Body":"# [Blazor] Close the circuit when all Blazor Server components are disposed\r\n\r\nOpening initially as a draft.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For example the [OnTokenValidated](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/bf303a1092f83d789031fdafac60f3fc454cfc49/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/JwtBearerEvents.cs#L29) event is fired when a security token is validated. These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT. These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

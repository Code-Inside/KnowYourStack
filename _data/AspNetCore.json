Unfortunately, this API does not have a way to support reading pdbs for assemblies that are not emitted to disk such as runtime compiled Razor Views.

When I create users in dbo.AspNetUsers I populated the Email field with the same value as the UserName field e.g. JoeB. Doing so does not affect the login process but when it comes to triggering Automatic Lockouts for failed login attempts, this feature fails to trigger.\r\n\r\nThe following email addresses won't trigger a Lockout:\r\n\r\n**NULL\r\nJoeB\r\nJoeB@**\r\n\r\nAnything of the form _alphanumberic@alphanumberic_ seems to be OK (e.g. _JoeB@example_).\r\n\r\nTaking a look at the ASP.Net identity source code I think this bug is related to the last method in this call chain:\r\n\r\n-     SignInManager.CheckPasswordSignInAsync()\r\n-       UserManager.AccessFailedAsync(user)\r\n-         UserManager.UpdateUserAsync()\r\n-           UserManager.UpdateNormalizedEmailAsync(user)\r\n\r\nSince the email address doesn't exist or is invalid (according to some internal check?), the UpdateNormalizedEmailAsync(user) fails in some way causing the following record store.IncrementAccessFailedCountAsync(user, CancellationToken) to not be committed to the database.\r\n\r\nRunning SQL Profiler confirms that the SQL to update dbo.AspNetUsers.AccessFailedCount is never sent to the database if the email address is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis behavior may be by design (for reasons not obvious to me) but I've wasted many hours wrestling with this issue so I though I would log it here in case anyone else gets tripped up by it.\r\n\r\nP.S. The ApplicationManager.SupportsUserEmail is read-only so I can't use this to signal that Email address is not relevant."},{"Id":"7361636132","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-11T10:11:41","Actor":"MonaLarsen","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1674","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"AggregateException occurs after converting User Id to int in ApplicationUser/ApplicationRole\" (#1674) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"By following this tutorial [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-primary-key-configuration?tabs=aspnetcore2x) I got to succesfully convert the User Id to int so i can use Linq with operations done on users in my application.\r\n\r\nEverything worked fine here, but after creating default users in startup.cs like this:\r\n\r\n`    public async Task CreateUsersAndRoles(IServiceScope serviceScope)\r\n        {\r\n            var userManager = serviceScope.ServiceProvider.GetService<UserManager<ApplicationUser>>();\r\n            var roleManager = serviceScope.ServiceProvider.GetService<RoleManager<IdentityRole>>();\r\n\r\n            //Creating Admin role\r\n            await roleManager.CreateAsync(new IdentityRole(\"TopUser\"));\r\n            var TopUsers = new ApplicationUser { UserName = \"xxxxx@xx.com\", \r\n                                                  Email = \"xxx@xxxx.com\",  \r\n                                                  };\r\n\r\n\r\n            await userManager.CreateAsync(adminUser, \"xxxxxx\");\r\n            await userManager.AddToRoleAsync(TopUsers, \"TopUser\");\r\n\r\n}`\r\n\r\ni am getting an error in ` CreateUsersAndRoles(serviceScope).Wait();` that is not clear and i don't know why the compiling is failing as eveything seems to be logically working.\r\n\r\nHere is the error: `An exception of type 'System.AggregateException' occurred in System.Private.CoreLib.dll but was not handled in user code: 'One or more errors occurred.'

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where, if an application is hosted behind Internet Information Server (IIS) a remote unauthenticated attacker can use a specially crafted request can cause a Denial of Service.\r\n\r\n## Dicussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/IISIntegration/issues/658\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nAny site hosted behind a different proxy, such as nginx or an application hosted in Azure, which uses Application Request Routing (ARR) as a proxy is not affected. \r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft ASP.NET Core project if it is hosted behind an IIS server running AspNetCoreModule (ANCM) prior to 7.1.1990.0.\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected? \r\n\r\nOpen a PowerShell prompt and run the following command\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(Get-Item $env:SystemDrive\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\aspnetcore.dll).VersionInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\nor use the Windows file properties dialog to check the version on `C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\aspnetcore.dll`, where C: is your OS install drive.\r\n\r\nIf the file version is less than 7.1.1990.0 you are affected.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue? \r\nInstall the latest version of the ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle \r\n(You need only install a single version, i.e. installing Version 2.0 will protect Version 1.0/1.1 .NET Core applications and vice versa. Choose the one that corresponds to the highest runtime version on your server).\r\n\r\n* [Hosting Bundle for ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869677)\r\n* [Hosting Bundle for ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869674)\r\n\r\nThen restart IIS by running \r\n\r\n```\r\nnet stop was /y\r\nnet start w3svc\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom an elevated command line.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These images will continue to receive patch update whenever a 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x update ships, however, we will not produce a new version which contains the 2.1 runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n \r\nThese images existed to support CI/CD pipelines that run apps on multiple versions for .NET Core in the same container. With each release, these images have grown in size. The 1.0-2.0 image is already about 1GB, and would continue to grow with runtime updates. \r\n \r\nFortunately, recent improvements to .NET Core (such as minor version roll-forward) and Docker (multi-stage builds) have reduced the need to use an image with multiple versions of .NET Core. We have seen usage of these multi-version images declining over time, and today, they are a small percentage of our Docker image usage.\r\n\r\nRather than maintaining a single, large image with all possible .NET Core runtimes, we encourage users to use multi-stage builds. Docker's multi-stage feature allows you to compose a single Dockerfile, but still use multiple .NET Core runtimes. Also, starting in 2.1, .NET Core supports rolling forward the runtime version within the major version, which will further reduce the need to have multiple 2.x runtimes side-by-side.\r\n \r\nFor discussion, use https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/349"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"973691520728510464","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T22:45:23+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now... join us for the weekly #ASPNET Community Standup at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":3,"FavoriteCount":9,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"973553523186159621","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T13:37:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Today, Jeff shows you how to use dependency injection with web forms... check it out! https://t.co/viqZ28DBrV","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":22,"FavoriteCount":7,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"973350716046626816","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T00:11:09+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join us for the weekly #ASPNET Community Standup this Tuesday at 3:45 PM Pacific / 23:45 GMT at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":5,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"972484011556818945","CreatedAt":"2018-03-10T14:47:10+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Be sure to check out Jeff's live coding stream this morning to see more about our #ASP.NET Core 2.1 preview release. https://t.co/EtKk0fMOgU","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":24,"FavoriteCount":10,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"971084152693866496","CreatedAt":"2018-03-06T18:04:38+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"We are live at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2 !

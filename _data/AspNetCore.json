Please describe the problem.\n\nYes. When building APIs that accept complex objects along with file uploads, developers often face the need to support both `application/json` and `multipart/form-data`. ASP.NET Core currently does not offer a unified, first-class way to bind from both content types into a single model. As a result, developers end up writing manual parsing logic inside controller actions, leading to boilerplate code and duplication across endpoints.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA built-in, generic model binder (`FromFormOrJsonModelBinder<T>`) that allows developers to seamlessly bind a model from either `application/json` or `multipart/form-data`, with optional support for file injection into the model (via an interface like `IFormFileReceiver`).\n\nThis would be exposed via a `[FromFormOrJson]` attribute and integrated using a custom `IModelBinderProvider`.\n\nThe solution is designed to be extensible, unobtrusive, and to fit naturally into the existing ASP.NET Core model binding pipeline.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI’ve implemented a working prototype with full unit tests and an extensibility point for models to optionally receive uploaded files. The binder automatically detects the content type, parses the payload accordingly, and applies deserialization with `System.Text.Json`.\n\nThis is a common need in modern APIs, and having it supported natively would improve developer productivity and reduce error-prone boilerplate in real-world scenarios like mobile backends and admin panel APIs.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61856","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"📝 Issue: Native model binding support for mixed multipart/form-data and JSON payloads\" (#61856)"},{"Id":"3053212738","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-09T21:18:25","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"61860","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use Microsoft.NETCore.App.Ref version in place of legacy MicrosoftNETCoreAppPackageVersion","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/repo-projects/Directory.Build.props#L247-L251\r\n\r\nThe reason for this block is that repos tend to use arch specific version properties as proxy version numbers. So aspnetcore will set the runtime pack version based on the MicrosoftNETCoreAppVersion, which it typically sets based on the x64 runtime pack version. But since that's not produced in an x86 build, we jump some through VMR hoops to get this right. The stabilized build exposes a few of these cases where we incorrectly use a few properties, which is quite fixable, but overall this block caught my attention and I think we should remove it. aspnetcore seems to be the biggest user of MicrosoftNETCoreAppVersion, set to the x64 runtime pack version. I was thinking to just changing all the uses to the ref pack version, since the runtime pack and ref pack versions are always aligned. We can then get rid of this block altogether, which would be great.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/61860","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Use Microsoft.NETCore.App.Ref version in

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?   I am following the code here even though we have normal MVC and not razor pages like you have in the example.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

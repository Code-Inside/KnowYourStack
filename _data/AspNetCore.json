We prefer this file is not touched or edited at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe Application Settings in Azure, is a great way for that team to manage settings against change control requests. The issue currently is that when a change is made here, the application must be restarted so that the change can take affect.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where, if an application is hosted behind Internet Information Server (IIS) a remote unauthenticated attacker can use a specially crafted request can cause a Denial of Service.\r\n\r\n## Dicussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/IISIntegration/issues/658\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nAny site hosted behind a different proxy, such as nginx or an application hosted in Azure, which uses Application Request Routing (ARR) as a proxy is not affected. \r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft ASP.NET Core project if it is hosted behind an IIS server running AspNetCoreModule (ANCM) prior to 7.1.1990.0.\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected? \r\n\r\nOpen a PowerShell prompt and run the following command\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(Get-Item $env:SystemDrive\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\aspnetcore.dll).VersionInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\nor use the Windows file properties dialog to check the version on `C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\aspnetcore.dll`, where C: is your OS install drive.\r\n\r\nIf the file version is less than 7.1.1990.0 you are affected.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue? \r\nInstall the latest version of the ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle \r\n(You need only install a single version, i.e. installing Version 2.0 will protect Version 1.0/1.1 .NET Core applications and vice versa. Choose the one that corresponds to the highest runtime version on your server).\r\n\r\n* [Hosting Bundle for ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869677)\r\n* [Hosting Bundle for ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869674)\r\n\r\nThen restart IIS by running \r\n\r\n```\r\nnet stop was /y\r\nnet start w3svc\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom an elevated command line.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including Terms and Conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations. These are located at https://github.com/dotnet/ and https://github.com/aspnet/. The Announcements repo for each product (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements and https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\t\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nThe information provided in this advisory is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.

there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nI need to add a regex in ``UsePathBase``, I want to culture the entire URL\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI am using blazor server side.\r\n\r\nI currently have something like this:\r\n```\r\n            app.UsePathBase(\"/pl\");\r\n            app.UsePathBase(\"/pl-pl\");\r\n            app.UsePathBase(\"/en\");\r\n            app.UsePathBase(\"/en-us\");\r\n            app.UsePathBase(\"/de\");\r\n            app.UsePathBase(\"/it\");\r\n```\r\nNeed:\r\n```\r\napp.UsePathBase(\"/{culture:regex(^[a-zA-Z]{{2}}(-[a-zA-Z+]{{2}})?$)}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates many problems but solves the one I care about. Thanks to this, we can have a culture in each URL. e.g:\r\n``domain.com/en-us/register``\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n\r\n                endpoints.MapGet(\"/{culture:regex(^[a-zA-Z]{{2}}(-[a-zA-Z+]{{2}})?$)=pl}/{**rest}\", async context =>\r\n                {\r\n                    var culture = context.Request.RouteValues[\"culture\"] ?? _website.Culture;\r\n                    var rest = context.Request.RouteValues[\"rest\"];\r\n\r\n                    var option = new CookieOptions\r\n                    {\r\n                        Expires = DateTime.Now.AddYears(1)\r\n                    };\r\n                    context.Response.Cookies.Append(\"Culture\", culture.ToString() ?? \"\", option);\r\n                    await Task.CompletedTask;\r\n                });\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when we use ``PathBase``, this request will not be performed and it will not save the cookie culture. Do you have an idea how to do it?\r\n\r\nThe effect I want to get is written here:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/38584#issuecomment-976637332\r\n\r\nThe problem of using ``app.UsePathBase`` is that a value is added to ``<base href = \"~ /\" />``, so we need to change to ``<base href = \"/\" />``\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, in short I need to be able to prefix in the url. I need to support the culture as in the example in the link above.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40959","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"UsePathBase regex\" (#40959)"},{"Id":"1185832676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-30T18:18:29","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"40947","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update spa-templates to latest commit","State":"closed","Body":"Completes #40917\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/40947","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update spa-templates to latest commit\" (#40947)"},{"Id":"1186700437","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-30T16:22:31","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"40957","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hosting Bundle uninstall should uninstall underlying runtimes","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nRight now, if you install the hosting bundle on a clean machine, then uninstall it, it'll leave behind the dotnet & asp.net runtimes.

As for compatibility I made sure I didn't install a singalR nuget library by mistake on the SUT, and verified I am using the correct client on my test app. PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client\" Version=\"6.0.3\". I am writing an integration test and previously it was working, so I know that my factory is correctly creating the web API in memory and I verified it was successfully executing a POST call. I made sure in Startup I have services.AddSignalR(); and that the hub was mapped at the endpoints. Below is the code I introduced into the arrange section of the previously working integration test. I simply want to detect if the SingalR event is firing when a web API url post is called.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

This experience is going to focus on decoupling the frontend from the backend into two separate projects. For details here.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

Optionally, captured the new returned `IDisposable` and dispose it if you later wish to undo the effects of the call.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.AddDataAnnotationsValidation(EditContext)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.forms.editcontextdataannotationsextensions.adddataannotationsvalidation?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/458","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation\" (#458)"},{"Id":"848690041","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T18:24:35","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"457","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Java Client updated to RxJava3","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis issue template is for use in opening issues that document breaking changes.

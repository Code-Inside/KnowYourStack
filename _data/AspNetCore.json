Please describe the problem.\n\n## 1  Problem Statement\n\nBlazor Server currently routes every browser⇄server interaction through a single SignalR WebSocket. When a Blazor component needs to exchange **very large messages**—e.g., 18 MB OmniSharp completion lists or multi‑MB file uploads—the socket is monopolized, freezing the UI.\n\n- **Large messages stall the circuit**  \n    The OmniSharp `completionItems` response can exceed 18 MB. While that payload moves, no other WebSocket messages can be processed, making the IDE appear frozen. Large file uploads cause the same problem.\n    \n- **Extra plumbing required**  \n    Avoiding this requires building bespoke REST APIs or gRPC services and duplicating auth, model binding, and serialization logic—breaking the smooth “stay in Blazor land” workflow.\n    \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n\n## 2  Proposed Solution\n\nThis proposal introduces an **opt‑in HTTP POST interop API** that lets JavaScript call arbitrary .NET instance methods _in parallel_ to the SignalR channel, keeping the UI responsive without forcing developers to create separate API endpoints.\n\nIntroduce a _secondary_ transport for JS interop:\n\n```text\nwindow.dotnet.invokeHttpAsync(methodIdentifier, arg1, arg2, ...)\n                       ↧\nPOST /_blazor/interop\n  { circuitId: \"12341234\", instanceId: \"45674567\", method: \"GetCompletions\", args: [ ... ] }\n                       ↧\nServer invokes the instance method (scoped to circuit)\n                       ↧\nHTTP 200 + JSON‑serialized result\n```\n\n- **Transport**  Standard HTTP POST with a JSON body.\n    \n- **Auth**  Leverages existing cookie (or token) auth; same policies as the circuit.\n    \n- **Concurrency**  Requests are independent and can run in parallel; no ordering guarantees (unlike SignalR).\n    \n- **Circuit context**  Requests carry the circuit ID header, so `IJSRuntime`, `HttpContext`, DI scopes, etc., behave as expected.\n    \n\n## 3  Benefits\n\n\n- 🚀 **Responsive UI:** Big payloads no longer block SignalR; rendering stays snappy.\n\n- 🧩 **Single mental model:** Developers stay within the familiar JS‑interop pattern, no separate controllers, minimal APIs or gRPC services for edge cases.\n\n- ⚡ **Awaitable results:** `invokeHttpAsync` returns a Promise resolved with the deserialized C# - result.\n\n- 🔌 **Opt‑in:** Existing apps keep current behavior; only calls that _choose_ HTTP use it.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Limitations & Considerations\n\n- **Out‑of‑order delivery**  This is _desirable_ for high‑bandwidth tasks but differs from SignalR’s ordered guarantees.\n    \n- **Only `POST` initially**  `GET`, streaming, or custom media types can come later.\n    \n- **Security**  Requires an explicit attribute (e.g., `[JSInvokable(Http = true)]`) to opt in per method.\n    \n- **Circuit lifetime**  If the circuit dies mid‑request, the HTTP call should return 409/410 so the client can retry or display an error.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 5 Proposed API Surface\n\n```csharp\n// C#\npublic class CompletionService\n{\n    [JSInvokable(Http = true)]\n    public async Task<CompletionResult> GetCompletions(string code, int position)\n        => ...;\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// JavaScript\nconst result = await DotNet.invokeHttpAsync(\n    \"CompletionService.GetCompletions\",\n    code, \n    cursorPos\n);\n// result is already parsed JSON\n```\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n```js\nDotNet.invokeHttpAsync(method, args, {\n    signal: abortController.signal, // cancellation\n    headers: { \"x-custom\": \"foo\" } // extra headers\n});\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n## 6  Request for Feedback\n\n- **API shape:** `invokeHttpAsync` vs. `invokeViaHttp`?\n    \n- **Attribute contract:**  simple `[JSInvokable(Http = true)]` or a dedicated `[HttpInvokable]`?\n    \n- **Streaming:**  should we add `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` support in v1?\n    \n- **Error handling:** HTTP status codes ↔ JS exceptions mapping.\n\n- **Custom Authentication:** HTTP request might require some customization for authentication from JS.    \n\n- Have you ever thought about this feature or found yourself having to create APIs to call component methods?\n\n- Could this be usefull for SSR?\n\n---\n\n## 7  Next Steps\n\nIf the team is interested, I’m happy to try to submit a **PR** with a clean, reflection‑free implementation. But I might need help.\n\n\n---\n\n> **Bottom line:** An HTTP‑based interop path solves a real pain point for Blazor Server apps dealing with huge payloads—without forcing developers to abandon the elegant JS‑interop model. I’d love your thoughts and guidance on making this a first‑class feature! \n\n---\n\n\n## 8  Proof of Concept\n\nI have successfully developed a reflection‑based PoC that solves all the problems stated:\n\n1. Registers an minimal API endpoint.\n    \n2. In it, it resolves the target component from the CircuitRegistry.\n    \n3. Deserializes `args[]`, invokes the method using InvokeAsync, serializes the return value, and streams it back.\n    \nIn production we’d replace reflection with official hooks.\n\n\n\n```js\nwindow.invokeDotNetObjectViaHttp = async (dotNetInstance, methodName, ...argsArray ) => {\n\n    const circuitId = dotNetInstance._callDispatcher._dotNetCallDispatcher._circuitId; \n    const dotNetObjectId = dotNetInstance._id;  \n    const assemblyName = null;    \n    const methodName2 = methodName;    \n    const callId = crypto.randomUUID();         \n\n    return invokeDotNetViaHttp(\n        circuitId,\n        dotNetObjectId,\n        assemblyName,\n        methodName2,\n        callId,\n        argsArray\n    );\n}\n\nwindow.invokeDotNetViaHttp = async (\n    circuitId,\n    dotNetObjectId,\n    assemblyName,\n    methodName,\n    callId,\n    argsArray\n) => {\n    const url = `/api/blazorinterop/${encodeURIComponent(circuitId)}/${dotNetObjectId}/${encodeURIComponent(assemblyName)}/${encodeURIComponent(methodName)}/${encodeURIComponent(callId)}`;\n\n    const response = await fetch(url, {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n        body: JSON.stringify(argsArray),\n    });\n\n    if (!response.ok) {\n        const errorText = await response.text();\n        throw new Error(`Server returned ${response.status}: ${errorText}`);\n    }\n\n    const text = await response.text();\n    return text ? JSON.parse(text) : undefined;\n}\n\n// somwhere in a js interop call..\nconst response = await window.invokeDotNetObjectViaHttp(_dotNetInstance, \"GetCompletionAsync\", code, request, filterKind, filterParametersOnly )\n\n\n```\n\n\n```csharp\n\n\ninternal static class CircuitInterop\n{\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<Type> CircuitRegistryType = new( () =>\n        Type.GetType( \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.Circuits.CircuitRegistry, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server\" )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"CircuitRegistry type not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<PropertyInfo> ConnectedCircuitsProp = new( () =>\n        CircuitRegistryType.Value.GetProperty( \"ConnectedCircuits\", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"ConnectedCircuits property not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<PropertyInfo> KeysProp = new( () =>\n        ConnectedCircuitsProp.Value.PropertyType.GetProperty( \"Keys\" )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"Keys property not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<MethodInfo> TryGetValueMI = new( () =>\n        ConnectedCircuitsProp.Value.PropertyType.GetMethod( \"TryGetValue\" )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"TryGetValue method not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<Type> CircuitIdType = new( () =>\n        CircuitRegistryType.Value.Assembly.GetType( \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.Circuits.CircuitId\" )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"CircuitId type not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<PropertyInfo> SecretProp = new( () =>\n        CircuitIdType.Value.GetProperty( \"Secret\", BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"CircuitId.Secret property not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<Type> CircuitHostType = new( () =>\n        CircuitRegistryType.Value.Assembly.GetType( \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.Circuits.CircuitHost\" )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"CircuitHost type not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<PropertyInfo> RendererProp = new( () =>\n        CircuitHostType.Value.GetProperty( \"Renderer\", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"CircuitHost.Renderer property not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<PropertyInfo> DispatcherProp = new( () =>\n        RendererProp.Value.PropertyType.GetProperty( \"Dispatcher\", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"Renderer.Dispatcher property not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<MethodInfo> CheckAccessMI = new( () =>\n        DispatcherProp.Value.PropertyType.GetMethod( \"CheckAccess\", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public )\n        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException( \"Dispatcher.CheckAccess not found\" ) );\n\n    private static readonly Lazy<PropertyInfo> JsRuntimeProp = new( () =>\n        CircuitHostType.Value.GetProperty( \"JSRuntime\", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.NonPublic )\n        ??

I did not want to deal with hosting them on separate paths (through things like `<base href=xx/>` as it involved an existing application which would have been difficult to migrate, so they are exposed on separate domains. \n\nTo separate their assets I have been using \"StaticWebAssetBasePath\" in the csproj's to g et two folders in the wwwroot (say app-1 and app-2). So for the sake of discussion, i have app.com which gets (largely) served from wwwroot/app-1 and my.app.com which gets (largely) served from wwwroot/app-2. They are both able to use the same api which is accessible by route /api/xxx.\n\nSome issues I had with this are that the server had to be modified slightly to point the applications to the correct paths for certain requests (mostly different PathBase)\n- the `_content` directory is  published in the wwwroot instead of wwwroot/app-1, requests to assets here seem to work with the PathBase changes on the server.\n- resourcecollection.{fingerprint}.js and blazor.web.js do not exist on disk but generated by some middleware, it wont be served correctly unless the request pipeline has the correct PathBase set (app-1/app-2).\n- _framework/dotnet.js will not be found with these PathBase changes on the server. I have to manually prepend the PathBase _again_ to find the file like `/app-1/app-1/_framework/dotnet.js`. \n\nSo at this point I hack in a little middleware that essentially checks for any path `some.file` if `{pathbase}/some.file` exists on disk. Note that this does mean we are already looking for `app-1/_framework/dotnet.js` so we add the \"missing\" segment.\n\nNow here we are, up and running. A bit wacky that is has to be like this but sure. However, I noticed that fingerprinting is now suffering from the same weird double PathBase requirement issue:\n- Like with _framework/dotnet.js, I am already effectively serving `/app-1/app-1/main.js`. Even though the browser thinks its serving `/main.js`. To reiterate, I have to .UsePathBase in program.cs AND the middleware that adds the pathbase again, to the actual request path.\n- The fingerprinded asset paths (resolved in App.razor through the ComponentBase.Assets property) do not work either unless the path base is included in the path `/app-1/main.js`. \n\nIn the last point, I would be adding the pathbase THREE times. Amazingly, this would in turn break the resolution of _framework.dotnet.js and my middleware hack (which I am not keen on keeping) cannot work around this by checking for a file on disk, because only the StaticAssetsEndpointDataSource which knows which file the path may map to.\n\nSo I have gotten a bit stuck here. \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. Static asset requests involving assets in a StaticAssetsBasePath directory need not add multiple PathBase's in the request uri to be resolved, wether they are fingerprinted or not. \n2. Fingerprinting url resolution considers the StaticAssetsBasePath\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSample blazor web repo + add an extra client.\n\nServe each client from a separate 'sub application' using `MapWhen(ctx => domain == x, app => configureApp(app)`. and configure each app with a separate PathBase and UseEndpoints with MapStaticAssets and MapRazorComponents/MapRazorPages.\n\nThen set the StaticAssetsBasePath in each blazor client's csproj file, matching the respective pathbases ofcourse.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.203\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62249","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"MapStaticAssets, StaticWebAssetBasePath and multiple Blazor clients\"

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

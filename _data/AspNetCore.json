Search results (Customers component) will be updated whenever user clicks \"Search\" button inside the SearchOptions component.\r\nUser can then click on an individual customer listed in the grid (Customers component) - at that point, both CustomerDetail and Document components needed to be updated to display additional information on the selected customer.\r\n\r\n```\r\nViewCustomers Component (parent container)\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n|SearchOptions|Customers|CustomerDetail|\r\n|  Name       |         |--------------|\r\n|  Type       |         |Document      |\r\n|--------------------------------------|\r\n```\r\nI am trying to understand what is the best practice to implement this scenario. First (and simplest approach) that I tried was to capture a callback from child components in the parent ViewCustomers component and then issue a call to referenced child components as necessary. According to the (very sparse) documentation, this seems to be an anti-pattern.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div ...>\r\n    <SearchOptions OnSearch=\"Search\" />\r\n</div>\r\n<div ...>\r\n    <Customers @ref=\"m_customers\" OnSelectedCustomerChanged=\"SetCustomer\" />\r\n</div>\r\n<div ...>\r\n    <div ...>\r\n        <div ...>\r\n            <CustomerDetail @ref=\"m_customerDetail\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div ...>\r\n            <Document @ref=\"m_document\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n     </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n@code\r\n{\r\n    protected Customers m_customers;\r\n    protected CustomerDetail m_customerDetail;\r\n    protected Document m_document;\r\n\r\n    public void Search(SearchOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        m_customers.Search(options);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void SetCustomer(Guid customerGuid)\r\n    {\r\n        m_customerDetail.SetCustomerDetail(customerGuid);\r\n        m_document.LoadDocument(customerGuid);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSecond approach that I tried (which based on researching the very little information there is on Blazor) was to create a service (ComponentState) that various components subsribe to. Individual component can then trigger an event to notify a parent/sibling component that the other component will then handle. Since I am storing model (such as Search or CustomerGuid) inside each inidvidual component, I am using the service only as a notification mechanism. Is this the right pattern?\r\n\r\nOne problem using this approach that I ran into is limited types of scopes when registering service. In my real-world project, there can be multiple instances of the parent ViewCustomers component (think Visual Studio-like multi-tab UI) and I need to inject instance of ComponentState that will only notify child components within that instance. I cannot use singleton for obvious reasons, so I ended up registering the service using transient scope and then pass the injected ComponentState instance into child components using <CascadingValue> parameter. Is this the right approach?\r\n\r\n```\r\n@inject ComponentState State\r\n\r\n<CascadingValue Value=\"State\" Name=\"ComponentState\">\r\n    <div ...>\r\n        <SearchOptions />\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div ...>\r\n        <Customer />\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div ...>\r\n        <div ...>\r\n            <div ...>\r\n                <CustomerDetail />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div ...>\r\n                <Document />\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</CascadingValue>\r\n```\r\n```\r\npublic class ComponentState\r\n{\r\n    public event Action<Options> OnSearchOptionsChanged;\r\n    public event Action<Guid> OnCustomerGuidChanged;\r\n\r\n    public void SetSearchOptions(SearchOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        OnSearchOptionsChanged?.Invoke(options);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void SetCustomerGuid(Guid filingGuid)\r\n    {\r\n        OnCustomerGuidChanged?.Invoke(filingGuid);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class SearchOptionsBase : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n    [CascadingParameter(Name = \"ComponentState\")]\r\n    public ComponentState State { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    protected SearchOptions m_options = new SearchOptions();\r\n\r\n    protected void Submit()\r\n    {\r\n        State.SetSearchOptions(m_options);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class CustomersBase : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n    [CascadingParameter(Name=\"ComponentState\")]\r\n    public ComponentState State { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    protected IEnumerable<CustomersLookup> m_customers = new CustomersLookup[] { };\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnInitialized()\r\n    {\r\n        State.OnSearchOptionsChanged += State_OnSearchOptionsChanged;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void State_OnSearchOptionsChanged(SearchOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        // populate customers grid\r\n        // ...\r\n        StateHasChanged();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n{\r\n    services.AddRazorPages();\r\n    services.AddServerSideBlazor();\r\n\r\n    services.AddTransient<Services.ComponentState>();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to hear from someone on the Blazor team to answer the question. There are virtually no real-world examples of using Blazor, I think it would really help developers if Microsoft published several demo projects and ideally test this technology on creating an actual MS product - maybe this is already at works?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm very excited for the first official release!

Using this version of ASP.NET Core 3.0.100 (also tested on 2.2.301)\r\n2. Using the default Empty ASP.NET Core Web Application template use the following `Configure` method:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n        {\r\n            if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n            {\r\n                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            app.UseRouting();\r\n\r\n            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>\r\n            {\r\n                endpoints.MapGet(\"/\", async context =>\r\n                {\r\n                    string scheme = context.Request.Scheme;\r\n                    var headers = new Dictionary<string, StringValues>(\r\n                        context.Request.Headers\r\n                            .OrderBy(h => h.Key));\r\n\r\n                    context.Response.ContentType = \"application/json\";\r\n                    await context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new\r\n                    {\r\n                        Scheme = scheme,\r\n                        Headers = headers\r\n                    }));\r\n                });\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n3. Deploy to IIS (in my case I'm deploying to Azure) using the default InProcess hosting model.\r\n4.

Serve the endpoint\r\n4. Using Postman, run a GET request on your endpoint and note that the header `Content-Length` is not included.\r\n5. Run unit test:\r\n```\r\n[Fact]\r\npublic async Task RouteToMicrosoftIdentityAssociation()\r\n{\r\n    var response = await _client.GetAsync(\"/.well-known/microsoft-identity-association.json\");\r\n    var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\r\n    var contentType = response.Content.Headers.ContentType;\r\n\r\n    // We want exactly \"application/json\" with no charset.

Please describe.\r\nI have a package that I only include in Debug builds, and therefore some corresponding markup that I want to include in App.razor but only in Debug builds.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIn the App.Razor file I should be able to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#if DEBUG\r\n    @using NetPack.BrowserReload.BlazorClient\r\n    <BrowserReload></BrowserReload>\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere in my csproj I have a conditional package import:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"NetPack.BrowserReload.BlazorClient\" Version=\"0.3.0-alpha0141\" Condition=\"$(DefineConstants.Contains(DEBUG))\" />\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe trouble is, since the package isn't imported in Release builds, the @using statement above will cause an error during compilation - unless I can omit it during release compilation. Likewise compilation directives aren't supported in _Imports.razor either - so I can't include the using statement there due to the same reason.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I omit the @using statement completely, and just use the fully type name of the component:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <NetPack.BrowserReload.BlazorClient.BrowserReload></NetPack.BrowserReload.BlazorClient.BrowserReload>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Release build still fails because because obviously that components does not exist in Release build configuration. May I point out that in previous previews ob Blazor this wasn't a problem - because even though no such component existed in a release build, the build completed successfully. However in a more recent preview release of blazor, razor compiler got stricter - now if the markup isn't recognised as a valid HTML or component, then it causes a build error which fails the build - so now this has become a problem. Previoulsy, because the build suceeded, I could work around the problem by using a runtime check to display the component only for debug builds in my markup:\r\n\r\nApp.razor:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n@if (EnvironmentInfo.IsDebug())\r\n{  \r\n    < NetPack.BrowserReload.BlazorClient.BrowserReload />\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `EnvironmentInfo` was a class that looked like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n   public class EnvironmentInfo\r\n    {       \r\n        public static bool IsDebug()\r\n        {\r\n#if DEBUG\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"DEBUG TRUE\");\r\n            return true;\r\n#else\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"DEBUG FALSE\");\r\n            return false;\r\n#endif\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis no longer works, because the build now fails when the razor file is compiled due to not being able to find the component. So I am now stuck for ideas.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service attack in the Microsoft OData library used in ASP.NET could cause a denial of service against an OData web application. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the OData application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by updating the version of OData ASP.NET Core uses.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/13860\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\n* If your application does not use ASP.NET Core's OData implementation or your application does not use Azure Storage to store data protect keys you are not affected.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses `Microsoft.Data.OData.dll` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` shared framework with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll | 2.1.1 <br /> 2.2.0 | 2.1.2 <br /> 2.2.1\r\nMicrosoft.Data.OData | < 5.8.4 | 5.8.4\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.All | 2.1.0 - 2.1.12 <br /> 2.2.0 - 2.2.6 | 2.1.13 <br /> 2.2.7\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nIf you have .NET Core 2.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.0.100-preview3-010431\r\n Commit:    d72abce213\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview3-010431\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5\r\n  Commit:  3844df9537\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.604 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100-preview3-010431 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\\\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-19153-02 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview3-27504-2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1, you should download Runtime 2.1.13 or SDK 2.1.509 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.1.606 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.1.802 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.2, you should download Runtime 2.2.7 or SDK 2.2.109 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.2.206 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.2.402 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 2.1 and 2.2, you need to install updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nIf you have [pinned your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/selection) to a specific version of the runtime, you must update your app, recompile and redeploy it for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. Even if you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` or `Microsoft.Data.OData` directly you may still be affected if either package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends on `Contoso.Internals`, your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll/2.1.1` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n# Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application, created using vulnerable project templates, fails to properly sanitize web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform content injection attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email, containing a malicious link, to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in all cases to exploit this vulnerability a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles content encoding and updates the application templates to depend on the corrected code libraries.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/13859\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf your application does not ASP.NET SPA services your application is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core based application running on ASP.NET Core 2.1.0-2.1.1, or ASP.NET Core 2.2.0 or any preview of ASP.NET Core 3.0.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices | 2.1.0-2.1.1 <br /> 2.2.0 | 2.1.2 <br /> 2.2.1\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core v3 will be updated with its RTM release.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nIf you have .NET Core 2.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.0.100-preview3-010431\r\n Commit:    d72abce213\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview3-010431\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5\r\n  Commit:  3844df9537\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.604 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100-preview3-010431 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\\\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-19153-02 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview3-27504-2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1, you should download Runtime 2.1.13 or SDK 2.1.509 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.1.606 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.1.802 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.2, you should download Runtime 2.2.7 or SDK 2.2.109 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.2.206 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.2.402 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 2.1 and 2.2, you need to install updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nIf you have [pinned your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/selection) to a specific version of the runtime, you must update your app, recompile and redeploy it for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nYou must now update your existing SPA services projects to use the newer version of the vulnerable packages.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n# Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Unfortunately, we missed a critical design flaw which prevents this from working end-to-end.\r\n\r\nTrying to invoke build on a project with a `Counter` component that looked like the following would result in a build error:\r\n```Razor\r\n<Counter @ref=\"myCounter\" />\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    // This will not compile because there will be no backing field for myCounter\r\n    private readonly int _incrementingBy = myCounter.IncrementAmount;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that we're so close to a 3.0 release, we are going to cut this feature from 3.0. We will think about viable solutions to this in future releases, if we can find one, we may consider it then.\r\n\r\n### The problem deep dive\r\nTo summarize the problem effectively, I need to describe how the Razor compilation process works. It's a two-phase process:\r\n\r\n1. Discovery: All the components and directive attributes are discovered. Razor does this by generating a skeleton of each component file and then introspecting on their structure, we call these files declarations. Basically, any content in your Razor file that isn't a directive or inside of a directive block `@code` is thrown out to avoid compilation errors during this phase.\r\n2. Compiling: The actual Razor file compilation where it uses the inputs resolved in phase 1. This phase utilizes all of discovered components to properly parse HTML elements that look like components and uses all of the discovered directive attributes to properly parse those elements corresponding attributes that look like directive attributes.\r\n\r\nThe process is broken into two phases to enable Components to be written in Razor yet also impact other Razor files in the project. This is why you can write a `Counter.razor` file and still recursively use it in the same `Counter.razor` file.\r\n\r\nThe core problem is that during the `discovery` phase the Razor compiler has no awareness of the available components or directive attributes (it hasn't discovered them yet). This means, the `@ref` attribute and other component's existence is not available in this phase. This introduces a problem because a user may have written code in their `@code` block that references the supposed backing field generated from `@ref`; however, during discovery we didn't know about `@ref` so no backing field was generated. This results in Razor skeleton file that can't be compiled or introspected on (C# errors). We considered working around this limitation by hard coding `@ref` to not require the first phase but quickly found that would not work either because if a user writes `<Counter @ref=\"myCounter\" />` We need to generate a proper type name for the auto-generated backing field (`private Counter myCounter;`) which isn't reliably available because during the discovery phase we haven't yet discovered anything (it's not till phase 2 that we know of `Counter`).\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nIn 3.0.0-preview8 in order to utilize the `@ref` attribute you must do:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<button @ref=\"myButton\" @ref:suppressField />\r\n@code {\r\n    ElementReference myButton;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce 3.0.0-preview9 and up ships you will be able to use the older syntax such as:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<button @ref=\"myButton\" />\r\n@code {\r\n    ElementReference myButton;\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/381","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Removing automatic backing field support for @ref in 3.0.0-preview9\" (#381)"},{"Id":"480691511","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-14T13:51:16","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"380","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change Identity UI uses the new static web assets","State":"open","Body":"In ASP.NET Core 3.0 we've moved Identity UI to use the new static web assets feature introduced in 3.0.

This does not indicate a specific name or timeline for the initial preview release, it’s just a pre-release tag that allows us the flexibility to change the version as necessary. The [.NET Core Roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md) is the authoritative source for committed release schedules. \r\n\r\nAt present, this change is only relevant if you contribute to ASP.NET Core repositories. Otherwise, we recommend that you wait for the official 5.0 Preview releases before installing this new version.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at: aspnet/AspNetCore#12732\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nThe following repos have moved their master branches to \"5.0\":\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore)\r\n* [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* [aspnet/Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor)\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the [aspnet/EntityFramework6](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6) repository has changed version numbers to 6.4 to reflect a version after the 6.3 release in progress. Again, there is no specific timeline or committment for this release.\r\n\r\nVersion numbers may still change during the development cycle for 5.0. This change is being done to reflect the current plans. \r\n\r\nIn large part, we switched master to 5.0 to enable to the community to contribute changes. As the .NET Core 3.0 release progresses towards the final build, we're increasing scrutiny on the changes we will accept. Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no SDK or developer experience for 5.0. Switching your project file to target `netcoreapp5.0` won't do anything useful. Look for a follow-up announcement when this experience is available.\r\n\r\n## Which branch has what?\r\n\r\nHere's a brief table listing the branches and the releases they are targeting:\r\n\r\n| Repository | 3.0 | 5.0 |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) | [`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master) |\r\n| [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling) |[`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling/tree/master) |\r\n| [aspnet/Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor) | [`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/tree/master) |\r\n| [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) |[`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/tree/master) |\r\n| [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions) | [`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/tree/master) |\r\n\r\nChanges for the 3.1 LTS release (planned for [November 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md)) will be picked from changes made in 5.0 (master).

If you're using HttpResponse directly you should not need to make any code changes. Read further if you were wrapping or replacing HttpResponse.Body or accessing HttpContext.Features.\r\n\r\nVersion: 3.0.0-preview8\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nHttpContext, HttpRequest, HttpResponse are backed by an abstraction called [Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/request-features?view=aspnetcore-2.2). This allows functionality to be provided by different components in the pipeline without wrapping the entire HttpContext.\r\n\r\nIn 2.x there are three APIs associated with the response body: IHttpResponseFeature.Body, IHttpSendFileFeature.SendFileAsync, and IHttpBufferingFeature.DisableResponseBuffering, but the later two were rarely implemented or used.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 3.0 several new response body APIs were added:\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature.StartAsync\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature.CompleteAsync\r\n\r\nProblem: With so many APIs it became too hard for middleware to properly intercept the response body. It was also hard for calling code to rely on those features being present on all servers.\r\n\r\nFix: Consolidate the response body APIs onto a single new feature interface [IHttpResponseBodyFeature](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http.Features/src/IHttpResponseBodyFeature.cs). HttpResponse has been updated accordingly, and each server has been updated to provide at least a minimal implementation for all of these APIs. We'll iterate to provide more fully featured implementations in each server but that won't require any more API changes.\r\n\r\nNote if you replace HttpResponse.Body it will now replace the entire IHttpResponseBodyFeature with a wrapper around your given stream using StreamResponseBodyFeature to provide default implementations for all of the expected APIs. Setting back the original stream will undo this change.\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http/src/Internal/DefaultHttpResponse.cs#L67-L89\r\n\r\nBreaking change https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/12328\r\n\r\nObsolete existing 2.x APIs\r\nIHttpResponseFeature.Body\r\nIHttpSendFileFeature\r\nIHttpBufferingFeature\r\n\r\nDeleted feature interfaces that were introduced earlier in 3.0.\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature\r\n\r\nIn a future major release we plan to refactor the request body features as well https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12620.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12635 for discussion.\r\n\r\nThis announcement has been migrated to: dotnet/docs#14832","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/376","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpResponse body infrastructure changes\" (#376)"},{"Id":"473077311","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-25T21:25:57","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"375","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change in IAuthorizationPolicyProvider","State":"open","Body":"As part of https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/9759 we added a new method to `IAuthorizationPolicyProvider.GetFallbackPolicyAsync` which is the policy that will be used by the authorization middleware when no policy is specified.\r\n\r\nThis announcement has been migrated to: dotnet/docs#14834","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/375","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking change in IAuthorizationPolicyProvider\" (#375)"},{"Id":"472946568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-25T15:58:23","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"374","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change in SignInManager constructor (new parameter)","State":"open","Body":"As part of adding support for new email/confirmation flows in Identity(https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/8356), we added a new `IUserConfirmation<TUser>` argument to the constructor of `SignInManager`\r\n\r\nThis announcement has been migrated to: dotnet/docs#14828\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking change in SignInManager constructor (new parameter)\" (#374)"},{"Id":"465890178","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-09T17:01:09","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"373","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1075: ASP.NET Core Spoofing Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1075: ASP.NET Core Spoofing Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and 2.2.

Here's the code change required to migrate to use `System.Text.Json`:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n// Before\r\nstring value = Json.Serialize(...);\r\nMyPoco poco = Json.Deserialize<MyPoco>(\"...\");\r\n\r\n// After\r\nusing System.Text.Json.Serialization;\r\n...\r\n\r\nstring value = JsonSerializer.ToString(...);\r\nMyPoco poco = JsonSerializer.Parse<MyPoco>(\"...\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `DotNetObjectRef` is replaced by a generic `DotNetObjectRef<T>` that is required for both sending and receiving a managed object reference when doing interop with the browser\r\n    \r\n```C#\r\n// Before\r\nIJSRuntime.InvokeAsync(\"SomeJSMethod\", new DotNetObjectRef(someObject));\r\n\r\n[JSInvokable]\r\npublic static Task SomeDotNetMethod(MyObject myObject)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After\r\nIJSRuntime.InvokeAsync(\"SomeMethod\", DotNetObjectRef.Create(someObject));\r\n\r\n[JSInvokable]\r\npublic static Task SomeDotNetMethod(DotNetObjectRef<MyObject> myObject)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.JSInterop will use System.Text.Json to marshal interop data. To customize serialization, you may use serialization primitives such as `JsonPropertyNameAttribute`, `JsonIgnoreAttribute ` etc.\r\n\r\n* `IJSRuntime.UntrackObjectRef(DotNetObjectRef);` has been removed. To stop tracking an object reference, dispose the `DotNetObjectRef<T>` instance either on the server or the client.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10810 for further discussions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/364","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking changes to Microsoft.JSInterop \" (#364)"},{"Id":"451308302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-03T06:11:51","Actor":"davidfowl","Number":"363","RawContent":null,"Title":"Kestrel's transport abstractions have been removed and made public instead of pubternal","State":"open","Body":"As part of moving away from pubternal APIs in we're in the process of exposing the Kestrel transport layer as a public interface in 3.0.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10238\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses any of following vulnerable packages:\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4<br/>1.1.0 | 1.0.11<br/>1.1.5\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` directly you may still be affected if you are using SignalR and the package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

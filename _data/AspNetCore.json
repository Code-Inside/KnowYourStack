We've been in production without any significant code changes for a couple of years and other than keeping the AspNet version relatively up to date we've rarely updated this part of the code.  In the last few weeks we've been seeing a much higher failure rate from our calling applications, they are receiving 408 errors.  Traffic has been growing recently but is nowhere near our historic highs and our load testing shows we should support much higher RPS/QPS than we currently see (5x at least) so this appears to have something do with a change in the call pattern to the service.  In particular we tend to be skewing to smaller payloads which process quickly (30-100 msec). However some of our payloads can cause much longer processing times (2000 msec-5000 msec) though these are somewhat less frequent.   \r\n\r\nThe pattern observed in our logs suggests that for a given session the series of queries sent to our service execute fine (perhaps a 100 or more) but then randomly fail for a few seconds and then resume normal operation.  From looking at the AspNet logs we've observed that the failing queries don't appear to leave behind any logging at all in the controller, acting like we never see the query at all.  We have an ILogger enabled and see \"Request starting HTTP/1.1 PUT https...\"  as our earliest logging entry for an payload that will successfully process.  We've not been able to find additional logging that starts earlier in the process than that.   We've profiled the code and the hot path is generally in communicating via proxy to send the payload off to the worker process.  We do wait for the result via await and have taken care to make sure all of our code is async.   \r\n\r\nIs there any suggested ways to diagnose issues like this?  We are seeing the issue in production only so our ability to instrument there is limited and in any case it's not clear what we'd even instrument since our code doesn't get a chance at the payload in the failure cases. \r\n\r\nThanks","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41187","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Diagnosing production performance issues - missing PUT requests\" (#41187)"},{"Id":"1203819040","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-14T01:39:07","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"41180","RawContent":null,"Title":"[SignalR] Pass cancellation token to FlushAsync","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40475\r\n\r\nThe token wasn't being passed in because of a bug in Pipelines see original change https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/1718#discussion_r177283449\r\nThe bug was fixed a day after the PR was merged and we never reacted 🤣 \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/25633\r\n\r\nFor full transparency, this doesn't mean the written Hub message wont be sent to the server.

So when we want to pass the literal \"%abc\", the encoded url is api/%25abc .\r\n\r\nBy default, IIS will reject this with status 404.11 due to security reasons. We have to set the following in web.config for IIS to allow this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<system.webServer>\r\n    <security>\r\n      <requestFiltering allowDoubleEscaping=\"true\" />\r\n    </security>\r\n</system.webServer>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that while this works with the example string \"%abc\", other values break or even cause internal exceptions due to ASP .NET Core unescaping the already unescaped URL. For example calling \"api/%2542\" which should result in id being the literal \"%42\" instead results in \"B\".\r\n\r\nThe URL api/%2500\" even causes the following exception because 00 is unescaped to a null-byte.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS.Core.IISHttpServer: Error: Connection ID \"17654110548687585306\", Request ID \"4000001b-0002-f500-b63f-84710c7967bb\": An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.\r\n\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: The path contains null characters.\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Internal.UrlDecoder.DecodeCore(Int32& sourceIndex, Int32& destinationIndex, Span`1 buffer)\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Internal.UrlDecoder.DecodeInPlace(Span`1 buffer)\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.PathString.FromUriComponent(String uriComponent)\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.Extensions.UsePathBaseMiddleware.InvokeCore(HttpContext context, String matchedPath, String remainingPath)\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS.Core.IISHttpContextOfT`1.ProcessRequestAsync()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is with Windows 11 and the latest .NET Hosting Bundle 6.0.4. I can't reproduce this with IIS Express. #30655 may be related, but it does not seem to be specific to IIS.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nValue from URL is unescaped correctly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nDefine the following method:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[HttpGet(\"test/{id}\")]\r\npublic ActionResult Get(string id)\r\n{\r\n  return Ok(id);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart the application in IIS (not IIS Express).\r\n\r\nCalling the URL \"test/%2500\" will cause the mentioned internal exception.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

This was not possible with the older API because there was no place to store the internal event subscriptions. The new API returns an object that holds the state necessary to remove data annotations validation support on disposal.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\n**This does not affect most applications, because most applications do not call this directly anyway.** Most applications instead use the `<DataAnnotationsValidator>` component, and do not need to be changed. The use of the extension methods discussed here is a rare and advanced case.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you do call `editContext.AddDataAnnotationsValidation()`, then replace that call with `editContext.EnableDataAnnotationsValidation()`.

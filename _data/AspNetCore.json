Please describe the problem.\n\nI'm advocating for Blazor in enterprise projects due to its unified language stack applicable across web, windows, mobile, and other platforms. However, corporate inertia and front-end developer preference for open-source JavaScript frameworks, notably React, often hinder these Blazor proposals.\r\n\r\nTechnological hurdles in reusing component libraries from other ecosystems often impede Blazor adoption, despite its advantages for C# developers.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nMicrosoft greatly enhances support for re-using open-source Javascript framework ecosystems within Blazor applications by adding features and documentation for that re-use.\r\n\r\nA response to this feature request could be along the lines of \"great idea, feel free to implement it\" 😄. However, I would argue that if increased Blazor adoption is considered, then this sort of feature is arguably more important than other more technically focused features and also best considered by the core Blazor developers.\r\n\r\nThe exact nature of the enhancements is best defined by Microsoft Blazor experts but I've included some potential approaches from the perspective of a developer with admittedly basic front end skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Qwikify Approach\r\n\r\n- Include a Blazor component wrapper or tooling that allows a React component to be embedded using an approach inspired by the [$qwikify](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/integrations/react/#qwikify) functionality from the [Qwik framework](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/).\r\n- Document the caveats in terms of preference for \"larger\" components being embedded for performance reasons.\r\n- Include support for wrapping, hydration control and easy access to properties/events using Blazor idioms.\r\n\r\n### Mitosis Approach\r\n\r\n- Contribute a Blazor target to the [Mitosis toolset](https://github.com/builderio/mitosis).\r\n- Ensure the generated Blazor component includes idiomatic support for Blazor properties/binding/events.\r\n\r\n### Web Components Approach\r\n\r\n- Include a Blazor component wrapper or tooling that allows web components to be easily embedded or generated as a Blazor library.\r\n- The intent would be to allow a web component library to be used in a Blazor project with support for properties/binding/events as idiomatic Blazor code without friction for the Application developer and without the need for a wrapper open source project for each web component library\r\n\r\n### Documentation Approach\r\n\r\nIdeally, the Microsoft solution would implement a Microsoft extension library containing Blazor functionality extensions for re-using React (or other) ecosystem artifacts. However, this might not be easily organized with the broader aspnetcore product development and maintenance process. An alternative is to produce documentation and sample code which has the multiple benefits of:\r\n\r\n- Informing developers of how to build wrapper components and/or tooling for integrating Javascript framework components and artifacts into a Blazor library. The emphasis should be on a fully wrapped result for Blazor developers rather than a myriad set of snippets that end up littering Blazor source code.\r\n- Providing a complete but not \"maintained by Microsoft\" starting point for others to use in their own code or start an open source project.\r\n\r\nI would be personally prefer that Microsoft take up the baton of simplifying external javascript component integration for Blazor developers and particularly for React. However if that request results in a \"no\", then a documentation based approach is better than nothing to help wear down the friction of adoption in the face of javascript framework incumbents.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49731","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Features and documentation to increase Blazor

For example:\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\n\r\npublic static class StackExchangeRedisCacheServiceCollectionExtensions\r\n{\r\n+    public static IServiceCollection AddStackExchangeRedisCache(this IServiceCollection services)\r\n+    public static IServiceCollection AddStackExchangeRedisOutputCache(this IServiceCollection services)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nservices\r\n  .AddOptions<MyOwnRedisOptions>\r\n  .BindConfiguration(MyOwnRedisOptions.SectionName)\r\n  .Validate(options => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(options.ConnectionString), \"configuration for redis ConnectionString cannot be null or ...... \")\r\n  .Validate(options => options...............);\r\n  //...\r\n\r\nservices\r\n  .AddOptions<RedisCacheOptions>()\r\n  .Configure<IOptions<MyOwnRedisOptions>>((redisCacheOptions, myOwnRedisOptions) =>\r\n  {\r\n    redisCacheOptions.Configuration = myOwnRedisOptions.Value.ConnectionString;\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n\r\nservices.AddStackExchangeRedisCache()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\nNot exactly a fan of using `null` as optional overload in general. It opens the code to more nullability check or bug tracking NRE like \"well I was sure I gave it a value\".\r\n\r\nPS: Only writing it for `AddStackExchangeRedisCache` but it would be the the same for the `OutputCache` as well\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\n\r\npublic static class StackExchangeRedisCacheServiceCollectionExtensions\r\n{\r\n+    public static IServiceCollection AddStackExchangeRedisCache(this IServiceCollection services, Action<RedisCacheOptions> setupAction = null)\r\n{\r\n        ArgumentNullThrowHelper.ThrowIfNull(services);\r\n-       ArgumentNullThrowHelper.ThrowIfNull(setupAction);\r\n\r\n        services.AddOptions();\r\n-       services.Configure(setupAction);\r\n+       if(setupAction != null)\r\n+       {\r\n+           services.Configure(setupAction);\r\n+       }\r\n\r\n        services.Add(ServiceDescriptor.Singleton<IDistributedCache, RedisCacheImpl>());\r\n\r\n        return services;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\n\r\npublic static class StackExchangeRedisCacheServiceCollectionExtensions\r\n{\r\n+    public static IServiceCollection AddStackExchangeRedisCache(this IServiceCollection services, Action<RedisCacheOptions> setupAction = null)\r\n{\r\n        ArgumentNullThrowHelper.ThrowIfNull(services);\r\n-       ArgumentNullThrowHelper.ThrowIfNull(setupAction);\r\n\r\n        services.AddOptions();\r\n-       services.Configure(setupAction);\r\n+       services.Configure(setupAction ?? _ => {});\r\n\r\n        services.Add(ServiceDescriptor.Singleton<IDistributedCache, RedisCacheImpl>());\r\n\r\n        return services;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nThe risk of bad setup/configuration is still owned by inner implementation such as `RedisCache` / `RedisCacheImpl` etc ...","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49721","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add flexibility to AddStackExchangeRedisCache by removing setupAction\" (#49721)"},{"Id":"1827422153","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-29T09:38:22","Actor":"marinasundstrom","Number":"49720","RawContent":null,"Title":"Identity endpoints break clients generated from Open API ","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI'm having the identity endpoints mapped in my project.

But the Pool is still in Stopping state until `Shutdown Time Limit (seconds)` (default 90) configured on the Pool is reached.\r\nWe've narrowed it down to browsers issuing requests with `Connection: keep-alive` header and `Connection Timeout` (default 120) configured in the `Limits` section for IIS Web Site.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced with simple Hello World application. Issue request from a browser (tested with Chrome), keep the browser open. Execute `Measure-Command {.\\appcmd.exe stop apppool /apppool.name:\"temp\"| Out-Default}` to stop the pool and check how long it takes. If browser is completely closed or there were no requests made or if connection is forcibly closed (say with Sysinternals TcpView) - Pool stops immediately.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT.

These are some possible options that will keep the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return Accepted(new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status202Accepted, new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic Model Get()\r\n{\r\n   Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n   return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC/API Controller actions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/485","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ActionResult<T> set StatusCode to 200\" (#485)"},{"Id":"1149914360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T20:33:05","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"482","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\n\nStarting in .NET 7, Blazor components use [`ActivatorUtilities`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities) to instantiate components. This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

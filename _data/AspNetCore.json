blazor web templates that ensure that host name prefixes generated for new projects that opt-in to the `--localhost-tld` option don't violate RFC 952/1123.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe template/tooling generates DNS names (e.g., hostnames or domain labels) that contain underscores (_) when the user opts-in to the `--localhost-tld` template option and the project name includes characters that are invalid in a C# class name. According to DNS hostname specifications (RFC 952 and RFC 1123), underscores are not valid characters in hostnames. This causes failures in environments and libraries that strictly validate DNS names (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker, cloud DNS, and DNS client libraries).\r\n\r\nFixes #64978\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCurrently when opting in to using `*.dev.localhost` host names for a new project using the empty or blazor web project templates, depending on the name given to the project the generated host name prefix used in the project launch profiles may violate rules in RFC 952/1123 which can lead to it causing errors or being rejected in other systems during local development, e.g.:\r\n\r\n- DNS resolution errors in client libraries.\r\n- Browser can refuse to parse the host name if it starts with `xn--` and is followed by characters that would make it an invalid IDN name.\r\n- Operational inconsistencies if environments silently mutate invalid names.\r\n- Developer confusion when template output contradicts DNS standards.\r\n\r\nThe generated host name can be edited directly in the project's `Properties/launchSettings.json` file to workaround this issue once the project is created.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\nThe option was newly added in .NET 10 and has had this behavior since its inclusion.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [x] Low\r\n\r\nChange to the template declared symbols and transforms only using established templating system capabilities.\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\n- [x] Manual (required)\r\n- [x] Automated\r\n\r\nUnit tests are included.\r\n\r\n## Packaging changes reviewed?\r\n\r\n- [x] N/A","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65048","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/10.0] Backport fixes to templates derived *.dev.localhost hostnames in launch profiles\" (#65048)"},{"Id":"3809984289","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T21:08:12","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"65044","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove xcopy-msbuild & vs entries from global.json","State":"closed","Body":"We probably don't use this anymore","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65044","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove xcopy-msbuild & vs entries from global.json\" (#65044)"},{"Id":"3809880781","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T19:07:15","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"65042","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update JDK version in InstallJdk.ps1","State":"closed","Body":"Update default JDK version in InstallJdk.ps1 convenience script","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65042","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update JDK version in InstallJdk.ps1\" (#65042)"},{"Id":"3806282666","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T18:58:16","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"65027","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure repeated hyphens are replaced with single hyphens in new projects' localhost host name prefixes","State":"closed","Body":"# Ensure repeated hyphens are replaced with single hyphens in new projects' localhost host name prefixes\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nEnsures that there are no repeated hyphens in the host name generated for new projects that opt-in to the `*.dev.localhost` host name.\r\n\r\nRelated to #64978\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65027","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Ensure repeated hyphens are replaced with single hyphens in new projects' localhost host name prefixes\" (#65027)"},{"Id":"3804262346","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T18:39:34","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"65021","RawContent":null,"Title":"None Include in .csproj don't work for subdirectory under wwwroot","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/None-Include-in-csproj-dont-work-for-s/11026428)._\n\n---\n[severity:It's more difficult to complete my work]\nin a blazor web app, I got a directory called **logs** under wwwroot.\nThe debug team use the **error.json** file in it to debug.\nThe **error.json** can also be populated in server environment.\nwhen we publish the app, the local **error.json** must not overwrite the server **error.json**\n\nThe **logs** directory must appear in the vs solution tree as a debug tool for dev.\nsome method to exclude that folder of publish work but make the directory invisible in vs studio.\n\nI tried many methods like \n&lt;None Include=\"wwwroot\\logs\\**\\*\" CopyToOutputDirectory=\"PreserveNewest\" /&gt;\nbut it result in publishing the local **error.json** to server.\nI don't think it's the attended behavior.\n\neveytime we publish, we need to ensure first to delete the local file or make a copy of the server file to avoir it being replaced.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 1/12/2026, 04:06 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

We can insert the configuration source instead of adding it, however we notice that when doing so, `WebApplicationBuilder`'s `ConfigurationManager` reloads all the configuration sources already in the collection. This is not the case when `Add`-ing new configuration sources.\n\nLoading configuration sources more than once is problematic as some (Azure App Configuration, for instance) can take a lot of time, especially when some configuration keys link to Azure Key Vaults. Doing this work several times impacts negatively the startup time of an application that uses `WebApplicationBuilder`.\n\nWe could defer inserting this slow-to-(re)load configuration source at the very end of the Configuration.Sources manipulations, which means that only fast-to-load sources would be reloaded, but this workaround stops working when using more than one slow-to-load configuration source.\n\nIt is unfortunately our case, since we use two Azure App Configuration sources (one for our general configuration and one for feature flags).\n\nIs there any guidance on how to achieve this: adding configuration sources with a lower priority than the highest to the default sources collection, without loading sources more than once, using `WebApplicationBuilder`?\n\nThanks a lot for your input.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65041","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to avoid loading configuration providers multiple times when manipulating configuration sources in WebApplicationBuilder/ConfigurationManager?\" (#65041)"},{"Id":"3806329022","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:19:16","Actor":"MackinnonBuck","Number":"65028","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace `OwnsOne()` with `ComplexProperty()` for passkey data","State":"closed","Body":"Addresses `ToJson()` being deprecated for owned entities.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't require customers to migrate their databases, so it's safe to modify the existing schema without introducing a new Identity store schema version.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65018","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65028","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Replace `OwnsOne()` with `ComplexProperty()` for passkey data\" (#65028)"},{"Id":"3809795267","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:15:00","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"65040","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable parallel restore for Grpc JsonTranscoding","State":"open","Body":"Attempt to work around https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61178","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65040","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Disable parallel restore for Grpc JsonTranscoding\" (#65040)"},{"Id":"3807222307","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T16:45:53","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"65031","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"closed","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

Provides an API with pluggable storage backends (cookies by default, session as alternative) that automatically manages data lifecycle without requiring custom solutions or interactivity modes.\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nRight now in the Blazor SSR there is a gap in the storage in-between requests (see https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49683). Currently to store data in-between requests, users are supposed to create their own solutions even for the simplest of the situations (e.g. success page after redirect) or use interactivity to escape the problem altogether. We already have multiple solutions for this problem in the MVC that we can use as a template. TempData is one of them that allows users to persist values in-between requests. \n\nTempData provides short-lived, server-side storage that survives exactly one additional HTTP request (read-once semantics) or more, if the user wants to do so. By default it is write-read-delete, but there is an option to read it without deletion. It's specifically designed for redirect scenarios where data needs to pass from one request to another but should not persist longer.\n\n## In scope\n\n- Automatically delete data after being read, with opt-in retention via `Peek()` and `Keep()` methods.\n- TempData works out-of-the-box with cookie storage when calling `AddRazorComponents()`.\n- Support both cookie-based (default) and session-based storage providers.\n- Support primitives, DateTime, Guid, enums, and collections (arrays, List<T>, Dictionary<string, T>).\n- Automatic lifecycle management (no manual save/load needed).\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Support for user-defined classes or custom object serialization is not a goal. Only JSON-serializable primitives and collections are supported.\n- Using both cookie and session storage simultaneously is not supported. Developers must choose one storage mechanism per application.\n- TempData is designed for SSR scenarios only. Support for Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor Server is excluded as they have different state management patterns.\n- Pluggable serialization providers beyond the built-in JSON serializer are not supported.\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n\n- **Cookie Size Limits:** browsers enforce 4KB cookie limits. Developers storing large amounts of data may exceed this limit, causing silent data loss or HTTP 400 errors. *Mitigation:* use `ChunkingCookieManager` to automatically split cookies across multiple cookie headers and recommendation to use session storage for larger data needs.\n\n- **Session Affinity Requirements:** Session storage requires sticky sessions in load-balanced environments. Without it, users may lose data mid-flow. *Mitigation:* clear documentation that session storage requires session affinity or distributed cache and recommendations for using cookies for stateless deployments.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Basic form with flash messages:**\n```razor\n@page \"/my-form\"\n@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager\n\n<p id=\"message\">@_message</p>\n\n<form method=\"post\" @formname=\"MyForm\" @onsubmit=\"HandleSubmit\">\n    <AntiforgeryToken />\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"Name\" />\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n\n@code {\n    [CascadingParameter]\n    public ITempData? TempData { get; set; }\n\n    private string? _message;\n\n    protected override void OnInitialized()\n    {\n        // Get removes the value after reading (one-time use)\n        _message = TempData?.Get(\"Message\") as string ?? \"No message\";\n    }\n\n    private void HandleSubmit()\n    {\n        // Set success message\n        TempData![\"Message\"] = \"Form submitted successfully!\";\n        \n        // Redirect - message will be available on next request\n        NavigationManager.NavigateTo(\"/my-form\", forceLoad: true);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Reading without consuming (Peek):**\n```razor\n@code {\n    protected override void OnInitialized()\n    {\n        // Peek reads without removing - value available on next request too\n        var notification = TempData?.Peek(\"Notification\") as string;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Keeping values for another request:**\n```razor\n@code {\n    protected override void OnInitialized()\n    {\n        var message = TempData?.Get(\"Message\") as string;\n        \n        // Keep this specific value for one more request\n        TempData?.Keep(\"Message\");\n        \n        // Or keep all values\n        TempData?.Keep();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Detailed design\n\n### Overview\n\nTempData is automatically enabled when calling `AddRazorComponents()` and provided to components as a cascading value. It uses pluggable storage backends (cookies by default, with session storage as an alternative) and implements read-once semantics where values are automatically removed after being read unless explicitly retained.\n\n### Storage Providers\n\nDevelopers can choose between two storage mechanisms:\n\n#### Cookie-Based Storage (Default)\n\nCookie storage works out-of-the-box without additional configuration. The implementation:\n- Serializes data to JSON and encrypts it using ASP.NET Core Data Protection APIs\n- Stores encrypted data in a cookie named `.AspNetCore.Components.TempData`\n- Automatically handles cookie chunking for larger payloads\n\n**Configuration:**\n```csharp\n// Default - no configuration needed\nbuilder.Services.AddRazorComponents();\n\n// Optional: Customize cookie settings\nbuilder.Services.AddCookieTempDataValueProvider(options =>\n{\n    options.Cookie.Name = \".MyApp.TempData\";\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict;\n});\n```\n\n#### Session Storage\n\nSession storage is available for scenarios requiring larger data storage or when cookies are undesirable:\n- Requires explicit session state configuration\n- No practical size limits (within session constraints)\n- Requires sticky sessions in load-balanced environments\n\n**Configuration:**\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();\nbuilder.Services.AddSession();\nbuilder.Services.AddSessionStorageTempDataValueProvider();\n\napp.UseSession();\n```\n\n### Component Access\n\nTempData is provided as a cascading value, making it accessible throughout the component hierarchy without explicit injection:\n\n```razor\n@code {\n    [CascadingParameter]\n    public ITempData? TempData { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n### API Design\n\nThe `ITempData` interface extends `IDictionary<string, object?>` for familiarity with MVC developers, while adding specialized methods for controlling retention:\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ITempData : IDictionary<string, object?>\n{\n    object? Get(string key);      // Read and mark for deletion\n    object? Peek(string key);     // Read without marking for deletion\n    void Keep();                  // Retain all values for next request\n    void Keep(string key);        // Retain specific value for next request\n}\n```\n\n### Read-Once Semantics\n\nTempData implements automatic cleanup to prevent stale data:\n\n1. **On Load**: All values from storage are marked as \"retained\" (available for this request)\n2. **On Access**: `Get()` removes the retention marker; `Peek()` preserves it\n3. **On Save**: Only retained values are persisted to storage\n4. **Developer Control**: `Keep()` re-adds retention markers to override automatic deletion\n\nThis ensures data persists exactly as long as needed without manual cleanup.\n\n### Supported Data Types\n\nTempData supports JSON-serializable types:\n- **Primitives**: `string`, `int`, `bool`, `double`, `decimal`, etc.\n- **Common Types**: `Guid`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `TimeSpan`, `Uri`.\n- **Collections**: Arrays, `List<T>`, `Dictionary<string, T>` where T is a supported type that was mentioned before.\n- **Enums**: All enum types.\n\nComplex user-defined types are not supported to keep the API predictable and prevent serialization issues. An exception is thrown at save time if unsupported types are detected.\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n- **Cascading Value vs. Injection:** provide TempData as a cascading value rather than requiring `@inject` in every component. This makes TempData accessible throughout the component tree without explicit injection, similar to how `HttpContext` is provided. Components that don't use TempData don't need to declare it.\n\n- **Cookie as Default:** use cookie storage by default, with session storage as opt-in. This matches MVC TempData behavior for easier migration, works without additional configuration (session requires middleware setup), suitable for most scenarios (flash messages, PRG pattern).\n\n- **Lazy Loading:** only load TempData from storage when first accessed by a component. This avoids unnecessary cookie parsing or session lookups for requests that don't use TempData, improving performance for components that don't need temporary data.\n\n- **Case-Insensitive Keys:** keys are case-insensitive (`TempData[\"message\"]` == `TempData[\"Message\"]`), preventing subtle bugs from casing differences.\n\n### Request Lifecycle Integration\n\nTempData integrates with the request pipeline through:\n\n1. **Automatic Registration**: Registered as a cascading value when `AddRazorComponents()` is called\n2. **Lazy Loading**: Storage access deferred until first use\n3. **Automatic Save**: Values persisted via `Response.OnStarting` callback, ensuring data is saved even if components don't explicitly trigger persistence\n4. **Single Instance**: One TempData instance per request, stored in `HttpContext.Items`\n\nThis design ensures TempData \"just works\" without requiring explicit lifecycle management from developers.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n### No Compile-Time Type Safety\nTempData stores `object?` values, requiring runtime casting: `var name = TempData[\"Name\"] as string`. There's no IntelliSense or type checking, increasing likelihood of runtime errors compared to strongly-typed alternatives.\n\n### Cookie Size Constraints\nThe default cookie storage has a ~4KB browser limit. While chunking helps, developers storing large datasets must switch to session storage, which introduces session affinity requirements.\n\n### Session Storage Complexity\nSession storage requires additional middleware configuration (`AddSession()`, `UseSession()`), distributed cache setup for scaled deployments, and sticky sessions for load balancing. This adds deployment and operational complexity.\n\n## Considered Alternatives\n\nThe alternative that was considered was the `[SupplyParameterFromTempData]` attribute that would have worked similar to the `[SupplyParameterFromQuery]`. It was rejected due to not being robust and flexible enough. This approach did not allow for an easy-to-use `Peek()` and `Keep()` as well as a clear dictionary-like interface.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65039","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TempData design proposal\" (#65039)"},{"Id":"3808407940","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T13:25:40","Actor":"akoeplinger","Number":"65038","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Infrastructure] Updated npm packages 2026-01-12","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65038","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[Infrastructure] Updated npm packages 2026-01-12\" (#65038)"},{"Id":"3808355501","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-13T11:08:40","Actor":"ilonatommy","Number":"65037","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add new `webworker` template item","State":"open","Body":"# `dotnet new webworker` adds a new project with WebWorker support to existing blazor applications\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\n# 1.

Returns `SignInResult.NotAllowed` or `SignInResult.LockedOut` when requirements aren't met.\n\n- **Tests**: Added `CanRequireConfirmedEmailForPasskeySignIn`, `CanRequireConfirmedPhoneNumberForPasskeySignIn`, and `PasskeySignInReturnsLockedOutWhenLockedOut` to verify enforcement.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> ## Problem\n> \n> `SignInManager<TUser>.PasskeySignInAsync()` does not call `PreSignInCheck()` before signing in the user, which means it bypasses sign-in requirements like `RequireConfirmedEmail`, `RequireConfirmedPhoneNumber`, and lockout checks. This is inconsistent with `PasswordSignInAsync()` which correctly enforces these requirements.\n> \n> **Reference Issue:** https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65020\n> \n> ## Current Behavior\n> \n> Looking at `PasskeySignInCoreAsync` in `src/Identity/Core/src/SignInManager.cs`:\n> \n> ```csharp\n> private async Task<SignInResult> PasskeySignInCoreAsync(string credentialJson)\n> {\n>     ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(credentialJson);\n> \n>     var assertionResult = await PerformPasskeyAssertionAsync(credentialJson);\n>     if (!assertionResult.Succeeded)\n>     {\n>         return SignInResult.Failed;\n>     }\n> \n>     // After a successful assertion, we need to update the passkey so that it has the latest\n>     // sign count and authenticator data.\n>     var setPasskeyResult = await UserManager.AddOrUpdatePasskeyAsync(assertionResult.User, assertionResult.Passkey);\n>     if (!setPasskeyResult.Succeeded)\n>     {\n>         return SignInResult.Failed;\n>     }\n> \n>     return await SignInOrTwoFactorAsync(assertionResult.User, isPersistent: false, bypassTwoFactor: true);\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> The method directly proceeds to `SignInOrTwoFactorAsync` without calling `PreSignInCheck()`.\n> \n> ## Expected Behavior\n> \n> `PasskeySignInAsync()` should call `PreSignInCheck()` after successful passkey assertion (but before signing in) to enforce:\n> - `RequireConfirmedEmail` - returns `SignInResult.NotAllowed` if email is not confirmed\n> - `RequireConfirmedPhoneNumber` - returns `SignInResult.NotAllowed` if phone is not confirmed  \n> - User lockout - returns `SignInResult.LockedOut` if user is locked out\n> \n> ## Required Changes\n> \n> ### 1. Modify `PasskeySignInCoreAsync` in `src/Identity/Core/src/SignInManager.cs`\n> \n> Add a call to `PreSignInCheck()` after successful passkey assertion, similar to how `TwoFactorAuthenticatorSignInCoreAsync` and `TwoFactorSignInCoreAsync` do it:\n> \n> ```csharp\n> private async Task<SignInResult> PasskeySignInCoreAsync(string credentialJson)\n> {\n>     ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(credentialJson);\n> \n>     var assertionResult = await PerformPasskeyAssertionAsync(credentialJson);\n>     if (!assertionResult.Succeeded)\n>     {\n>         return SignInResult.Failed;\n>     }\n> \n>     // Check pre-sign-in requirements (email confirmation, phone confirmation, lockout)\n>     var error = await PreSignInCheck(assertionResult.User);\n>     if (error != null)\n>     {\n>         return error;\n>     }\n> \n>     // After a successful assertion, we need to update the passkey so that it has the latest\n>     // sign count and authenticator data.\n>     var setPasskeyResult = await UserManager.AddOrUpdatePasskeyAsync(assertionResult.User, assertionResult.Passkey);\n>     if (!setPasskeyResult.Succeeded)\n>     {\n>         return SignInResult.Failed;\n>     }\n> \n>     return await SignInOrTwoFactorAsync(assertionResult.User, isPersistent: false, bypassTwoFactor: true);\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> ### 2. Add unit tests in `src/Identity/test/Identity.Test/SignInManagerTest.cs`\n> \n> Add the following test methods that mirror the existing password sign-in tests:\n> \n> #### Test 1: `CanRequireConfirmedEmailForPasskeySignIn`\n> Similar to `CanRequireConfirmedEmailForPasswordSignIn`, this test should verify that when `RequireConfirmedEmail = true`:\n> - If email is NOT confirmed → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.NotAllowed`\n> - If email IS confirmed → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.Success`\n> \n> #### Test 2: `CanRequireConfirmedPhoneNumberForPasskeySignIn`\n> Similar to `CanRequireConfirmedPhoneNumberForPasswordSignIn`, this test should verify that when `RequireConfirmedPhoneNumber = true`:\n> - If phone is NOT confirmed → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.NotAllowed`\n> - If phone IS confirmed → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.Success`\n> \n> #### Test 3: `PasskeySignInReturnsLockedOutWhenLockedOut`\n> Similar to `PasswordSignInReturnsLockedOutWhenLockedOut`, this test should verify that:\n> - If user is locked out → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.LockedOut`\n> \n> For reference, the existing `CanPasskeySignIn` test in the same file shows how to set up passkey sign-in tests with mocked `IPasskeyHandler`. Use similar setup patterns for the new tests.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n*This pull request was created from Copilot chat.*\n>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65024","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix PasskeySignInAsync to enforce email/phone confirmation and lockout checks\" (#65024)"},{"Id":"3805073562","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T16:31:43","Actor":"HeinziAT","Number":"65023","RawContent":null,"Title":"Modified .NET 9+ QuickGrid rendering behavior is not documented as a breaking change","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn .NET 9, the behavior of the QuickGrid changed: When using a paginator, empty rows are now rendered differently than before.

Configure ASP.NET Core Identity with `RequireConfirmedEmail = true`:\n`builder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => { options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedEmail = true; })`\n2.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For more information, visit https://aka.ms/aspnet/deprecate/004.\n\nUsing `IWebHost` or `WebHost` will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID **ASPDEPR008**:\n> warning ASPDEPR008: WebHost is obsolete. Use HostBuilder or WebApplicationBuilder instead.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy. Or authentication to fail if using TLS termination and expecting an https request.\n\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe change was made for security hardening, as the proxy and IP lists weren't being applied in all cases.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n- **Review your deployment topology:**  \n  Ensure that all legitimate proxy servers in front of your app are properly added to `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` in your `ForwardedHeadersOptions` configuration.\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownProxies = { IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_PROXY_IP\") }\n  });\n  ```\n  Or, for a network:\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownNetworks = { new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_NETWORK_IP\"), PREFIX_LENGTH) }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **If you wish to enable previous behavior:**  \n  You may need to relax your configuration, but this is **not recommended** due to security risks. You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

However, when you switch your ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT to \"Production\", you lose the {appname}.style.css file (you get a 404) so the styling is all gone (along with the menu, etc.)\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n[Code Repo](https://github.com/TimCorey/BlazorApp10)\r\n\r\n1. Create a Blazor Server (.NET 5) Project\r\n2. Set the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT variable to \"Production\" in launchSettings.json for IIS Express (or Kestrel)\r\n3.

Although optimized in size, it is a heap allocation with an intermediary buffer.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static string BuildAbsolute(\r\n    string scheme,\r\n    HostString host,\r\n    PathString pathBase = new PathString(),\r\n    PathString path = new PathString(),\r\n    QueryString query = new QueryString(),\r\n    FragmentString fragment = new FragmentString())\r\n{\r\n    if (scheme == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(scheme));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var combinedPath = (pathBase.HasValue || path.HasValue) ?

There are also time improvements in those cases, but it's wrost in the other cases.\r\n\r\n## String_Concat_WithArrayArgument\r\n\r\nGiven that the final URL is composed of more than 4 parts, the use of `string.Concat` incurs in an array allocation.\r\n\r\nBut it still always performs better in terms of time and memory usage that using a `StringBuilder`.\r\n\r\n## String_Create\r\n\r\n`string.Create` excels here in comparison to all the other options. It was created exactly for these use cases.\r\n\r\n# Benchmarks\r\n\r\n``` ini\r\n\r\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.12.1, OS=Windows 10.0.21277\r\nIntel Core i7-8650U CPU 1.90GHz (Kaby Lake R), 1 CPU, 8 logical

components to create the final URL.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static string BuildRelative(\r\n    PathString pathBase = new PathString(),\r\n    PathString path = new PathString(),\r\n    QueryString query = new QueryString(),\r\n    FragmentString fragment = new FragmentString())\r\n{\r\n    string combinePath = (pathBase.HasValue || path.HasValue) ? (pathBase + path).ToString() : \"/\";\r\n    return combinePath + query.ToString() + fragment.ToString();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\nThis method is frequently use in hot paths like redirect and rewrite rules.\r\n\r\n# Detailed design\r\n\r\n## Single_Concat\r\nGiven that the final URL is composed of only 3 or 4 parts, the use of `string.Concat` is both time and memory efficient.\r\n\r\n## String_Create\r\n`string.Create` could be used. But it's just as memory efficient as `string.Concat` and less time efficient is most cases.\r\n\r\n# Benchmarks\r\n\r\n``` ini\r\n\r\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.12.1, OS=Windows 10.0.21277\r\nIntel Core

","State":"open","Body":"#### Description\r\nKestrel refuses requests with a 400 error if they contain both a `Connection: Upgrade` header and a request body. The RFCs allow this combination, but you must consume the request body before the upgrade can be completed. See https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/17081#issuecomment-726300552 for details.\r\n\r\nThis change ignores the `Connection: Upgrade` header if there's a request body so it will be processed as a normal HTTP request. This change does not fully support upgrades from requests with bodies (e.g. HTTP/2 upgrades), but that scenario is extremely uncommon.\r\n\r\nContributes to #17081, backport of #27921 from 6.0.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n#17081 catalogs many customer reported compatibility issues when using Kestrel with common nginx configurations, causing any request with a body to be refused. In some cases they're able to reconfigure nginx to avoid the issue, but for others it is an adoption blocker (e.g. they don't control the nginx config).\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\nYes, in 2.0.\r\n\t\t\r\n#### Risk\r\nLow.\r\n\t\t\r\n#### Packaging changes reviewed?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n3.1: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/28907\r\n2.1: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/28908","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/28896","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[5.0] Allow/ignore upgrades with bodies \" (#28896)"},{"Id":"775634999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-29T00:08:10","Actor":"teo-tsirpanis","Number":"28895","RawContent":null,"Title":"Optimize the SocketAwaitableEventArgs class.","State":"open","Body":"This PR does two things to Kestrel's `SocketAwaitableEventArgs` class:\r\n - It eliminates a lambda allocation by caching the `Action` passed to the `PipeScheduler` at the overriden `OnCompleted` method (a pretty hot path).\r\n - It changes the `I(Critical)Completion` methods to behave like `ValueTaskAwaiter` when the operation is already completed. Most importantly, the synchronization context is explicitly not captured and the implementations of `OnCompleted` and `UnsafeOnCompleted` now actually differ.\r\n\r\nI have some reservations about the second change. Perhaps it is made redundant by the `unsafeSuppressExecutionContextFlow` parameter at the constructor, and the longer method call adds an overhead; I am not 100% sure.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/28895","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Optimize the SocketAwaitableEventArgs class.\" (#28895)"},{"Id":"775634597","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-29T00:06:07","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"28894","RawContent":null,"Title":"[SignalR] Ignore ODE with AsyncEnumerables","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/28241","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/28894","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[SignalR] Ignore ODE with AsyncEnumerables\" (#28894)"},{"Id":"775622740","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-28T23:14:07","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"28893","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove obsolete StaticFileResponseContext constructor ","State":"open","Body":"#27529\r\n\r\nObsolete APIs in Middleware:\r\n- StaticFileResponseContext.ctor(): Obsolete since 3.0, and wasn't usable before that because all of the properties had internal setters.

The only problem with the current css isolation is if you use custom css and pass the class to another component, does not work in most cases.  An example can be if there is a component that has css isolation and you specify a class and use a telerik component that has a property for class.  in that case, the telerik component will not show the custom css at all unless you use standard css which requires the reference.  I like how javascript isolation works where you specify in the class library and anybody that uses it does not have to do any extra setup.  There are many cases where somebody may create custom css classes in a razor class library and want to reuse without having to do extra setup but instead of isolated to just a component is making it more like standard css but a person does not have to reference like javascript isolation works.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/28882","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improvement to css isolation\" (#28882)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

All breaking changes to nullability annotations will be aggregated into this issue throughout the course of .NET 6.0.**_\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0, we have been applying nullability annotations to parts of ASP.NET Core. From the outset of this effort, [we anticipated that mistakes would be made](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/api-guidelines/nullability.md#breaking-change-guidance) in these annotations and fixes would need to be made. In .NET 6.0, we are updating some annotations that have been previously applied. Some of these changes are considered source breaking changes because it leads to the APIs being incompatible or more restrictive, or could result in build-time warnings when used in projects that have nullable reference types enabled.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27564 for further discussions.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe affected APIs had incorrect nullable reference type annotations and build warnings were either absent or incorrect.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNew build warnings will be produced and incorrect build warnings will no longer be produced for the affected APIs.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThrough feedback and further testing, the nullable annotations for the affected APIs were determined to be inaccurate. The updated annotations now correctly represent the nullability contracts for the APIs.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nUpdate code calling these APIs to reflect the revised nullability contracts.\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [ParameterView.FromDictionary(IDictionary<string,

For example, if a razor class library defined a static web asset to be served under `/folder/file.txt` and the host placed a file under `wwwroot/folder/file.txt` the file on the server would silently override the file on the Razor Class Library or Blazor Webassembly application.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core will now correctly detect when this issue happens and inform of the conflict so that users can be aware and take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis was a bug in the implementation, we never intended for static web assets to be \"overridable\" by files on the wwwroot host of the project since that leads to errors that are hard to diagnose and can result in undefined behavior changes when applications are published.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason for a file on a Razor Class Library to conflict with a file on the host by default since they are prefixed with `_content/${PackageId}` unless we are discussing Blazor Webassembly applications, which get placed by default at the root of the host url space, which makes conflicts easier. (For example, Blazor Webassembly Applications contain a favicon.ico that the host might also include in their wwwroot folder).\r\n\r\nIf the source of the conflict is a file in a Razor Class Library it normally means there is some code that copies the assets from the library into the wwwroot folder of the project. We don't recommend developers doing that since it defeats one of the main goals of static web assets which is that files don't have to be copied around, which is fundamental to get updates on the browser when the contents are updated without having to trigger a new compilation.\r\n\r\nIf despite that you want to preserve this behavior and maintain the file on the host, you can do so by removing the file from the list of static web assets with a custom MSBuild target.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the file on the razor class library or the blazor webassembly file instead of the file from the host project, just remove the file from the host project.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updated validation logic for Static Web Assets\" (#443)"},{"Id":"724794249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T19:05:24","Actor":"tatti9018","Number":"442","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"Help with feature “Control Startup class activation”\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n            .ConfigureWebHost(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.UseStartup(context => new Startup(logger));\r\n            })\r\n            .Build();\r\n```\r\nWhen I use Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly”, I get error: ‘IHostBuilder’ does not contain a definition for ‘ConfigureWebHostDefaults’\r\nWhen I set Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, project see ConfigureWebHostDefaults, but project doesn’t work….","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/442","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work\" (#442)"},{"Id":"712253766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-30T20:21:51","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5","State":"open","Body":"## Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5\r\n\r\n.NET 5 introduces a variety of [new Blazor features](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514), some of which are not compatible with certain older browsers.

Starting from ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1, all of those readonly public fields have changed to readonly public properties.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect this change to affect many developers because:\r\n\r\n * Any application or library that simply uses `.razor` files (or even manual `RenderTreeBuilder` calls) to define its components would not be referencing this type directly\r\n * The `RenderTreeFrame` type itself is regarded as an implementation detail, not intended for use outside the framework. ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later includes an analyzer that issues compiler warnings if the type is being used directly.\r\n * Even if you do reference `RenderTreeFrame` directly, this change is binary-breaking but not source-breaking. That is, your existing source code will still compile and behave properly. You will only encounter an issue if compiling against the 3.x framework and then running those binaries against the 5.0 RC1 and later framework.\r\n\r\n## Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1\r\n\r\n## Old behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` were defined as fields, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\n## New behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` are defined as properties with the same names as before, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\nIf older precompiled code has not been recompiled since this change, it may throw an exception similar to *MissingFieldException: Field not found: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame.FrameType'*.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary in order to implement some high-impact performance improvements in Blazor component rendering on ASP.NET Core 5.0 while retaining the same level of safety and encapsulation as before.\r\n\r\n## Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Blazor developers will not be affected and do not need to take action. This is most likely to affect library/package authors, but still only rarely. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* If you are developing an application, and either staying on ASP.NET Core 3.x or upgrading to 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to make any changes to your own code.\r\n   * However if you depend on a library that needs to upgrade to account for this change, then you would need to update to a newer version of that library.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support only ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to take any action. Just ensure that your `csproj` declares the `TargetFramework` value `net5.0`.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support both ASP.NET Core 3.x *and* 5.0, then check whether or not your code attempts to read any of the members of `RenderTreeFrame` (for example, evaluating `someRenderTreeFrame.FrameType`).\r\n    * Most libraries will not do that. This includes libraries that contain `.razor` components. In this case you don't need to take any action.\r\n    * However, if your library does do that, then you will need to use multitargeting to support both `netstandard2.1` and `net5.0`. First, in your `csproj`, replace the existing `<TargetFramework>` with `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`. Then instead of referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` with a fixed version number such as 3.0.0, use a conditional reference to account for both versions you wish to support. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"3.0.0\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"5.0.0-rc.1.*\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' != 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further clarification, see this [diff showing how @jsakamoto already upgraded his `Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement` library in this way](https://github.com/jsakamoto/Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement/commit/090df430ba725f9420d412753db8104e8c32bf51).\r\n\r\n## Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fields on RenderTreeFrame have become properties\" (#438)"},{"Id":"696062913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T17:46:46","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

In 5.0-rc1, the feature was available as part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ProtectedBrowserStorage package which references the Microsoft.AspNetCore.App shared framework. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nAs part of 5.0-rc2, a package reference is no longer needed to reference and use the feature.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nBetter fit for the user experience we expect.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\n#### When upgrading from 5.0-rc1\r\n\r\n* Remove the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ProtectedBrowserStorage` package reference \r\n* Replace the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ProtectedBrowserStorage` using with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.ProtectedBrowserStorage`\r\n* Remove the call to `AddProtectedBrowserStorage` from your Startup.\r\n\r\n#### When upgrading from 5.0-preview8\r\n\r\n* Remove the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Extensions` package reference \r\n* Replace the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Extensions` using with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.ProtectedBrowserStorage`\r\n* Remove the call to `AddProtectedBrowserStorage` from your Startup.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ProtectedBrowserStorage\r\n* Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ProtectedBrowserStorageServiceCollectionExtensions.AddProtectedBrowserStorage\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/436","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ProtectedBrowserStorage feature moved to ASP.NET Core shared framework\" (#436)"},{"Id":"691459306","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-02T22:03:50","Actor":"MackinnonBuck","Number":"435","RawContent":null,"Title":"JSObjectReference has been made internal, and IJSObjectReference takes its place in the public API","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis issue template is for use in opening issues that document breaking changes.

For example:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar jsObjectReference = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync<JSObjectReference>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n`JSObjectReference` will be made `internal`, so the new `IJSObjectReference` type must be used instead:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar jsObjectReference = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also applies for `JSInProcessObjectReference`, which was replaced by `IJSInProcessObjectReference`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe change makes this feature more consistent with other patterns within Blazor. `IJSObjectReference` is analogous to `IJSRuntime` in that it serves a similar purpose and has similar methods and extensions.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nReplace all occurrences of `JSObjectReference` and `JSInProcessObjectReference` with `IJSObjectReference` and `IJSInProcessObjectReference` in your code.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.JSInterop.JSObjectReference`\r\n`Microsoft.JSInterop.JSInProcessObjectReference`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf no APIs are affected, this should read:\r\n     \"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n  If affected APIs are identifiable, include a link for each.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the default behavior of `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBy default, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found (i.e. the exception handler returns a 404) when the middleware executes. To allow 404 responses to be returned by the exception handler, please configure the option `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. When this option is set to true, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run. The exception thrown will be handled by the server. For example, the exception will be converted to a 500 error response by Kestrel HTTP server or HTTP.SYS server. \r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility using the current behavior, where a 404 response from the exception handler is allowed, please set `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`.

So, starting with .NET 5 preview 7, the `.razor` compiler will omit insignificant whitespace by default.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, this will not have any effect on the visual layout of the rendered component, since the whitespace nodes being removed would not normally affect it. However, the whitespace might affect the rendered output if you are using a CSS rule like `white-space: pre`. If you need to preserve the whitespace, you can use the new directive `@preservewhitespace true` at the top of your `.razor` file, or inside an `_Imports.razor` file to apply the preference to an entire subdirectory or even your whole project.\r\n\r\nFor further discussions, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23568\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following `.razor` code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n    @foreach (var item in Items)\r\n    {\r\n        <li>\r\n            @item.Text\r\n        </li>\r\n    }\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would previously have rendered two whitespace nodes outside the `@foreach`, and then two more around the `<li>`, and then two more around `@item.Text`. If the list contained 100 items, this would have been 402 whitespace nodes - i.e., more than half of all nodes rendered, even though none of them would visually affect the rendered output. Eliminating them at compile time greatly improves performance for rendering and diffing.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes were preserved\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes are removed if:\r\n\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within an element\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within a `RenderFragment` parameter (e.g., child content being passed to another component)\r\n * ... they precede or follow a C# code block such as an `@if`, `@foreach`, etc.\r\n\r\n... except if the `@preservewhitespace` directive is used with value `true`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nPerformance.

This is available starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 \r\n- A set of ciphers compatible with HTTP/2. THis is available starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\nAs such, Kestrel's behavior when HTTP/2 over TLS is configured has been changed to:\r\n- Downgrade to `Http1` and log a message at the `Information` level when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http1AndHttp2`. Note this is the default value for `ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`.\r\n- Throw a `NotSupportedException` when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http2`.\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 are considered as incompatible since they don't have the necessary ciphers by default, it is possible to update the Computer Configuration settings to use HTTP/2 compatible ciphers, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-8-1).

To learn more about how to configure Kestrel using appsettings.json, see the appsettings.json example in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel#endpoint-configuration.\r\n\r\nKestrel will bind, unbind and rebind endpoints as necessary to react to these configuration changes.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0.0-preview7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPrior to 5.0.0-preview6, Kestrel did not support changing config at runtime.\r\n\r\nIn 5.0.0-preview6, you could opt into the now-default behavior of reacting to configuration changes at runtime by binding Kestrel's configuration manually as follows:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nwebHostBuilder.UseKestrel((builderContext, kestrelOptions) =>\r\n{\r\n    kestrelOptions.Configure(builderContext.Configuration.GetSection(\"Kestrel\"), reloadOnChange: true);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nKestrel now reacts to configuration changes at runtime by default.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nTo support reconfiguring endpoints at runtime without completely restarting the server.

I can't imagine why anybody would want to override the null check of a Blazor parameter without requiring it to be set when the component is used.\n\nThe code fix may not work as intended for all people. Some other analyzers (ex: StyleCop) enforce preferences about whether or not to keep both attributes on one line, or split them into two lines. However, this seems minor, since they can do another code fix with the other analyzer for the attribute preferences. I suggest the code fix adds the attribute on a separate line by default, since it's better in git diffs.\n\nOverall, this proposed solution reduces risks, since it reduces the risk of runtime NullReferenceExceptions in Blazor apps.\n\n<!--\nPlease mention any risks that to your knowledge the API proposal might entail, such as breaking changes, performance regressions, etc.\n-->\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62096","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor Analyzer/code fix: Add EditorRequiredAttribute to Blazor parameter when using null forgiving operator\" (#62096)"},{"Id":"3088513533","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-24T14:29:23","Actor":"mikekistler","Number":"62095","RawContent":null,"Title":"Inconsistencies in parameter binding between Minimal APIs, AoT, and Controllers","State":"open","Body":"There are some subtle differences in parameter binding between Minimal APIs, Minimal APIs compiled for AoT, and Controller-based APIs.\n\nIn particular, the way nullability and the RequiredAttribute are handled varies, as well as how these are represented in the generated OpenAPI.\n\nI created a project that explores the combinations of nullability and required for both value and ref params:\n\nhttps://github.com/mikekistler/aspnet-param-binding\n\nI ran tests and summarized the results in the [README.md](https://github.com/mikekistler/aspnet-param-binding/blob/main/README.md). My analysis of these results follows.\n\n### OpenAPI required\n\n- Minimal APIs (AoT or not)  set `required: true` if the parameter has the `Required` attribute _or_ if the parameter is not nullable.\n- Controllers set `required: true` only if the parameter has the `Required` attribute.\n\nI think Minimal APIs should adopt the behavior of Controllers to make these consistent.\n\n### Handling of omitted param\n\n- Minimal APIs (AoT or not) appear to treat an omitted parameter as having a `null` value, and fail the request if the parameter is either required or non-nullable.\n- Controllers appear to treat omitted parameters differently for value vs reference types:\n  - For value types, an omitted parameter appears to be treated as having the default value for the type\n  - For reference types, an omitted parameter appears to be treated as having a `null` value, whether or not the type is nullable.\n\nI think Minimal APIs should fail a request where a parameter with the `Required` attribute is omitted, and otherwise set the parameter to its default value.\n\nTo achieve full consistency between Minimal APIs and Controllers, Controllers should treat omitted parameters as having their default value -- so the empty string rather than null in the case of a non-nullable string parameter. But this is likely a breaking change so maybe something to avoid.\n\n### Handling of empty param value\n\n- Minimal APIs handle empty values differently for AoT and non-AoT scenarios:\n  - Minimal APIs without AoT appear to treat an empty value as being an empty string, and fails if it cannot assign an empty string to the param (as in the case of the value param).\n  - Minimal APIs with AoT appear to treat an empty value as being the default value for the type.\n- Controllers appear to treat an empty value as if the parameter's value was \"null\".  As a result, it returns 400 if param is not nullable, or if param is required, and otherwise sets it to null.\n\nI think Minimal APIs without AoT should change to be consistent with AoT and treat an empty value as being the default value for the type.\n\nThis does not resolve the inconsistency between Minimal APIs and Controllers, but that's probably not fixable without a breaking change to Controllers.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62095","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Inconsistencies in parameter binding between Minimal APIs, AoT, and Controllers\" (#62095)"},{"Id":"3087835994","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-24T01:04:28","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"62094","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0-preview5] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"open","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

implementation","State":"open","Body":"This PR implements a runtime-based `IValidatableTypeInfoResolver` to enable minimal-API validation when the source-generator path is unavailable (e.g., dynamic compilation, IDEs without generators, or environments where generators are turned off).\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Core Implementation\n- **Added `RuntimeValidatableTypeInfoResolver.cs`** - A reflection-based resolver that discovers validatable types at runtime\n- **Added `RuntimeValidatableTypeInfo`** - Runtime implementation extending `ValidatableTypeInfo`  \n- **Added `RuntimeValidatablePropertyInfo`** - Runtime implementation extending `ValidatablePropertyInfo`\n\n### Key Features\n- **Reflection-based discovery**: Walks public instance properties recursively to build validation info\n- **Performance optimization**: Uses `ConcurrentDictionary<Type, IValidatableInfo?>` to cache results \n- **Cycle detection**: Tracks visited types with `HashSet<Type>` to prevent infinite recursion\n- **Consistent filtering**: Uses same type filtering logic as existing `RuntimeValidatableParameterInfoResolver`\n- **Thread-safe**: All caches are static and use thread-safe concurrent collections\n\n### Integration\n- **Updated `ValidationServiceCollectionExtensions`** to register the new resolver after parameter resolver but before any user-added resolvers\n- **Added comprehensive unit tests** covering basic functionality, caching, nested types, and cycle detection\n\n### Example Usage\n```csharp\n// This now works at runtime without source generators\npublic class Person\n{\n    [Required]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    \n    [Range(0, 120)]\n    public int Age { get; set; }\n    \n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Address  \n{\n    [Required]\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n}\n\n// Validation will discover and validate the nested Address properties automatically\napp.MapPost(\"/person\", (Person person) => Results.Ok());\n```\n\nThe implementation ensures that compile-time generated resolvers take precedence when available, while providing a robust fallback for runtime scenarios.\n\nFixes #61220.\n\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model

This is to support using those tags when making sampling decisions as only tags provided in the `CreateActivity`/`StartActivity` are available at that time.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nImplementations of `IHttpActivityCreationTagsFeature` can determine what tags are desired to be used for sampling. It's important that this is an opt-in where the user specifies the tags to add since this work will get done for every Activity created for an incoming request and not just for the ones that eventually pass the sampling filter.\r\n\r\nExample implementation:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class BasicHttpActivityCreationTagsFeature : IHttpActivityCreationTagsFeature\r\n{\r\n    private readonly HttpContext _context;\r\n\r\n    public BasicHttpActivityCreationTagsFeature(HttpContext context)\r\n    {\r\n        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(context);\r\n        _context = context;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, object?>>?

to separate package","State":"open","Body":"This PR moves the validation APIs from the Http.Abstractions package to a new `Microsoft.Extensions.Validation` package to support using the unified resolver APIs in more scenarios.\n\nThe changes include:\n\n- Created new directory structure:\n  - `src/Validation/src` for the core library\n  - `src/Validation/test/Microsoft.Extensions.Validation.Tests` for tests\n  - `src/Validation/gen` for the source generator\n  - `src/Validation/test/Microsoft.Extensions.Validation.ValidationsGenerator.Tests` for generator tests\n\n- Moved validation source files and updated namespaces:\n  - Changed from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Validation` to `Microsoft.Extensions.Validation`\n  - Maintained the same API contracts and functionality\n\n- Added type forwarders to maintain backward compatibility:\n  - Added forwarding for all validation types in Http.Abstractions\n  - Added forwarding for the validations generator to the new implementation\n\n- Created appropriately structured project files with dependencies\n- Updated project references and configuration\n\nThis change supports better modularity by decoupling validation logic from the HTTP abstractions, allowing it to be used more broadly in other scenarios while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\nFixes #62070.\n\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

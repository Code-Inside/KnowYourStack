We have a process to evaluate the value and shape of new API. There is an overview of our process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/APIReviewProcess.md). This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\r\nFirst, please describe the purpose and value of the new API here.\r\n-->\r\nNot sure if this is really an API proposal, but it was the only issue template that made sense to me. \r\n\r\nI noticed [FileMultipartSection.FileStream](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Http/WebUtilities/src/FileMultipartSection.cs#L55) is marked as a Nullable Stream, but [MultipartSection.Body](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Http/WebUtilities/src/MultipartSection.cs#L52) Stream is not Nullable. It looks like `FileMultipartSection.FileStream` is only set from the `MultipartSection.Body` so I would assume that both would have the same Nullable reference type. My only thought is that `MultipartSection.Body` has a public setter so it \"could\" be set to null, but if so then `FileMultipartSection.FileStream` should be null too.

I could be looking at this wrong so I apolgize.\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease mention any risks that to your knowledge the API proposal might entail, such as breaking changes, performance regressions, etc.\r\n-->\r\nCould add warnings / errors to existing code that uses the Nullable feature if the change was to `Stream` and not `Stream?`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39966","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FileMultipartSection.FileStream and MultipartSection.Body Nullability Differences\" (#39966)"},{"Id":"1122439910","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-03T18:40:54","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"39944","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fire an event when allowing a bad request ","State":"closed","Body":"# Fire an event when allowing a bad request \r\n\r\nThis adds diagnostics for a prior fix so partners can determine when the client issues have been addressed.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/39334 from Feb allowed a partner to opt into accepting a specific kind of bad request.

I see that the change was introduced with aspnetcore 2.2.3, I just don't understand why (I am sorry if it is not a bug) But if it is not a bug, then maybe the logic in the OutputFormatter could be changed so that CanWriteResult of a formatter for application/hal+json returns false for application/json.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue if you have 2 different formatters for application/hal+json and application/json because CanWriteResult of the formatter for application/json now returns true for application/hal+json and it uses this formatter instead of the other one.\r\n\r\nI think that there would be other people who would expect it to return false (as it was). See this issue - \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/8469 - the problem there was that they made their own implementation which was wrong because it was only looking at the content type of the request, but still they were expecting that CanWriteResult of the output formatter would return false (in aspnetcore 2.2.3+ it will return true even if they fixed their issue with the content type)\r\n\r\nWith this change in  MediaType we would have to override CanWriteResult and explicitly check for application/hal+json so that we can keep both formatters.\r\n\r\nThis is the relevant code in aspnetcore 2.1 (we fall in the last \"else\")(https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/2.1.0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/Formatters/MediaType.cs):\r\n```\r\nprivate bool MatchesSubtype(MediaType set)\r\n        {\r\n            if (set.MatchesAllSubTypes)\r\n            {\r\n                return true;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (set.SubTypeSuffix.HasValue)\r\n            {\r\n                if (SubTypeSuffix.HasValue)\r\n                {\r\n                    // Both the set and the media type being checked have suffixes, so both parts must match.\r\n                    return MatchesSubtypeWithoutSuffix(set) && MatchesSubtypeSuffix(set);\r\n                }\r\n                else\r\n                {\r\n                    // The set has a suffix, but the media type being checked doesn't. We never consider this to match.\r\n                    return false;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                // The set has no suffix, so we're just looking for an exact match (which means that if 'this'\r\n                // has a suffix, it won't match).\r\n                return set.SubType.Equals(SubType, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is in aspnetcore 6 (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Mvc/Mvc.Core/src/Formatters/MediaType.cs):\r\n```\r\n  private bool MatchesSubtype(ReadOnlyMediaTypeHeaderValue set)\r\n    {\r\n        if (set.MatchesAllSubTypes)\r\n        {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (set.SubTypeSuffix.HasValue)\r\n        {\r\n            if (SubTypeSuffix.HasValue)\r\n            {\r\n                // Both the set and the media type being checked have suffixes, so both parts must match.\r\n                return MatchesSubtypeWithoutSuffix(set) && MatchesSubtypeSuffix(set);\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                // The set has a suffix, but the media type being checked doesn't.

In MvcOptions add an output formatter for application/hal+json and then another for application/json.\r\n2. make a request with accept:application/json.\r\n3. the result will be formatted by the first ( application/hal+json) formatter instead of the second one (application/json).\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n.NET 6\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39959","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"MediaType.IsSubsetOf returns true for application/hal+json and application/json\" (#39959)"},{"Id":"1123065284","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-03T13:07:04","Actor":"palmej2","Number":"39958","RawContent":null,"Title":"System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: 'The payload was invalid.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`.

The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

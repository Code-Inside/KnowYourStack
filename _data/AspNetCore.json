When searching for solution files with the `*.sln` pattern, the method now falls back to searching for `.slnx` files if no `.sln` file is found, preventing the `InvalidOperationException` that would previously occur before test developers can easily call `UseSolutionRelativeContentRoot` themselves.\r\n\r\nThis has already been fixed in .NET 10 by #61305, but that included public API changes, so this is not a direct backport. Unlike, the .NET 10 change that treats `.slnx` and `.sln` equivalently by default, this change will only fall back to looking for an `*.slnx` file if the test server would otherwise throw an `InvalidOperationException` due to not being able to find an \".sln\" file.\r\n\r\nFixes #61304 in .NET 8.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\n#61304 has gotten a lot of attention, because it is a pain point for migrating solution from `.sln` to `.slnx`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException : Solution root could not be located using application root C:\\Project\\Path\\bin\\Debug\\net9.0\\\r\n\r\nStack Trace:\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost.WebHostBuilderExtensions.UseSolutionRelativeContentRoot(IWebHostBuilder builder, String solutionRelativePath, String applicationBasePath, String solutionName)\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost.WebHostBuilderExtensions.UseSolutionRelativeContentRoot(IWebHostBuilder builder, String solutionRelativePath, String solutionName)\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1.SetContentRoot(IWebHostBuilder builder)\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1.<ConfigureHostBuilder>b__22_0(IWebHostBuilder webHostBuilder)\r\n at Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.GenericHostWebHostBuilderExtensions.ConfigureWebHost(IHostBuilder builder, Func`3 createWebHostBuilder, Action`1 configure, Action`1 configureWebHostBuilder)\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1.ConfigureHostBuilder(IHostBuilder hostBuilder)\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1.EnsureServer()\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1.CreateDefaultClient(DelegatingHandler[] handlers)\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1.CreateDefaultClient(Uri baseAddress, DelegatingHandler[] handlers)\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1.CreateClient(WebApplicationFactoryClientOptions options)\r\n at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1.CreateClient()\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest projects that worked fine with an `.sln`-based solution throw after migrating to `*.slnx` before developers even get access to the `IWebHostBuilder`, so they don't get the opportunity to easily manually reconfigure the content root by calling `UseSolutionRelativeContentRoot` with \"*.slnx\".

Add unit tests in `src/Identity/test/Identity.Test/SignInManagerTest.cs`\n> \n> Add the following test methods that mirror the existing password sign-in tests:\n> \n> #### Test 1: `CanRequireConfirmedEmailForPasskeySignIn`\n> Similar to `CanRequireConfirmedEmailForPasswordSignIn`, this test should verify that when `RequireConfirmedEmail = true`:\n> - If email is NOT confirmed → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.NotAllowed`\n> - If email IS confirmed → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.Success`\n> \n> #### Test 2: `CanRequireConfirmedPhoneNumberForPasskeySignIn`\n> Similar to `CanRequireConfirmedPhoneNumberForPasswordSignIn`, this test should verify that when `RequireConfirmedPhoneNumber = true`:\n> - If phone is NOT confirmed → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.NotAllowed`\n> - If phone IS confirmed → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.Success`\n> \n> #### Test 3: `PasskeySignInReturnsLockedOutWhenLockedOut`\n> Similar to `PasswordSignInReturnsLockedOutWhenLockedOut`, this test should verify that:\n> - If user is locked out → `PasskeySignInAsync` returns `SignInResult.LockedOut`\n> \n> For reference, the existing `CanPasskeySignIn` test in the same file shows how to set up passkey sign-in tests with mocked `IPasskeyHandler`. Use similar setup patterns for the new tests.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n*This pull request was created from Copilot chat.*\n>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65024","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix PasskeySignInAsync to enforce email/phone confirmation and lockout checks\" (#65024)"},{"Id":"3802775757","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T16:58:07","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"65012","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/extensions","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:11a4fe08-b74d-4c15-1004-08dcbc30275f)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/extensions\n- **Subscription**: [11a4fe08-b74d-4c15-1004-08dcbc30275f](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=11a4fe08-b74d-4c15-1004-08dcbc30275f)\n- **Build**: [20260108.2](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2874845) ([296460](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/3883/github:dotnet:extensions/build/296460))\n- **Date Produced**: January 8, 2026 7:31:29 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [99383237b2b86d4d85b4f5908b938e9e43c97db7](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/commit/99383237b2b86d4d85b4f5908b938e9e43c97db7)\n- **Branch**: [main](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/tree/main)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Dependency Updates**:\n  - From [10.2.0-preview.1.25619.5 to 10.3.0-preview.1.26058.2][1]\n     - Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Testing\n     - Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/compare/a4a3d809e9...99383237b2\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:11a4fe08-b74d-4c15-1004-08dcbc30275f)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65012","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/9.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/extensions\" (#65012)"},{"Id":"3802776630","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T16:58:00","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"65013","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/extensions","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ea09839e-ece1-4cb6-b798-cd2130f3225c)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/extensions\n- **Subscription**: [ea09839e-ece1-4cb6-b798-cd2130f3225c](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=ea09839e-ece1-4cb6-b798-cd2130f3225c)\n- **Build**: [20260108.2](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2874845) ([296460](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/3883/github:dotnet:extensions/build/296460))\n- **Date Produced**: January 8, 2026 7:31:29 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [99383237b2b86d4d85b4f5908b938e9e43c97db7](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/commit/99383237b2b86d4d85b4f5908b938e9e43c97db7)\n- **Branch**: [main](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/tree/main)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Dependency Updates**:\n  - From [10.2.0-preview.1.25619.5 to 10.3.0-preview.1.26058.2][1]\n     - Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Hybrid\n     - Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Testing\n     - Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/compare/a4a3d809e9...99383237b2\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:ea09839e-ece1-4cb6-b798-cd2130f3225c)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65013","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/10.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/extensions\" (#65013)"},{"Id":"3805073562","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-12T16:31:43","Actor":"HeinziAT","Number":"65023","RawContent":null,"Title":"Modified .NET 9+ QuickGrid rendering behavior is not documented as a breaking change","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn .NET 9, the behavior of the QuickGrid changed: When using a paginator, empty rows are now rendered differently than before.

Configure ASP.NET Core Identity with `RequireConfirmedEmail = true`:\n`builder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => { options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedEmail = true; })`\n2.

validation error","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen submitting a form with child objects that have validation errors, the child object is not created and not validation errors are displayed.\n\nDigging into the edit context I see there's an error `'BindingModel' does must start with 'BindingModel.SubModels[0]'`, which looks like it has the keys around the wrong way, and also is worded badly \"does must start with\" should be \"must start with\".\n\nThis is related to https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/56542, but that issue is specifically about nulls causing binding errors, not the knock-on issues I've mentioned here.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe nested object should be created and the validation errors should be displayed correctly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nMinimal repo is here: https://github.com/neoGeneva/BlazorBindingIssue2\n\nIf you submit the form without setting any values you'll get the error messages \"The value '' is not valid for 'SubModelNumber'., 'BindingModel' does must start with 'BindingModel.SubModels[0]'\" which I dig out of the EditContext.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No

attribute","State":"open","Body":"## Problem Statement\nWhen implementing a custom permission checking system in a Blazor Server project, I encountered difficulties creating a universal solution that requires minimal code and allows protecting resource components.\n\n### Desired Flow\n1. While permissions are being checked → show a loader.\n2. After the check:\n   - If access is granted → render the protected body content.\n   - If access is denied → render a fragment with a message about missing rights.\n\nThis is similar to the built-in `[Authorize]` attribute for components and the `AuthorizeView` wrapper for static UI elements.  \nI was able to implement an `AuthorizeView`-like wrapper, but creating an `Authorize`-like attribute proved problematic.\n\n---\n\n## Issues Encountered\n1. **Authorize Attribute Limitations**\n   - Cannot render a custom fragment when access is denied (e.g., message with missing rights).\n   - Cannot easily pass parameters such as a list of required permissions and a custom context model\n```csharp\npublic class SecurityContext \n{\n    public int? ProjectId { get; set; }\n    public int? DepartmentId { get; set; }\n}\n```\nThe problem is that SecurityContext in dynamicly set from url, but attribute can contains only static info. So it is not an option. \n2. **Layout Approach**\n   - Attempted to use multiple layouts to handle authorization states, but Blazor only supports a single layout per page.\n\n3. **Inheritance Approach**\n   - Implemented a base component (`SecurityComponentBaseCore` + `SecurityComponentBase`) that handles loading, access checks, and error messages.\n\n### Example: `SecurityComponentBaseCore.razor`\n```razor\n@if (Loading)\n{\n    <FluentStack HorizontalAlignment=\"HorizontalAlignment.Center\" VerticalAlignment=\"VerticalAlignment.Center\" Style=\"height: 100%\">\n        <FluentProgressRing style=\"width: 62px; height: 62px;\" />\n    </FluentStack>\n}\nelse if (HasAccess)\n{\n    @Body\n}\nelse\n{\n    <FluentMessageBar Intent=\"MessageIntent.Warning\">@ErrorMessage</FluentMessageBar>\n}\n\n@code {\n    public virtual bool Loading { get; set; } = true;\n    public virtual bool HasAccess { get; set; } = false;\n    public virtual string ErrorMessage { get; set; } = string.Empty;\n    private protected virtual RenderFragment Body => builder => { };\n}\n```\n\n### Example: `SecurityComponentBase.cs`\n```csharp\npublic abstract class SecurityComponentBase : SecurityComponentBaseCore\n{\n    [Inject] protected ISecurityManager SecurityManager { get; set; } = default!;\n    [Inject] protected ILogger<SecurityComponentBase> Logger { get; set; } = default!;\n\n    protected virtual SecurityContext Context { get; } = new SecurityContext();\n    protected virtual List<string> RequiredPermissions { get; } = [];\n\n    private protected sealed override RenderFragment Body => BuildRenderTree;\n    protected new virtual void BuildRenderTree(RenderTreeBuilder builder) { }\n\n    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            Loading = true;\n            var res = await SecurityManager.HasAccess(Context, RequiredPermissions);\n\n            HasAccess = res.IsSuccess;\n            Loading = false;\n            if (!HasAccess)\n            {\n                ErrorMessage = res.ErrorMessage ?? \"Access denied\";\n            }\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            Logger.LogError(ex, \"Error checking permissions\");\n            HasAccess = false;\n            ErrorMessage = \"Error checking permissions\";\n        }\n        finally\n        {\n            Loading = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n### Example: `MyComponent.razor`\n```razor\n@inherits SecurityComponentBase\n\n<div>\n    content\n</div>\n\n@code {\n    protected override List<string> RequiredPermissions { get; } = [\"right1\", \"right2\"];\n    protected override SecurityContext Context { get; } = new SecurityContext { ProjectId = 1 };\n\n    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\n    {\n        await base.OnInitializedAsync();\n        // Secure work here\n        await Task.Delay(5000);\n    }\n}\n```\nThe problem in this scenario is that calling `StateHasChanged()` anywhere results in:\n```\nSystem.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'\n```\n\nThis prevents showing the loader only during permission checks (instead it persists until the entire `OnInitializedAsync` of the derived component finishes and a 5‑second delay allows this to be shown). The call to `StateHasChanged()` is necessary in this scenario because it should trigger a re‑render: once the permission check completes, the component should update its UI so that the loader is replaced by either the protected content or the denied fragment. Without this re‑render, the loader remains visible longer than intended.\n\n---\n\n\n# Question\n\nIs there a proper Blazor solution that allows building an `Authorize`-like mechanism with:\n\n- A loader displayed during the permission check  \n- A custom denied fragment that shows missing rights  \n- The ability to pass both a list of required permissions and a context model (`SecurityContext`)  \n\nIs there a recommended pattern or framework support for this scenario?  \nAlternatively, could the existing `Authorize` attribute be extended or modified to handle these requirements?\n\nAttempting to implement something that was not originally intended feels fragile, especially since Blazor evolves quickly and such a workaround may stop functioning in future versions (I have already experienced this).  \n\nTherefore, the core question is: **Is there a proper, supported way to create an equivalent of `Authorize` or a reworked version that will reliably function in Blazor?**\n\nIt is possible that I have not fully understood all aspects of Blazor’s authorization system and may be missing something important. I would be glad to read any comments, clarifications, or suggestions.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65007","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Custom Authorization analog of Authorize attribute\" (#65007)"},{"Id":"3800615869","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-11T02:03:07","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"65006","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"open","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

a referenced class with an abstract member","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI have a form that's `[SupplyParameterFromForm]` to bind a class. That class has a property that references another class which is abstract and has abstract members.\n\nWhen attempting to submit the form the class is not bound, no validation errors are shown, and no exception is thrown. Using the debugger I discovered an error value deep in the EditContext: `No method 'PushPrefix' on type 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Endpoints.FormMapping.FormDataReader' is compatible with the supplied arguments.`\n\nI can use `[IgnoreDataMember]` on the property to work around the issue for myself, though it was quite a pain figuring out what the issue even was.\n\nIdeally when an exception is thrown internally then there should be more visibility to it, either a runtime error or something in the validation messages.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Use HostBuilder or WebApplicationBuilder instead. For more information, visit https://aka.ms/aspnet/deprecate/008.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [x] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nWe recommend the use of `HostBuilder` and `WebApplication` going forward over `WebHostBuilder` because they have all the features of `WebHostBuilder` and will be the focus of future investment.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nSee https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host or https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/webapplication for more details on the different hosting models. As well as [HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder) and [Introducing WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model) for migration guides.\n\nBelow is an example of converting `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder`:\n\n**Before**\n```csharp\nvar hostBuilder = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup()\n    .UseKestrel();\n// Test code might use TestServer:\nvar testServer = new TestServer(hostBuilder);\n```\n\n**After**\n```csharp\nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseTestServer() // If using TestServer\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\nawait host.StartAsync();\n\nvar testServer = host.GetTestServer();\n```\n\nBoth Copilot and ChatGpt have given good results so far when asked to convert a WebHostBuilder example to use HostBuilder.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

Up until now, I've entirely relied on the stock DI libraries for all my IoC needs. To handle multi-tenancy, I wanted to enable scenarios around service lifetime that segregates tenant-scoped services away from singletons, scoped and transient services.\r\n\r\nI know [saaskit](https://github.com/saaskit/saaskit) has gone a long way to provide a generic approach to multienancy, but, they've specifically built there DI story around StructureMap, which I am looking to avoid doing. In a future ideal world, I'd like my approach to multi-tenancy to support any DI container that .NET Core supports and is `IServiceProvider` compatible.\r\n\r\nMy current approach is to introduce a subclass of `ServiceDescriptor`: the `TenantScopedServiceDescriptor`. This descriptor supports a fixed lifetime scope of `Singleton`, so if the mutli-tenancy feature is disabled, any services registered with my `AddTenantScoped(...)` are singleton on the root provider.\r\n\r\nThe way I am planning to handle tenant-scoped services, was to create a new `IServiceProvider` on request, once a `TenantId` is resolved. This tenant-scoped provider is cached for the lifetime of the application, like `ApplicationServices`  is. Once I have the tenant-scoped service provider, the next logical step is to replace `RequestServices` with my own scoped instance from my tenant-scoped parent provider. This is handled through middleware.\r\n\r\nThe way this works under the hood, is when creating the tenant-scoped provider, I enumerate through all the available service registrations, and clone the service collection - except where I encounter a Singleton descriptor (which is not my `TenantScopedServiceDescriptor`). For singleton services, I create a new `ServiceDescriptor` which essentially delegates the instance resolution back to my root provider. The net effect should mean that transient and scoped services still behave as intended, but tenant-scoped services are resolved from my tenant-specific provider, and singletons from `ApplicationServices`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIServiceCollection tenantServices = new ServiceCollection();\r\nforeach (var descriptor in services)\r\n{\r\n    if (descriptor.Lifetime != ServiceLifetime.Singleton)\r\n    {\r\n        // MA - Scoped and transient service descriptors can be added directly.\r\n        tenantServices.Add(descriptor);\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        if (descriptor is TenantScopedServiceDescriptor tssd)\r\n        {\r\n            // MA - Tenant scoped services become singletons in tenant-specific service provider.\r\n            tenantServices.Add(descriptor);\r\n        }\r\n        else if (descriptor.ServiceType != typeof(IServiceCollection))\r\n        {\r\n            // MA - True singletons can be forwarded to the application services for resolution\r\n            tenantServices.Add(new ServiceDescriptor(\r\n                descriptor.ServiceType,\r\n                sp => applicationServices.GetService(descriptor.ServiceType),\r\n                ServiceLifetime.Singleton));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\nWhere this design is falling down, is that I can't create a forwarding `ServiceDesriptor` for open generics, as it requires an explicit open generic implementation type:\r\n\r\n> Open generic service type 'Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptions`1[TOptions]' requires registering an open generic implementation type.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that there was an existing overload for Add* which would support `Func<IServiceProvider, Type, object>` for instance resolution, providing the second argument `Type` as the concrete service type being requested. I can see this has been raised previously in #588, #474 and #498 but each was closed without any real resolution.\r\n\r\nEven if that were possible, it might require some additional changes under the hood to allow open generics to be delegated to an instance factory method - but even that has pitfalls in terms of type assurance etc.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have advice - I'm specifically looking to stick around the stock DI rather than pull in another DI container."},{"Id":"7387277627","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-15T20:50:06","Actor":"TonyValenti","Repository":"aspnet/Home","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2962","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Issue in Microsoft.Net.Http.Headers 2.0.2\" (#2962) at aspnet/Home","RelatedBody":"Hi All,\r\nI'm not sure if this was intended or not, but it looks like the constructor signature of EntityTagHeaderValue changed.

The 1.0-2.0 image is already about 1GB, and would continue to grow with runtime updates. \r\n \r\nFortunately, recent improvements to .NET Core (such as minor version roll-forward) and Docker (multi-stage builds) have reduced the need to use an image with multiple versions of .NET Core. We have seen usage of these multi-version images declining over time, and today, they are a small percentage of our Docker image usage.\r\n\r\nRather than maintaining a single, large image with all possible .NET Core runtimes, we encourage users to use multi-stage builds. Docker's multi-stage feature allows you to compose a single Dockerfile, but still use multiple .NET Core runtimes. Also, starting in 2.1, .NET Core supports rolling forward the runtime version within the major version, which will further reduce the need to have multiple 2.x runtimes side-by-side.\r\n \r\nFor discussion, use https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/349"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"974312682647162880","CreatedAt":"2018-03-15T15:53:40+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Watch @csharpfritz and @shanselman in this recorded video from today's LiveStream about converting an application t… https://t.co/6QP4SCXJ3S","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":15,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"974274384792866817","CreatedAt":"2018-03-15T13:21:29+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Tune in to @csharpfritz and @shanselman talking through an #ASP.NET upgrade at 10am ET / 7am PT / 14:00 UTC! https://t.co/vJe8zHT12j","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":4,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"973691520728510464","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T22:45:23+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now... join us for the weekly #ASPNET Community Standup at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":12,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"973553523186159621","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T13:37:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Today, Jeff shows you how to use dependency injection with web forms... check it out! https://t.co/viqZ28DBrV","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":24,"FavoriteCount":9,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"973350716046626816","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T00:11:09+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join us for the weekly #ASPNET Community Standup this Tuesday at 3:45 PM Pacific / 23:45 GMT at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":5,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"972484011556818945","CreatedAt":"2018-03-10T14:47:10+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Be sure to check out Jeff's live coding stream this morning to see more about our #ASP.NET Core 2.1 preview release. https://t.co/EtKk0fMOgU","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":24,"FavoriteCount":10,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"971084152693866496","CreatedAt":"2018-03-06T18:04:38+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"We are live at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2 !

For one user it's not perceptible , but I can't imagine what it can be with 100 users on a server. The server would just die before user can finish their work\r\n\r\nSo I decided to find now the reason why memory was climbing so much and I isolated one code part that **seems** responsible of part of this memory issue\r\nThen to share with the community, I made one console app and 3 Blazor projects with similar code but targeting different .net version.\r\n  \r\nThe Blazor samples are doing exactly same operation.. 1 million of simple math matrix mulplications then a call to `GC.Collect();`\r\nThe Console app is just to have simpliest code ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nDepending on .NetCore version, memory can raise up to 203 Mb and it never goes back to its initial state although the objects are not referenced anywhere else. Why memory is not released down to its initial value. Is it a memory strategy to allocate enough memory for near future supposed use ?\r\nOn console app it raise from 8Mb to 19Mb so it climbs 11Mb. Why is there a so big difference in size allocation ?\r\n\r\nI know after all my readings about this memory subject that memory in general and GC in particular is a whole Universe...but this issue is so big that I'm wondering on stopping this project now before crashing myself on the memory-wall \r\n\r\nIt's easy to call GC.Collect() after 1 million of operation\r\nHow can I achieve a clean-up startegy when mouse is moving on client browser ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\ngithub repos are there :\r\n\r\n- [console app](https://github.com/pcarret/MemoryTest)\r\n- [blazor template with .NetCore 3.1](https://github.com/pcarret/MemoryIssue31)\r\n- [blazor template with .Net 5.0](https://github.com/pcarret/MemoryIssue50)\r\n- [blazor template with .Net 6.0](https://github.com/pcarret/MemoryIssue60)\r\n\r\n![pca](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7167627/147130234-f83d0b6f-f68a-4896-9589-b4a533ff667a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nI am using VS2022 Version 17.0.2 under Windows 10 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39156","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Very high memory consumption in Blazor app \" (#39156)"},{"Id":"1085611729","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-22T16:56:58","Actor":"DaveLaa","Number":"39132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Advanced NewtonsoftJson parsing error handling","State":"closed","Body":"Advanced Newtonsoft parsing error handling\r\n\r\nI have a suggestion to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson project to improve the possibility of parsing error handling. \r\n\r\nIn my services project I have the need to be able to decide which parsing error of json objects sent to my service are tollerable and can be safely ignored. I achieve this goal by adding an error handler in the SerializerSettings of NewtonsoftJson and setting the Handled property to true.\r\nThis was no problem as long as my service project was compiled against .Net Framework. But now we refactored the services to compile against .Net Core 5 and here I found out that there is no way to have this decision.\r\n\r\nIn my new Startup I added the NewtonsoftJson support and also my error handler like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Startup {\r\n\t\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n\tpublic void ConfigureServices( IServiceCollection services ) {\r\n\t\r\n\t\t...\r\n\r\n\t\tservices.AddControllers().AddNewtonsoftJson( opts => {\r\n\t\t\t\t...\r\n\t\t\t\topts.SerializerSettings.Error = ( sender, args ) => {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif(...){\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t...\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\targs.ErrorContext.Handled = true;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t} );\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut whatever i declare handeld, the error was allways thrown anyways by the AspNet framework. I debugged the NewtonsoftJsonInputFormatter and found out that here all errors are passed to the ModelStateDictionary regardless of being handled before or not. More important is that the parsed model ist not returned (always `return InputFormatterResult.Failure();`) and my service entdpoint gets a null object instead. There is also no way to configure a different behaviour.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion ist now to look into the Handled property and ignore errors that are already handled by user in external code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class NewtonsoftJsonInputFormatter : TextInputFormatter, IInputFormatterExceptionPolicy\r\n{\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n\tpublic override async Task<InputFormatterResult> ReadRequestBodyAsync(\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tvoid ErrorHandler(object sender, Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.ErrorEventArgs eventArgs)\r\n\t\t{\r\n>>\t\t\tif( eventArgs.ErrorContext.Handled ){\r\n>>\t\t\t\t// Error was already handeld by User in external code\r\n>>\t\t\t\treturn;\r\n>>\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tsuccessful = false;\r\n\t\t\t....\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t...\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to implement this feature in future versions of .Net Core

In the simple demo, wrapping the string in a model does seem to resolve the issue. However, in my production issue, I have a radio button that cannot be bound directly to the model. It needs to be translated first. It exhibits the same behavior, where clicking on an option the first time does not select it if I have first made an edit to an input field. The second click works.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen I edit a text file and then click (using the mouse) on the next field or on a button, that click should be registered.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nHere are the repo steps:\r\n1.\tGo to [https://blazorformsample.azurewebsites.net/](https://blazorformsample.azurewebsites.net/)\r\n2.\tClick the submit button.

Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?   I am following the code here even though we have normal MVC and not razor pages like you have in the example.  I am still just calling \r\n\r\n>var signInUserResult = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(userName, password, rememberMe, true);\r\n\r\nNote: I am using Asp .net Identity in Identity server 4 application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/2079","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remember me isPersistent understanding\" (#2079)"},{"Id":"383297898","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-21T22:08:40","Actor":"mmillican","Number":"2080","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace a Role Validator","State":"closed","Body":"I am trying to create a custom role validator to support pseudo-multi-tenancy (which I know is not _officially_ supported in Identity) and am running into some issues.\r\n\r\nI've verified that my validator does work and is being called.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`.

The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object.

There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

Eg.:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-0f87920dc675fdfdf8d7638d3be66577-bd6bdbf32d21b714-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"\": [\r\n+      \"A non-empty request body is required.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"value\": [\r\n      \"The value field is required.\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is an alignment with other parts of the framework that were already using the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody) and also a fix to a reported issue dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29570\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nNo change is required, however, if you getting an unexpected behavior is recommended to review if your client's requests are sending the appropriated headers/information.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC Action Controllers","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/484","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding\" (#484)"},{"Id":"1154726545","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-01T01:08:45","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"483","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Event IDs for some Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core log messages changed","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs part of updating the Microsoft.AspNetcore.Mvc.Core assembly to use `LoggerMessageAttribute`, we discovered logger event Ids being reused within a single log category.

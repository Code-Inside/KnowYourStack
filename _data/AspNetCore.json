Have an explicit height to cause the scroll range to be correct and represent the whole virtualized UI\r\n2. Detect when scrolling is bringing them close to the visible viewport so we know to change the set of rendered elements\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it's currently hardcoded to use `div` elements for these spacers. While pretty general-purpose, there are some cases where `div` is not technically allowed, such as directly inside a `tbody`.\r\n\r\nIn the past we decided it works well enough anyway, since the browser doesn't really care if you put a `div` inside a `tbody` via JavaScript. However this *does* cause a problem if you do it in the initial HTML page, such as when prerendering. The browser's HTML parser will think *hey that's not right, let me fix that for you* and gives you a DOM structure like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div style=\"height: 0px\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"height: 12345px\"></div>\r\n<table>\r\n   <tbody>\r\n        ... user-rendered element 1 ...\r\n        ... user-rendered element 2 ...\r\n        ...\r\n        ... user-rendered element N ...\r\n   </tbody>\r\n<table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n... i.e., it moves the spacers outside the table. This doesn't cause much of a problem because as soon as Blazor starts up interactively, it rebuilds the DOM anyway and puts things in the right places. But during the time between prerendering and interactivity, you may see a flash of malformed content.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\npublic class Virtualize<TItem>\r\n{\r\n+    /// <summary>\r\n+    /// Gets or sets the tag name of the HTML element that will be used as the virtualization spacer.\r\n+    /// One such element will be rendered before the visible items, and one more after them, using\r\n+    /// an explicit \"height\" style to control the scroll range.\r\n+    ///\r\n+    /// The default value is \"div\". If you are placing the <see cref=\"Virtualize{TItem}\"/> instance inside\r\n+    /// an element that requires a specific child tag name, consider setting that here. For example when\r\n+    /// rendering inside a \"tbody\", consider setting <see cref=\"SpacerElement\"/> to the value \"tr\".\r\n+    /// </summary>\r\n+    [Parameter]\r\n+    public string SpacerElement { get; set; } = \"div\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<Virtualize SpacerElement=\"tr\">...</Virtualize>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\n~~We could avoid having this be configurable, and instead JS logic that looks at the actual parent element at runtime and decides whether to use a `div`, a `tr`, or whatever. That's nice but the main problem is it would be a breaking change. I know some people already are using CSS to target the spacer element to do particular things with it like set a background color in case it becomes visible during fast scrolling.~~\r\n\r\nUpdate: No, that alternative is total nonsense, even ignoring the breaking change aspect. I just realised it wouldn't work in prerendering (as there's no JS running) and the whole point of this fix is to work with prerendering. It has to be done in .NET code. I'm not aware of a sensible alternative design.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nNothing significant. If people do something nonsensical such as entering an illegal tag name value (e.g., an empty string), the browser will already give them a sensible message at runtime when Blazor tries to use it when constructing an element.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42449","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow configuring virtualization spacer element type\" (#42449)"},{"Id":"1285814145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-27T16:26:38","Actor":"jenspettersson","Number":"42444","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Stop connection immediately after Send won't always deliver the Send","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nNot sure this is a recommended way of doing this, but we have a .net service that executes very infrequently and on some occasion it needs to connect to a SignalR hub and invoke a method. Due to the infrequent use, we are starting a new connection, invoking the method and then closing the connection immediately, illustrated by a simplified sample that can reproduce our problem:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n    .WithUrl(\"http://localhost:5067/hub\")\r\n    .Build();\r\n\r\nawait hubConnection.StartAsync();\r\n\r\nvar message = Guid.NewGuid().ToString().Substring(0, 8);\r\n\r\nawait hubConnection.SendAsync(\"TestMethod\", message);\r\n\r\nawait hubConnection.StopAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, most of the time, but not every time. Sometimes the hub doesn't receive the invokation request at all, only the connection/disconnection, illustrated by this screenshot from the sample repo I'll include:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125493/175948695-e25d2ef4-ea07-49ec-8109-fcf6afe042be.png)\r\n\r\nIt's very random, and thus hard to reproduce. \r\n\r\nThis happens in our production code where the invocations are a lot less frequent than in the reproduce repository. And as I said, it's really random.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, by adding a:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nawait Task.Delay(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nbetween the `SendAsync` and `StopAsync` it doesn't miss anything (at least that's what I think based on my not-very-scientific-way-of-reproducing this).\r\n\r\nWe can of course try to register our signalr client as a singleton with a shared connection that always are alive, but I've always belived that when the `SendAsync` task was done, the message was sent to the server, but now it seems like it's not fully sent and the `StopAsync` might prevent the message from arriving.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen the `SendAsync` task is done, the message has been delivered to the server and we can safely call `StopAsync` on the connection.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nA super simple solution with two projects that sometimes reproduces this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jenspettersson/signalr-debug\r\n\r\n# To reproduce\r\n\r\nUsing a terminal/command line:\r\n\r\n1.

This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\r\nFirst, please describe the purpose and value of the new API here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn preview4, we introduced support for an OpenAPI package that included extension methods on the then `RouteHandlerBuilder` (now `IEndpointBuilder`) for constructing an `OpenApiOperation` from an endpoint. These extension methods were placed in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` namespace.\r\n\r\nFor consistency with the rest of the ecosystem, we want to move these extension methods to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder namespace.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- namespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi;\r\n+ namespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;\r\n\r\npublic static class OpenApiRouteHandlerBuilderExtensions\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n**Before Change**\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi;\r\n\r\nvar app = WebApplication.Create();\r\napp.UseRequestDecompression();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", ...).WithOpenApi();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**With Change**\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;\r\n// No additional namespace references needed\r\n\r\nvar app = WebApplication.Create();\r\napp.UseRequestDecompression();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", ...).WithOpenApi();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nNone, API waas introduced in .NET 7 so no risk of breaking change and delta allows us to confirm with the standard for builder extension methods elsewhere.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42445","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Move OpenAPI extension methods to M.A.Builder namespace\" (#42445)"},{"Id":"1285804724","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-27T13:23:48","Actor":"Alerinos","Number":"42443","RawContent":null,"Title":"NavigationManager change URL without redirection","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

Get/Return calls must form a stack.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe \"wrong pooled instance\" issue is ultimately due to a bug in the code relating to the `@key` -- on the second click it is adding duplicate copies of the same node (and thus duplicate `@key` values).  But the error message is not helpful in discovering this error.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if the duplication occurs at the top level (or in a flat list rather than a recursive tree) then it does report an error about duplicate key values as expected; it's something specific to the use of a tree (or perhaps `RenderFragment`s) that causes this other error, despite this duplication only actually occurring at a single level of the tree.\r\n\r\nAlso interestingly, with the `@key` present it will only render the children once (as expected if the duplication didn't exist, which further conceals the mistake).  Removing the `@key` from the markup reveals the duplicate child nodes, which is what led to discovery of the actual user bug.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAn additional oddity in this example is that the Razor compiler appears to be unable to infer the `TNode` type, despite that it ought to be able to (given how it can infer generic types for form components, etc).  Removing the `TNode=\"Node\"` parameter results in generating code that does not compile:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTreeTest\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor.SourceGenerators\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor.SourceGenerators.RazorSourceGenerator\\Pages_Index_razor.g.cs(265,29,265,34): error CS0449: The 'class', 'struct', 'unmanaged', 'notnull', and 'default' constraints cannot be combined or duplicated, and must be specified first in the constraints list.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(As a side note, when there is a compiler error like this, the source generator output is not visible under Analyzers in VS as usual, which makes it annoying to find the actual problem.  But I used a different method and found that it was generating the constraint as `where TNode : , class`, which is obviously incorrect and different from the component's `@typeparam`.  When the type is specified explicitly it doesn't generate this \"TypeInference\" block at all.)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42433","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better error for \"Attempting to return wrong pooled instance\"\" (#42433)"},{"Id":"1285032477","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-26T21:11:17","Actor":"Mike-E-angelo","Number":"42431","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow Manual/Explicit Route Entries for Blazor `Router` Component","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change.

Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

View types are augmented with the `internal sealed` modifiers by default and included under the `AspNetCoreGeneratedDocument` namespace.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change improves build performance for applications that use Razor views by removing the two-step compilation process and also allows Razor views to participate in the hot reload experience for VS.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n \r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/459","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Razor compiler no longer produces a Views assembly\" (#459)"},{"Id":"850544376","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-05T17:57:32","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"458","RawContent":null,"Title":"Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation","State":"open","Body":"## Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation\r\n\r\nThe extension method `EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.AddDataAnnotationsValidation` is being marked as obsolete. Developers should use the new extension method `EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.EnableDataAnnotationsValidation` instead.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between these two APIs is in their return values:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nEditContext AddDataAnnotationsValidation(this EditContext editContext) { ... }\r\n\r\nIDisposable EnableDataAnnotationsValidation(this EditContext editContext) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe older API returns its `EditContext` (as a kind of fluent API).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new API returns an `IDisposable` whose disposal can be used to remove the data annotations validation support from the `EditContext`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThere are cases where it's desirable to remove the data annotations validation support after adding it. This was not possible with the older API because there was no place to store the internal event subscriptions. The new API returns an object that holds the state necessary to remove data annotations validation support on disposal.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\n**This does not affect most applications, because most applications do not call this directly anyway.** Most applications instead use the `<DataAnnotationsValidator>` component, and do not need to be changed. The use of the extension methods discussed here is a rare and advanced case.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you do call `editContext.AddDataAnnotationsValidation()`, then replace that call with `editContext.EnableDataAnnotationsValidation()`. Optionally, captured the new returned `IDisposable` and dispose it if you later wish to undo the effects of the call.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.AddDataAnnotationsValidation(EditContext)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.forms.editcontextdataannotationsextensions.adddataannotationsvalidation?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/458","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation\" (#458)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1541527969729892352","CreatedAt":"2022-06-27T21:04:42+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"On this week's #ASPNET Community Standup:\n🚀 Incremental #AspNetCore Migration\n⭐ Featuring Taylor Southwick (… https://t.co/udzdVPKO0D","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":8,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1539292221786140672","CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T17:00:38+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Community Standup - Implementing Authentication and Security in https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Core https://t.co/PBBSgxOwes","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":19,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1539291950691471366","CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T16:59:34+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

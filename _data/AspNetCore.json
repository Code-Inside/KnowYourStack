Fail intermittently in load balanced scenarios","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe asp.net core data protection API's appear to fail intermittently in some load balanced scenarios.\r\nSpecifically key generation does not involve locking so keys generated on different instances are not always shared correctly.\r\n\r\nWe're using the asp.net core data protection APIs in a load-balanced environment (Azure App Service with scaled-out instances running asp.net core 7 app).\r\n\r\nOccasionally we're hitting an issue with multiple instances starting simultaneously and doing the following:\r\n\r\n1) Read the existing Keys\r\n2) There may be none or the existing keys may have expired.\r\n3) Each instance creates a new key and adds it to the store - and then reads the store again.\r\n4) The keys added by the latter instances are not available on earlier ones.\r\n\r\nAs we're using these for auth cookies, this means that authenticated users hitting some instances are not validated and therefore have to log back into the application.\r\n\r\nI believe the following shows an example of what can happen:\r\n\r\n| Instance A| Instance B|\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| Read Keys |  |\r\n|    | Read Keys|\r\n|  Create Key A  |  |\r\n|  Read Keys  |   |\r\n|  |  Create Key B|\r\n|    |  Read Keys |\r\n| Keys A  loaded | Keys A & B loaded |\r\n\r\nIn our scenario, this means a user authenticated on Instance B may get issued a cookie using Key B and their subsequent requests to Instance A (via a load balancer) fail authentication (but requests to B work).\r\n\r\nWe're trying to mitigate this by implementing a cross instance lock (in our case we use a DistrubutedLock, backed by SQL Server).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we don't appear to have a good place to lock the process of reading **and** writing the new key, as they're separate methods we can implement/override (we can wrap the call to read the keys in a lock but that doesn't help).\r\n\r\nWhat we'd like to be able to do is apply a lock around the process which both reads the keys and generates a new one if required, so that the next instance will always get the key generated by the first one to start and will therefore not generate another one.\r\n\r\n| Instance A| Instance B|\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| Aquire Lock |  |\r\n| Read Keys |  Attempt to Aquire Lock |\r\n|  Create Key A  | Wait for lock|\r\n|  Read Keys  |  Wait for lock|\r\n|    |  Read Keys |\r\n| Key A  loaded | Keys A loaded |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI believe this could be solved if the IKeyManager (and the default XmlKeyManager) provided a means to wrap/lock the process of reading the keys and determining if they're valid as well as generating a new one.\r\n\r\nE.G. IKeyManager.ProcessingKeys (which calls GetAllKeys and, when required, also calls CreateNewKey)\r\n\r\nWe could then override this and place a lock around the process.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n7.0.400\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50440","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IKeyManager / XmlKeyManager - Fail intermittently in load balanced scenarios\" (#50440)"},{"Id":"1872651703","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-30T19:58:21","Actor":"Issung","Number":"50416","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix typo in method name StopTrasnsportTracking -> StopTransportTracking","State":"closed","Body":"## Fix StopTrasnsportTracking method name typo\r\n\r\nSimple change, didn't think making an issue would be necessary.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/50416","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix typo in method name StopTrasnsportTracking -> StopTransportTracking\" (#50416)"},{"Id":"1874232093","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-30T19:56:33","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"50438","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/source-build-externals","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:3dc3d394-290e-43ab-8e2f-08db9e435944)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-externals\r\n- **Subscription**: 3dc3d394-290e-43ab-8e2f-08db9e435944\r\n- **Build**: 20230830.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 30, 2023 6:44:46 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: c88d8d75ed6b8d426b7fad50eadd7f6fec46a7e4\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.source-build-externals**: [from 8.0.0-alpha.1.23429.1 to 8.0.0-alpha.1.23430.3][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-externals/compare/0603839a51...c88d8d75ed\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:3dc3d394-290e-43ab-8e2f-08db9e435944)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/50438","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/8.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/source-build-externals\" (#50438)"},{"Id":"1874280866","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-30T19:55:07","Actor":"macias","Number":"50439","RawContent":null,"Title":"Please improve error message on deserialization problem","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

The `data-permanent` HTML attribute\r\n    * Elements that contain this attribute will have their content preserved between enhanced page updates. The `id` attribute on an element marked as `data-permanent` will be used to match up data permanent elements when performing DOM synchronization.\r\n    * Note that the data permanent element itself is still subject to removal via SSR update if the updated region includes the existing `data-permanent` element. Therefore, the `data-permanent` element itself should **not** be added dynamically via JS, (but its _content_ can be, which is the primary use case).\r\n2. `Blazor.registerEnhancedPageUpdateCallback(callback)`\r\n    * This API can be used in cases where the `data-permanent` attribute is not sufficient. It lets you get notified when an enhanced page update occurs so changes to the DOM can be made in response.\r\n    * Callbacks will be invoked any time the document changes due to an enhanced update, including streaming rendering updates and enhanced form posts. It does not _only_ get involved when a navigation occurs.\r\n    * Callbacks do not get invoked automatically upon registration or after the initial page load.\r\n\r\nFixes

brand new Blazor Web App project and modified Index.razor this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@page \"/\"\r\n@using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;\r\n\r\n<PageTitle>Index</PageTitle>\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello,

Blazor Web project template","State":"open","Body":"We should make sure that the new Blazor Web project template enables a scenario similar to what Blazor Server template would offer out of the box. To achieve this, we should add a new option for the Blazor Web App template that will make the root level component interactive out of the box.\r\nThe list below represents all the options we will have for the Blazor Web App project template:\r\n- Server interactivity: on / off\r\n- WebAssembly interactivity: on / off\r\n- **Interactive root: on / off**\r\n- Empty: on / off\r\n\r\nWith all these options, enabling interactivity like the **Blazor Server** template would support would mean enabling the following set of options:\r\n\r\n- Server interactivity: **on**\r\n- Web Assembly

ModelStateInvalidFilter","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI'm trying to add an action filter that logs validation errors (because `ModelStateInvalidFilter` only logs the fact that there was a validation error, but not the error details).\r\n\r\nI added my filter globally in `MvcOptions.Filters`, but my filter is never called. I assumed this was because it was short-circuited by `ModelStateInvalidFilter`, which has an `Order` of `-2000`. So I implemented `IOrderedFilter` in my filter, with an `Order` of -3000, so that it would run before `ModelStateInvalidFilter`. However, my filter is still not called; in fact, even the `Order` property is never called either.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a bug to me. Why can't I add a filter that runs before `ModelStateInvalidFilter`?\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAn action filter with an `IOrderedFilter.Order` lower than `ModelStateInvalidFilter` should run before it.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate the following filter:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class ModelStateErrorFilter : IActionFilter, IOrderedFilter\r\n{\r\n    private readonly ILogger<ModelStateErrorFilter> _logger;\r\n\r\n    public ModelStateErrorFilter(ILogger<ModelStateErrorFilter> logger)\r\n    {\r\n        _logger = logger;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)\r\n    {\r\n        if (context.ModelState.IsValid)\r\n            return;\r\n\r\n        var errors = context.ModelState.ToDictionary(\r\n            kvp => kvp.Key,\r\n            kvp => string.Join(\";\", kvp.Value?.Errors.Select(e => e.ErrorMessage) ?? Enumerable.Empty<string>()));\r\n        _logger.LogInformation(\"The ModelState for this request has errors: {Errors}\", errors);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // To execute before ModelStateInvalidFilter, otherwise it would be short-circuited\r\n    public int Order => -3000;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd it as a global filter:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddControllers(options =>\r\n    {\r\n        options.Filters.Add<ModelStateErrorFilter>();\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the app, and send a request with model state errors\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n7.0.400\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nA possible workaround is to disable `ModelStateInvalidFilter` with this:\r\n```csharp\r\n.ConfigureApiBehaviorOptions(options => options.SuppressModelStateInvalidFilter = true)\r\n```\r\nand call `ApiBehaviorOptions.InvalidModelStateResponseFactory` myself to set the result.\r\n\r\nIt's not ideal. I'd rather not reimplement `ModelStateInvalidFilter` myself, and it shouldn't be necessary anyway.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50432","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Cannot run an action filter before ModelStateInvalidFilter\" (#50432)"},{"Id":"1873969031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-30T16:00:49","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"50431","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Form mapping support for select multiple, logging, DataMember and other improvements/cleanups","State":"open","Body":"* Support binding multiple values for a given form key for primitive collections (select multiple is the use case).\r\n* Add logging and more tests to our metadata factory\r\n* Add support for `DataMember` in the expression formatter.\r\n* Add an expression cache for simple member access expressions in `FieldIdentifier`","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/50431","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[Blazor] Form mapping support for select multiple, logging, DataMember and other improvements/cleanups\" (#50431)"},{"Id":"1872673959","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-30T15:58:06","Actor":"comc","Number":"50418","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Hub with Azure API Management","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n### Context:\r\nA backend API with an integrated SignalR hub for server events sent from controller actions deployed as an app service to API Management.\r\n\r\n### Problem:\r\nNegotiating through the API Management gateway URI returns `400 Bad Request` with error `Invalid websocket upgrade request`.\r\n\r\n`curl -X POST \"https://<APIM_Gateway>.azure-api.net/SignalR/negotiate\"`\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n```\r\n*   Trying <ip_redacted>:443...\r\n* Connected to <APIM_Gateway>.azure-api.net (<ip_redacted>) port 443 (#0)\r\n* ALPN: offers h2,http/1.1\r\n* (304) (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\r\n*  CAfile: /etc/ssl/cert.pem\r\n*  CApath: none\r\n* (304) (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):\r\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):\r\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Server key exchange (12):\r\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Server finished (14):\r\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client key exchange (16):\r\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):\r\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\r\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):\r\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\r\n* SSL connection using TLSv1.2 / ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384\r\n* ALPN: server did not agree on a protocol.

They expose a single controller (a few GET operations and a single POST method). Calls to the POST method are successful I would say about 80-90% of the time. The remaining times I'm getting 502 Bad Gateway responses.\r\n\r\nI did some investigation and below are my findings:\r\n\r\nOn the receiving side of the POST method we have the following:\r\n\r\n* The POST method doesn't report any warnings nor does it report any errors. I even added the following configuration to appsettings.json but no luck:\r\n\r\n```json  \r\n\"Logging\": {\r\n    \"LogLevel\": {\r\n      \"Default\": \"Information\",\r\n      \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\",\r\n      \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Warning\",\r\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpLogging.HttpLoggingMiddleware\": \"Warning\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The handler of the above POST method doesn't do much. In fact, I changed the code to act as a pass-through and the errors are still there. In other words, no communication with external endpoints or any crazy threading that would get in the way.\r\n\r\n* I doubled resources for that web-api, memory and cpu looks fine. There are a few more metrics that I checked but nothing stands out.\r\n\r\n* The web-api is configured as follows (cors to allow everything, no https, no authentication). This is purely for internal purposes, stripped down\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System.IO.Compression;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.ResponseCompression;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpLogging;\r\nusing Prometheus;\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\nconst string defaultCorsPolicyName = \"HeartbeatCors\";\r\nbuilder.Services.AddCors(options =>\r\n{\r\n    options.AddPolicy(defaultCorsPolicyName,\r\n        policy =>\r\n        {\r\n            policy.AllowAnyOrigin()\r\n                .AllowAnyHeader()\r\n                .AllowAnyMethod();\r\n        });\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Add services to the container.\r\nbuilder.Services.AddControllers();\r\n\r\n// Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle\r\nbuilder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();\r\nbuilder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();\r\nbuilder.Services.AddHealthChecks();\r\n\r\nbuilder.Services.Configure<GzipCompressionProviderOptions>(options => options.Level = CompressionLevel.Optimal);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddResponseCompression(\r\n    options =>\r\n    {\r\n        options.MimeTypes = new[]\r\n        {\r\n            \"text/plain\",\r\n            \"application/json\",\r\n            \"text/json\"\r\n        };\r\n    });\r\n\r\nbuilder.WebHost.UseKestrel((context, options) =>\r\n{\r\n    options.Limits.MaxResponseBufferSize = 512 * 1024; // 512KB\r\n    options.Limits.KeepAliveTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15);\r\n});\r\n\r\nbuilder.Services.AddHttpLogging(logging =>\r\n{\r\n    logging.LoggingFields = HttpLoggingFields.All;\r\n    logging.MediaTypeOptions.AddText(\"application/json\");\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.Map(\"/\", () => Results.Redirect(\"/swagger\"));\r\n\r\n// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\r\napp.UseSwagger();\r\napp.UseSwaggerUI();\r\n\r\napp.UseResponseCompression();\r\napp.UseHttpLogging();\r\n\r\napp.UseCors(defaultCorsPolicyName);\r\n\r\napp.MapControllers();\r\napp.UseHttpMetrics();\r\napp.MapHealthChecks(\"/status\");\r\napp.MapMetrics();\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n* In front of the web-api we have an instance of traefik 2.8.0. I enabled debug logging on traefik and that didn't offer much except of: \r\n\r\n> 'time=\"2023-08-30T10:36:00Z\" level=debug msg=\"'502 Bad Gateway' caused by: EOF\"'\r\n\r\n* On the client / caller side, nothing unusual, simple POST requests.

It is not clear at the moment whether this problem is load related. I failed to reproduce this problem locally (i.e. running POST requests from my laptop to that web-api in EKS).\r\n\r\nAny hints / suggestions? I'm running out of ideas.

I don't actually believe there *is* a lack of interest here; I suspect a lot of people just literally aren't *aware* that they aren't getting the analyzers when explicitly referencing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` framework. It took me months to realize that the analyzers were not active in my library project.\r\n\r\nThe official guidance is to use `Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\"` or `Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor\"`, combined with a `<FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" />` item, in order to author libraries for ASP.NET Core. Yet if users do so, they get none of the analyzers that come with `Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"`.\r\n\r\nSome docs issues were opened requesting that this behavior at least be documented (https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/15327, https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/22879), so clearly people *are* hitting this in the real world. It was finally documented as basically \"tough luck\" if you're in that exact situation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/advanced/analyzers?view=aspnetcore-7.0#analyzers-require-microsoftnetsdkweb\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there was some discussion about improving the situation here: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3706\r\n\r\nThat issue was closed, too, and as far as I can tell, that's where the story unceremoniously ends. But the underlying issue was never resolved, despite the fact that it's a situation where the official guidance on making ASP.NET Core libraries leads to a meaningfully worse developer experience.\r\n\r\nSo I'm opening this issue in an attempt to get some eyes on this problem again, because it seems like the ball was dropped on this one.\r\n\r\nJudging by https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3706, it *seems* like there's a clear path forward: The web analyzers should be shipped in a similar fashion to how the BCL source generators (STJ, Regex, etc) are shipped today.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50414","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Analyzers are tied to `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` making them unavailable in ASP.NET Core library projects\" (#50414)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT.

These are some possible options that will keep the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return Accepted(new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status202Accepted, new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic Model Get()\r\n{\r\n   Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n   return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC/API Controller actions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/485","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ActionResult<T> set StatusCode to 200\" (#485)"},{"Id":"1149914360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T20:33:05","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"482","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\n\nStarting in .NET 7, Blazor components use [`ActivatorUtilities`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities) to instantiate components. This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

This property file is then fed to downstream repositories, which import it after their `eng/Versions.props`. The resulting behavior is that the downstream repo overrides all dependency versions specified in `eng/Versions.props` with the versions built from source. This behavior is **not** the same as the Maestro dependency-flow based approach. Maestro only updates properties for dependencies that are specified in `eng/Version.Details.xml`.\r\n\r\nThis causes the following difference: Say that dotnet/aspnetcore has a `Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset` dependency. It codes a property for that dependency's version in `eng/Versions.props` as `MicrosoftNetCompilersToolsetVersion`, with an older version of the package.\r\n- When building via source-build, roslyn builds first, and aspnetcore will pick up the new version of Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset, even though it doesn't want to.\r\n- When building officially, the non-latest version will be used.\r\n\r\nThis difference tends to cause build breaks in source-build. The version bump may be significant and require repo reaction. This is not ideal and not sustainable.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to only override those versions that are specified in `eng/Version.Details.xml`. This would more closely align the source-build and current official builds. The huge downside is that this will cause an explosion of ref packs. And in some cases, we would be building against old versions but actually executing against newer ones. Non-ideal.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the goals are:\r\n- Reduce source-build build breaks\r\n- Avoid a large increase in ref packs.\r\n- Ensure that it is possible to freeze on old versions of a specific component if absolutely necessary\r\n\r\n### Work Required\r\n\r\n**This work is dependent on https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2982**.\r\n\r\nIn this repo, do the following\r\n- [ ] Obtain a report of un-specified dependencies in this repo. This issue will be updated with instructions on how to do so after https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2982 is complete.\r\n- [ ] Specify all dependencies classified as missing in the report in the `eng/Version.Details.xml` file.\r\n- [ ] Upgrade dependencies regularly via Maestro dependency flow mechanisms, or pin dependencies that should stay the same, with justification.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43530","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Specify all source-built dependencies and ensure they are regularly updated\" (#43530)"},{"Id":"1349982962","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T20:23:28","Actor":"krispenner","Number":"43526","RawContent":null,"Title":"CORS policy per request","State":"open","Body":"I am trying to set the allowed origins to be based on the tenant of the request. Since the `CorsPolicy` does not have scoped access to the `HttpContext`, I'm looking at injecting my own custom [CorsPolicyProvider](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Middleware/CORS/src/Infrastructure/DefaultCorsPolicyProvider.cs) which is given the `HttpContext` and can then return a custom built `CorsPolicy` which includes only the tenant's allowed origins.\r\n\r\nHowever, I noticed that the `CorsService` accesses the defined policies directly from the `CorsOptions` and bypasses the `ICorsPolicyProvider`. I feel this may be wrong and that the `CorsService` should have a `ICorsPolicyProvider` injected into it instead of the `CorsOptions` and then the Evaluate methods should become async and retrieve the policy from the provider.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/0eaabe0fe5d714753f58ba84c9880403977a7f82/src/Middleware/CORS/src/Infrastructure/CorsService.cs#L58\r\n\r\n1.

Such a message might indicate an attempt to\r\n       perform request smuggling ([Section 9.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-9.5)) or response splitting\r\n       ([Section 9.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-9.4)) and ought to be handled as an error.  A sender MUST\r\n       remove the received Content-Length field prior to forwarding such\r\n       a message downstream.\r\n\r\nKestrel follows this today by honoring the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` and ignoring the Content-Length header. However, the Content-Length header is still present on the request and apps may still be consuming it.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/94cc679bce4967568fd458433ecda3b3fb0578b6/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1MessageBody.cs#L146-L177\r\n\r\nE.g.

This can lead to application level functional and security issues like over/under buffering.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nProposal: Kestrel should implement the following spec guideline \"A sender MUST remove the received Content-Length field prior to forwarding such a message downstream.\", treating the application as the downstream entity. If there is a Transfer-Encoding header then kestrel should remove any Content-Length header to avoid app level confusion.\r\n\r\nSince Kestrel avoids modifying the request in most cases, giving the app as much of the original data as possible, we want to preserve the Content-Length header value by moving it to `x-Content-Length`. This should avoid people consuming the unvalidated value by accident, but it's still available for compat reasons.\r\n\r\nYARP could remove its mitigation after this change.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Length: 500000\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n5\r\nHello\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nRecommended for .NET 8.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43523","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding conflicts\" (#43523)"},{"Id":"1349985086","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T17:39:10","Actor":"ComptonAlvaro","Number":"43527","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to host an ASP Core .NET 6 application in a windows service?","State":"open","Body":"I have an ASP Core Net 6 that host a gRPC service.\r\n\r\nI would like to create a windows service with this ASP Core application.\r\n\r\nI am Having this manual. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/self-hosted\r\n\r\nIn sumary, it says that I have to install the [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices) and call UseWindowsService() method.\r\n\r\nMy code is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.ResponseCompression;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\r\nusing System.IO.Compression;\r\nusing System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;\r\n\r\nusing GestorOrdenadores.Service.Server.Grpc;\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel((context, options) =>\r\n{\r\n    string miStrCertificado = File.ReadAllText(\"certificados/server.crt\");\r\n    string miStrKey = File.ReadAllText(\"certificados/server.key\");\r\n    X509Certificate2 miCertficadoX509 = X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem(miStrCertificado, miStrKey);\r\n\r\n    X509Certificate2 miCertificado2 = new X509Certificate2(miCertficadoX509.Export(X509ContentType.Pkcs12));\r\n\r\n    miCertficadoX509.Dispose();\r\n\r\n    options.ListenAnyIP(5000);\r\n    options.ListenAnyIP(5001, listenOptions =>\r\n    {\r\n        listenOptions.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http1AndHttp2;\r\n        listenOptions.UseHttps(miCertificado2);\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilder.Services.AddGrpc();\r\n\r\nbuilder.Host.UseWindowsService();\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.MapGrpcService<GestorOrdenadoresService>();\r\n\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Communication with gRPC endpoints must be made through a gRPC client.

It is clear that this is a confusing aspect for customers and that they run into issues when they inadvertently introduce problematic patterns in their apps, like components rendering a large set of elements which can cause the memory to grow significantly.\r\n\r\nWhen a customer finds itself in this situation, they generally open an issue with us that suggest there is a memory leak in the framework (which has not been the case so far) and we get into a discussion where we explain how Blazor deals with circuits, how memory works in Server GC and how to troubleshoot memory issues. The general points that people miss are:\r\n* Circuits are alive for a given time after the session ends (up to a maximum number of circuits) to support reconnection.\r\n* The server will only collect the circuits when it triggers a collection for the generation they live in, and in general, they will tend to go to Gen2.\r\n* Server GC will only trigger a Gen2 collection when the server is running low on memory.\r\n\r\nIt will be extremely helpful if we can add additional diagnostics to help bring visibility into some of the internal aspects of how Blazor server operates. Specifically:\r\n* dotnet-counters to track on a given server instance over time:\r\n  * The number of connected circuits.\r\n  * The number of disconnected circuits.\r\n\r\nThis makes it trivial to prove that we are handling the circuit lifetime correctly (or to spot when we are not) and since all the allocated framework memory is rooted by a circuit, it makes it easy to prove that the memory issue is not on the framework.\r\n\r\nFurther diagnostics to help identify problematic circuit instances using clrMD to identify circuits consuming a large amount of memory. We can do this as follows:\r\n* Attach to the live process (or a memory dump).\r\n* Walk the heap to find all the CircuitHost instances.\r\n* For each CircuitHost instance, introspect its renderer and look at the ComponentState instances.\r\n* For each ComponentState, we look at the backing field for the CurrentRenderTree\r\n* On the RenderTreeBuilder we look at RenderTreeFrameArrayBuilder we look at the _items field to check the length of the array as well as the `_itemsInUse`.\r\n* With this information, we can point out when a component rendered a large number of elements in the past or is currently rendering a large number of elements.\r\n  * If it is currently rendering a large number of elements, `_itemsInUse` will be large.\r\n  * If it has rendered a large number of elements in the past `_items` will be large.\r\n\r\nWith this data, we should be able to point out what components rendered a large number of elements currently or in the past as well as what circuit they belong(ed) to and its current state (whether the circuit is active, disconnected, or waiting to be collected) and it should also help discard the framework or the component rendering as the source of the memory issues.\r\n\r\nNote that this could also be extended to use something similar to `!objsize` on a component instance to track how much memory that component is allocating, which in turn would help identify components in the app that are holding on to a lot of memory (think for example a component that has a large list in memory).\r\n\r\nThis last bit is not only useful for Blazor Server but it might be useful too for Blazor Webassembly and Desktop.\r\n\r\nAnother way to identify issues with the app this issue would be to check the `ArrayPool<RenderTreeFrame>` to identify large buffers that might have been allocated by the app in the past.\r\n\r\nExamples of issues in this area in the past (there are likely more):\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43221\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39238\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39156\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/33547\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/33077\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32588\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30210\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21991\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18556\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/17945\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14545\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/10623\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43513","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Better diagnostics for Blazor server\" (#43513)"},{"Id":"1349334390","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T14:05:48","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"43511","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:32db3699-5666-45da-a1b7-08d8b804cd75)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: 32db3699-5666-45da-a1b7-08d8b804cd75\r\n- **Build**: 20220823.18\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 24, 2022 9:15:12 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 03c21467c97e75103d429a0e67504e402f6da17d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

But at this stage the user account is already locked in the Database by the Identity framework. With the current flow the system is not aware of that and allows one more additional SiginIn attempt to be made on which the Lockout error is being finally returned.  I'm changing that so when the  user exceeds the maximum access failed attempts on TwoFactorSigin a LockOut error to be returned on the same request which will provide a better end user experience. The behaviour is pretty much the same as in CheckPasswordSignInAsync method.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the change is that for example if an user has `MaxFailedAccessAttempts = 3` and the user enter three times an invalid authentication code, after the third attempt a clear `Lockout` Error to be returned by `TwoFactorSignInAsync`. Currently this happens on the 4th attempt. \r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/43512","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add check and return Lockout Error after unsuccessful TwoFactor SignIn attempt\" (#43512)"},{"Id":"1348993769","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T12:43:26","Actor":"MarvinKlein1508","Number":"43509","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Question] Wrapping Blazor Input components in a custom component","State":"closed","Body":"I could not find the forum section any more to ask a question, so I'm doing it with this blank issue.\r\n\r\nI want to remove many duplicated code from my forms within a Blazor server app. For example: every Input consists of a label, a few divs and a validation message.

Value { get; set; }\r\n    [Parameter] public EventCallback<string?> ValueChanged { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my Index.razor I have this small dmeo form:\r\n```\r\n<EditForm Model=\"Input\" OnValidSubmit=\"Submit\">\r\n    <DataAnnotationsValidator />\r\n    <ValidationSummary />\r\n    <MyInput @bind-Value=\"Input.Name\" />\r\n    \r\n    <button type=\"submit\" class=\"d-block mt-3\">Save</button>\r\n</EditForm>\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    public MyModel Input { get; set; } = new();\r\n    private void Submit()\r\n    {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    public class MyModel\r\n    {\r\n        [MinLength(10)]\r\n        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;\r\n        public string Description { get; set; } = string.Empty;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~The binding works fine~~ EDIT: The binding does not work either.. Also the validation works. However, the `<ValidationMessage />` within my custom component does not work. I only get the validation messages through the `ValidationSummary` component. \r\n\r\nIs there any easy way to achive this? This would reduce our code by a few hundreds of lines.\r\n\r\nI'm pinging you @danroth27 because I saw the latest ASP.NET Standup and saw that you did a binding example with a custom component for a basic input html. Perhaps you can help me out with it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43509","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Question] Wrapping Blazor Input components in a custom component\" (#43509)"},{"Id":"1348917905","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T11:39:23","Actor":"jtheisen","Number":"43508","RawContent":null,"Title":"Suggestion for mixing Blazor Webassembly and Server","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nIn Blazor Webassembly components are rendered on the client, in Blazor Server they are rendered on the server.\r\n\r\nIn NextJS, React components can be rendered on the server and but then also re-rendered on the client.\r\n\r\nI'm relatively new to Blazor and wondering why Blazor has such a strict separation between client and server rendering compared to NextJS. Really, I want both.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWhile I can see that rendering a component in an entirely different environment is hair-raisingly complicated and error-prone in the context of Blazor (it's already icky in React), there is some much more simple middle ground: Have some components always render on the server and some always on the client.\r\n\r\nThe components I want rendering on a client are those with lots of UI state and DOM event handlers. The components I want rendered on the server are those visible after initial page navigation. While there is an overlap, I think with some care and perhaps some minor duplication of components in that overlap this approach should work fine.\r\n\r\nStill, the server side must be able to trigger a client-side component update by setting parameters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<MyServerSideComponent>\r\n    <MyClientSideComponent SomeParam=\"@Foo\" />\r\n</MyServerSideComponent>\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be a Blazor Server component that, when updated, doesn't itself re-render `MyClientSideComponent` but merely sends the parameter values to the client and has the client Blazor WebAssembly do the updating.\r\n\r\nThere's less of a need for the other way round.\r\n\r\nThe way I anticipate using this would less or even do away with the need for server-side state in Blazor Server, which is mostly to allow for maintaining state for UI components.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is a suggestion mostly, but if there's something good to say to the following questions I'd be happy about some pointers.\r\n\r\n- Is there an approach that already gives me much of this with the current state of Blazor?\r\n- Is there a discussion around issues like this I haven't found yet?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43508","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Suggestion for mixing Blazor Webassembly and Server\" (#43508)"},{"Id":"1349198187","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T10:13:59","Actor":"albi005","Number":"43510","RawContent":null,"Title":"HubClientProxyGenerator doesn't run when using inferred generic type arguments","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nSignalR client proxy code isn't generated when using the extension method with auto-inferred type arguments (as suggested by Visual Studio).\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe proxy code is generated.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nAdd [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.SourceGenerator`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.SourceGenerator) package reference, add this code to a C# file:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client;\r\n\r\nnamespace ConsoleApp4;\r\n\r\ninternal static class Program\r\n{\r\n    static HubConnection hubConnection = null!;\r\n\r\n    static void Main()\r\n    {\r\n        hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder().WithUrl(\"...\").Build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static void Register(IClient client)\r\n    {\r\n        // \\/ Remove type argument here \\/\r\n        hubConnection.RegisterClient<IClient>(client);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]\r\ninternal class HubServerProxyAttribute : Attribute\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]\r\ninternal class HubClientProxyAttribute : Attribute\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\ninternal static partial class MyCustomExtensions\r\n{\r\n    [HubClientProxy]\r\n    public static partial IDisposable RegisterClient<T>(this HubConnection connection, T provider);\r\n\r\n    [HubServerProxy]\r\n    public static partial T GetServerProxy<T>(this HubConnection connection);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic interface IServerHub\r\n{\r\n    Task SendMessage(string message);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic interface IClient\r\n{\r\n    Task ReceiveMessage(string message);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Client : IClient\r\n{\r\n    public Task ReceiveMessage(string message) => Task.CompletedTask;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen remove the generic type argument at line 18.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43510","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HubClientProxyGenerator doesn't run when using inferred generic type arguments\" (#43510)"},{"Id":"1348848574","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T06:13:16","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"43506","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/7.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:12652ed0-752c-46b0-ddca-08da7ef63a55)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/efcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 12652ed0-752c-46b0-ddca-08da7ef63a55\r\n- **Build**: 20220823.14\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 24, 2022 4:06:08 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 915000c0100415bc7d2d776c04472673cca2a8ab\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/7.0\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

These are some possible options that will keep the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return Accepted(new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status202Accepted, new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic Model Get()\r\n{\r\n   Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n   return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC/API Controller actions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/485","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ActionResult<T> set StatusCode to 200\" (#485)"},{"Id":"1149914360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T20:33:05","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"482","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\n\nStarting in .NET 7, Blazor components use [`ActivatorUtilities`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities) to instantiate components. This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection. In 6.0, when formatting using System.Text.Json, `IAsyncEnumerable<>` instances are no longer buffered by MVC, instead relying on the support for these types added to System.Text.Json.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the absence of buffering would not be observed by the application. However, some scenarios may have inadvertently relied on the buffering semantics to correctly serialize. For instance, returning an `IAsyncEnumerable<>` that is backed by a EF query on a type with lazy loaded properties might result in concurrent query execution which might be unsupported by the provider.\r\n\r\nThis change does not affect output formatting using Newtonsoft.Json, or with XML-based formatters\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0-preview4\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\n`IAsyncEnumerable<>` instances returned from an MVC action as a value to be formatted using `ObjectResult`, or a `JsonResult` would be buffered before being serialized as synchronous collection.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhen formatting using System.Text.Json, `IAsyncEnumerable<>` instances are no longer buffered by MVC.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nSystem.Text.Json added support for streaming `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types. This allows for a smaller memory footprint during serialization.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf your application requires buffering, consider manually buffering the async enumerable: \r\n\r\n```C#\r\n// Before\r\npublic IActionResult Get()\r\n{\r\n    return Ok(dbContext.Blogs);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> Get()\r\n{\r\n    return Ok(await dbContext.Blogs.ToListAsync());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/463","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\" (#463)"},{"Id":"873454283","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-30T23:11:40","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"462","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features split, no longer shipped as a package","State":"open","Body":"## Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features split, no longer shipped as a package\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features is being split into two assemblies, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features and Microsoft.Extensions.Features.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features 5.0 shipped both in the ASP.NET shared framework and as a nuget package.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features 5.0 targeted .NET 4.6.1, .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET 5.0\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features 6.0 will ship only in the ASP.NET shared framework, not as a nuget package.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features 6.0 will target .NET 6.0 only.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.Extensions.Features 6.0 will ship both in the ASP.NET shared framework and as a nuget package.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.Extensions.Features 6.0 will target .NET 4.6.1, .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET 6.0\r\n\r\nThe following types will move to the new assembly.

Create the application described below\r\n2. Go to the endpoint without defining the query parameter (e.g., http://localhost:5001)\r\n3.

Here's how Kestrel now calls it:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic async Task<EndPoint> BindAsync(EndPoint endPoint, ConnectionDelegate connectionDelegate, EndpointConfig? endpointConfig, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n{\r\n    if (_transportFactories.Count == 0)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new InvalidOperationException($\"Cannot bind with {nameof(ConnectionDelegate)} no {nameof(IConnectionListenerFactory)} is registered.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    foreach (var transportFactory in _transportFactories)\r\n    {\r\n        var selector = transportFactory as IConnectionListenerFactorySelector;\r\n        if (CanBindFactory(endPoint, selector))\r\n        {\r\n            var transport = await transportFactory.BindAsync(endPoint, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n            StartAcceptLoop(new GenericConnectionListener(transport), c => connectionDelegate(c), endpointConfig);\r\n            return transport.EndPoint;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    throw new InvalidOperationException($\"No registered {nameof(IConnectionListenerFactory)} supports endpoint {endPoint.GetType().Name}: {endPoint}\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nprivate static bool CanBindFactory(EndPoint endPoint, IConnectionListenerFactorySelector? selector)\r\n{\r\n    // By default, the last registered factory binds to the endpoint.\r\n    // A factory can implement IConnectionListenerFactorySelector to decide whether it can bind to the endpoint.\r\n    return selector?.CanBind(endPoint) ?? true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nWe could implement the interface explicitly instead (e.g. `bool IConnectionListenerFactorySelector.CanBind(Endpoint)`), or not implement it at all since the socket transport is typically going to be the first transport registered and therefore last transport checked by Kestrel.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n~None that I can really think of. SocketTransportFactory is [rarely used directly](https://grep.app/search?current=2&q=SocketTransportFactory&words=true&filter[lang][0]=C%23)~\r\n\r\nEdit: @JamesNK has an interesting risk he brought up in the PR description of #44832.\r\n\r\n> A custom method creating the socket means potentially any endpoint could work. Inside user code, a custom EndPoint implementation could be changed to an endpoint type supported by sockets.

We're making use of `<OpenApiGenerateDocumentsOnBuild/>` and `<OpenApiProjectReference/>`. The implementation of  `GetDocument.Insider` has changed in .NET7 ([https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/43701](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/43701)) to start all  `IHostedService` implementations and allow for all DI configuration to be executed. As pointed out by [bachratyg](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43391#issuecomment-1220878694) this implementation might be handy for some cases, but is also completely undesirable for others. For example, we're using a `IHostedService` implementation to make a call to a microservice in the same solution at startup, which is now impossible to do. We're also validating the presence of certain configuration entries at startup e.g:\r\n` if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(config.GetConnectionString(\"database\"))) { throw new Exception(); }`. This now fails because these are defined in our docker-compose.yml file.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there's a one-size-fits-all solution to this problem but it would at least be nice to have the option to revert back to the previous behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe project builds succesfully and generates an openapi document without invoking a bunch of application code.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nA .csproj:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n\t<PropertyGroup>\r\n\t\t<TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>\r\n\t\t<OpenApiGenerateDocumentsOnBuild>true</OpenApiGenerateDocumentsOnBuild>\r\n\t\t<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\r\n\t</PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n\t<ItemGroup>\r\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Swashbuckle.AspNetCore\" Version=\"6.2.3\" />\r\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server\" Version=\"7.0.0\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />\r\n\t</ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample scenarios:\r\n- Register an `IHostedService` implementation that executes some logic which is impossible to do at build time. For example making a call to a microservice in the same solution.\r\n- Validate the presence of a configuration entry which is defined outside of `appsettings.json` (e.g. user secrets or docker-compose.yml).

But for the last two months, when the server reboots to install updates, one AppPool seemingly chosen at random ends up with its shadow copy being corrupted. Specifically, the `.deps.json` file is filled with nulls, and the main assembly `.dll` is 0kb in size. There are three errors logged in the application event log by the ANCM:\r\n\r\n> 1027: Unable to locate application dependencies.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This might be because the server is not configured to support WebSockets. To troubleshoot this, visit https://aka.ms/blazor-server-websockets-error.`|\r\n|LongPolling|WebSockets|`An unhandled error has occurred.`|\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nImprove overall end-user-experience by enforcing WebSocket use.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure WebSockets are functioning as expected with your application. If you must use Long Polling, the following client and server side changes must be made:\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Server Side\r\n\r\nIn `Startup.cs`, replace `endpoints.MapBlazorHub()` with:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nendpoints.MapBlazorHub(configureOptions: options => \r\n{ \r\n    options.Transports = HttpTransportType.WebSockets | HttpTransportType.LongPolling; \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Client Side\r\n\r\nIn `Pages/_Layout.cshtml`, update the `blazor.server.js` script tag to include the `autostart=\"false\"` attribute:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"_framework/blazor.server.js\" autostart=\"false\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBelow the `blazor.server.js` script tag, add the following snippet. WebSockets (1) and Long Polling (4) are the supported [HTTPTransportType](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.httptransporttype?view=aspnetcore-5.0#fields)s.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n    (function start() {\r\n        Blazor.start({\r\n            configureSignalR: builder => builder.withUrl('_blazor', 1 | 4) // WebSockets and Long Polling\r\n        });\r\n    })()\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following compatibility categories: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Binary compatibility (the newer version can be used without recompiling)\r\n- [ ] Source compatibility (successfully recompiling against newer version requires source changes)\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/470","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disable Long Polling Fallback Transport for Blazor Server\" (#470)"},{"Id":"973152582","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-08-18T00:07:55","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"471","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Razor Pages logging ID change","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nRazor Pages log messages have associated IDs and names.

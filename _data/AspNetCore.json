I cannot really consider it a bug but it's something I would like to point out. If this is by design, that's ok with me as well.\n\nI have put together a fully working demo here: https://github.com/somnatic/openapi-int32-issue-demo. It's basically the \"ASP.NET Core Web API\" project template. Not a single line was changed.\n\nThis project generates an OpenApi definition with the following definition for `temperatureC`  (the full document is also in the Github project):\n\n```json\n          \"temperatureC\": {\n            \"pattern\": \"^-?(?:0|[1-9]\\\\d*)$\",\n            \"type\": [\n              \"integer\",\n              \"string\"\n            ],\n            \"format\": \"int32\"\n          },\n``` \n\nAccording to the OpenApi spec this is essentially correct: \"can be an integer or a string, needs to follow a specific pattern\"\n\nNow, when generating a client with Kiota, Kiota will output the following warning:\n\n```shell\nwarn: Kiota.Builder.KiotaBuilder[0]\n      OpenAPI warning: #/components/schemas/WeatherForecast/properties/temperatureC - The format int32 is not supported by Kiota for the type Integer, String and the string type will be used.\n``` \n\nI can force AddOpenApi using a SchemaTransformer for \"int\" I can make AddOpenApi generate the following definition which Kiota will perfectly accept.\n\n```json\n         \"temperatureC\": {\n            \"pattern\": \"^-?(?:0|[1-9]\\\\d*)$\",\n            \"type\": [\n              \"integer\",\n              \"string\"\n            ],\n            \"format\": \"int32\"\n          },\n``` \n\nNow basically my question or proposal is: Shouldn't this be the default behavior?\n\nI just hope this question isn't too stupid or the solution too obvious.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI'd expect the integer creation as outlined above to be the default\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nProject is here:\nhttps://github.com/somnatic/openapi-int32-issue-demo\n\nYou can un-comment the `TypeTransformer.MapType<int>(new OpenApiSchema {Type = JsonSchemaType.Integer, Format = \"int32\"});` to see what happens if we force the creation of a normal int type.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64501","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generation of OpenApi document conflicts with Kiota's expectations\" (#64501)"},{"Id":"3655641508","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-23T08:14:00","Actor":"khteh","Number":"64500","RawContent":null,"Title":"gRPC integration test `TStartup` = `Program.cs` throws `\"A public method named 'ConfigureIntegrationTests' or 'Configure' could not be found in the 'Program' type.\"`","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44906 is NOT resolved!

Please describe the problem.\n\nProblem description\nIn Blazor Server, the server has no built-in way (that I'm aware of) to know the client time zone or offset for a given circuit.\n\nThe only reliable source for this information is the browser, but the framework does not expose it once the SignalR connection is established.\n\nThis creates friction for any feature that needs to compare or align server timestamps with the user’s local date and time, for example\n• Showing “today” vs “yesterday” in the user’s local zone\n• Validating input that mixes server deadlines with user input dates\n• Logging and diagnostics that need both server and client perspectives\n\nToday, each app has to implement its own JavaScript interop and per-circuit plumbing for something that feels like core infrastructure.\n\nCurrent behavior and workaround\nIn a Blazor Server app that uses prerendering, a JavaScript file downloads and starts the SignalR connection from client to server. At that point, the client knows its time zone and offset, but the server side has no such information.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nMy current workaround looks like this.\n\n1. In MainLayout.razor, use OnAfterRenderAsync with a guard so it runs only once per circuit.\n2. Call JavaScript to read the client zone or offset, for example via\n   • new Date().getTimezoneOffset()\n   • Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone\n3. Send that value back to a scoped service on the server through JS interop.\n4. Store that in a circuit-scoped service, then inject that service everywhere date logic needs to know the client offset.\n\nThis works, but every Blazor Server app that cares about dates needs to repeat the same pattern. It also has ordering concerns. Anything that runs before MainLayout.OnAfterRenderAsync does not see this information.\n\nProposed enhancement\nWhen the SignalR connection for a Blazor Server circuit is established, the framework should automatically capture client time information and expose it through a server side API that is scoped to that circuit.\n\nOne possible shape.\n\n1. Extend RendererInfo with a property such as RendererInfo.UserTimeZoneOffset or similar.\n   • UserTimeZoneOffset would describe the offset between client local time and UTC at the time of connection.\n   • Optionally, another property could expose the IANA time zone identifier if available, for example RendererInfo.UserTimeZoneId.\n\n2. Provide a simple injectable service that exposes the same values for the current circuit, for example\n\n   public sealed class ClientTimeInfo\n   {\n   public TimeSpan UtcOffset { get; init; }\n   public string TimeZoneId { get; init; }\n   }\n\n   This service would be registered with circuit scope in Blazor Server, so any component or service that runs in that circuit has direct access without custom JS interop.\n\n3. During circuit initialization, the framework would\n   • Call a small script on the client that reads time zone information.\n   • Attach this information to the RendererInfo associated with that circuit.\n   • Populate the ClientTimeInfo service instance.\n\nBenefits\n\n1. Consistent handling of local time across apps\n2. Less boilerplate JS interop for a very common requirement.\n3. Better ability to\n   • Show dates and times that match user expectations.\n   • Implement validation based on business deadlines in server time while still respecting client local time.\n   • Record logs that associate a user action with both server UTC and user local time context.\n\nScope and behavior notes\n• This feature would apply to Blazor Server, where circuits and SignalR are present.\n• For prerendering, the value might not be present during the initial static render, but would be available once the circuit activates. A simple null check on the service would handle that.\n• If full time zone id support is considered out of scope, even a simple numeric offset property would still provide value.\n\nSummary\nBlazor Server already tracks useful information about each circuit through RendererInfo. Time zone information is only available on the client, yet date and time logic often belongs on the server. Exposing a circuit-scoped ClientTimeInfo, possibly backed by properties on RendererInfo such as UserTimeZoneOffset, would remove repeated boilerplate and provide a clean, first-class way to align server timestamps with the user’s local date and time.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nI created my own component which injects the scope service, and then displays the Parameter data, and yields a small popup to show the local time.\n\n<img width=\"350\" height=\"136\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb3ac88-8d66-4f72-8894-39f84b9d4671\"

to write validation errors to the response.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nClone [the provided repro](https://github.com/Clockwork-Muse/ProblemDetailsWriter)\n\nStart up the application\n\nMake a web request like `http://localhost:5285/some?id=750`, observe the results do not match the generic \"some response\" configured in the repro, and setting breakpoints in the relevant methods does not result in trapped execution either.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nNone\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.415\n\n### Anything else?\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           8.0.415\n Commit:

OpenAPI 3.0","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen configuring our .NET 10 project to generate OpenAPI documents of version 3.0, the OpenAPI schema for decimal properties seems to be incorrect:\n\n```\n\"temperatureC\": {\n  \"pattern\": \"^-?(?:0|[1-9]\\\\d*)(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?$\",\n  \"format\": \"double\"\n}\n```\n\nWe use version 3.0 as we later on want to import these OpenAPI documents in Azure API Management which doesn't support the newer OpenAPI versions.\n\nHowever, Azure API Management ignores this decimal field because (I think) according to the OpenAPI version 3.0 specification:\n1. The schema is missing the required `type: \"number\"` property\n2. The `pattern` property is only valid for `type: \"string\"`, not numeric types\n\nPreviously with the Swashbuckle library, the property was outputted as\n\n```\n\"temperatureC\": {\n  \"type\": \"number\",\n  \"format\": \"double\"\n}\n```\n\nwhich was imported correctly in Azure API Management.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUse the correct OpenAPI 3.0 specification for decimal properties if the project is configured as such.\n\n```\n\"temperatureC\": {\n  \"type\": \"number\",\n  \"format\": \"double\"\n}\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n[Repro project](https://github.com/thomasvdb/OpenApiDecimalRepo/blob/main/WebApplication1/WebApplication1.json)\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64471","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Decimal properties are not generated correctly in OpenAPI 3.0\" (#64471)"},{"Id":"3651973733","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T14:51:27","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"64472","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Blazor navigation from wasm to interactive server broken","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\n\nError when navigating from \"@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly\" page via Nav menu with href to a page which has @rendermode InteractiveServer Set.\n\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'insertBefore')\n    at q (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:22605)\n    at blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:182422\n    at li (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:182431)\n    at si (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:179662)\n    at ai (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:181600)\n    at si (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:179225)\n    at ai (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:181600)\n    at si (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:179225)\n    at ai (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:181600)\n    at si (blazor.web.j8lzlu28q6.js:1:179225)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt just works with .net8 and .net9.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nCreate a Sample Blazor (Auto) App.\n\n1.

That call hits `CircuitJSComponentInterop.AddRootComponent`, which simply calls `base.AddRootComponent(...)` on the renderer:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/6819df1c75e529d3ccd0a86854577451aa2e26f8/src/Components/Web.JS/src/Rendering/JSRootComponents.ts#L27\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/10ef00003cabb87fb2c00355ad472147679a5f99/src/Components/Server/src/Circuits/CircuitJSComponentInterop.cs#L26\r\n(`getRequiredManager` is not the manager we are interested in, it's only a set of interop methods available for a given component, see https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/6819df1c75e529d3ccd0a86854577451aa2e26f8/src/Components/Web.JS/src/Rendering/WebRendererInteropMethods.ts#L78)\r\n- This bypasses the whole `CircuitHost.PerformRootComponentOperations` pipeline, so `_webRootComponentManager` never gets initialised and no entry is recorded for the new component.\r\n- When the renderer later constructs `RemoteComponentState` for that JS-added root, `RemoteComponentState.GetComponentKey()` invokes `RemoteRenderer.GetMarkerKey(...)`. Because the manager had never been created on this code path, `_webRootComponentManager` was still null and the null-forgiving access `!` resulted in the `NullReferenceException`.\r\n\r\n## Fix:\r\n- Call `Renderer.GetOrCreateWebRootComponentManager()` in `CircuitJSComponentInterop.AddRootComponent`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64467","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Make sure `WebRootComponentManager` is initialized for dynamic JS roots\" (#64467)"},{"Id":"3651283936","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T11:23:55","Actor":"ZTonks","Number":"64466","RawContent":null,"Title":"XML documentation on controllers/endpoints from referenced class libraries is not manifested in OpenAPI document","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nXML documentation is not parsed into OpenAPI documents from endpoints which come from dependent libraries.

application/octet-stream body (415 Unsupported Media Type) even with HttpContext.Body / Accepts<byte[]> — works in .NET 9","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nDescription\n\nAfter upgrading from .NET 9 to .NET 10, Minimal API endpoints that manually read the request body (via HttpContext.Request.Body) no longer accept non-JSON content types such as application/octet-stream.\n\nThe same code works perfectly in .NET 9.\n\nIn .NET 10, the runtime throws:\n`415 Unsupported Media Type\nExpected a supported JSON media type but got \"application/octet-stream\".\n`\nEven when:\n\nthe endpoint does not define any complex parameters\n\nthe endpoint explicitly calls Accepts<byte[]>(\"application/octet-stream\")\n\nthe endpoint manually reads the raw body stream\n\nno model binding is used at all\n\nThis appears to be a breaking change introduced in .NET 10 where RequestDelegateFactory incorrectly forces JSON body binding, even when the endpoint does not request it.\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected Behavior (.NET 9)\n\nThe endpoint accepts application/octet-stream\n\nNo JSON binding is attempted\n\nManual stream deserialization works normally\n\n200 OK\n\nActual Behavior (.NET 10 Preview)\n\nASP.NET Core ignores Accepts<byte[]>\n\nRequestDelegateFactory treats the request as JSON-only\n\nEven though the endpoint never asks for JSON\n\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nReproduction Code:\n`var group = app.MapGroup(\"/statusorcamentopedidos\");\n\ngroup.MapPost(\"CadStatusOrcamentoPedido/{empresaId}/{usuarioId}\",\n    async (Guid empresaId, long usuarioId,\n           HttpContext http,\n

MemoryPackSerializer.DeserializeAsync<StatusOrcamentoPedido>(http.Request.Body);\n    if (status == null)\n        return Results.UnprocessableEntity();\n\n    status.Id = idGen.CreateId();\n    status.EmpresaId = empresaId;\n\n    context.StatusOrcamentosPedidos.Add(status);\n    await context.SaveChangesAsync();\n\n    return Results.Bytes(MemoryPackSerializer.Serialize(status.Id));\n})\n.Accepts<byte[]>(\"application/octet-stream\");\n`\nClient code\n`var bin = MemoryPackSerializer.Serialize(entity);\nvar content = new ByteArrayContent(bin);\ncontent.Headers.ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue(\"application/octet-stream\");\n\nvar response = await client.PostAsync(endpoint, content);\n`Reproduction Code:\n`var

any)\n\nThe request is rejected with:\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.BadHttpRequestException:\nExpected a supported JSON media type but got \"application/octet-stream\".\n`\n\n### .NET Version\n\nnet

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

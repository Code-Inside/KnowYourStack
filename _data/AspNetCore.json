\"{controller}.aspx\" route template","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI have an MVC app with these conrollers among others:\r\n\r\n- LoginController\r\n- VaildateElectronicSignatureController\r\n- ValidateLoginController\r\n\r\nEach of them has an action method with the same signature: `IActionResult ValidateLogin()`.\r\nIt also has the following route mapping:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\napp.MapControllerRoute(\r\n    name: \"default\",\r\n    pattern: \"{controller=Home}.aspx/{action=Index}/{id?}\");\r\n```\r\nNote that the only difference from the default route template is the \".aspx\" suffix after \"{controller=Home}\".\r\n\r\nNow, if I navigate to URI \"/Login.aspx/ValidateLogin\" with this app, I'm getting an `AmbiguousMatchException`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/12996633/ca601ee3-9482-4d25-abf3-67b0b303d99c)\r\n\r\nHere, the ambiguity is between the aforementioned conrollers. This looks like absolute nonsense to me, as the {controller} token should receive the \"Login\" value, and then controller classes with LoginController name should be looked for. However, `VaildateElectronicSignatureController`, for example, has nothing from the captured controller name at all. It looks like matching is done only by action name, so all controllers with that action method do match.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the \".aspx\" suffix from the routing pattern (\"{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}\") and the URI (\"/Login/ValidateLogin\") the error disappears.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a basic app to reproduce the error.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `{controller=Home}.aspx/{action=Index}/{id?}` route template should work similarly to default `{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}` and cause no abiguity with controllers which don't even match the name.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/andriysavin/bugreports/tree/main/RouteTemplateWithAspxBug\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Matching.AmbiguousMatchException: The request matched multiple endpoints.

With #32485 we added `CreateSlimBuilder`, which reduced the set of dependencies, but still brought some default dependencies in - for example #47664 brought in AuthN/Z and #47797 brought back in appSettings.json and logging.\r\n\r\nWe should implement the original proposal in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32485 and make a WebApplicationBuilder that doesn't have any default behavior - i.e. \"empty\".\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder\r\n{\r\n    public class WebApplication\r\n    {\r\n       public static WebApplication Create(string[] args);\r\n       public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateBuilder();\r\n       public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateBuilder(string[] args);\r\n       public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateBuilder(WebApplicationOptions options);\r\n       public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateSlimBuilder();\r\n       public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateSlimBuilder(string[] args);\r\n       public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateSlimBuilder(WebApplicationOptions options);\r\n+      public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateEmptyBuilder(WebApplicationOptions options);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nWebApplicationOptions options = new() { Args = args };\r\nWebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateEmptyBuilder(options);\r\nbuilder.Logging.AddConsole();\r\n\r\nWebApplication app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.UseRouting();\r\napp.UseEndpoints(_ => { });\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello World\");\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nWhen creating an \"empty\" web application, the following features will be on (✅) or off (❌) by default.

Neither post appears to provide the clarity needed, so hopefully what follows will be helpful.\r\n\r\nIn a Blazor app (Net 8 preview), to avoid using `IHttpContextAccessor` we create an authentication cookie in a razor page, then redirect back to Blazor. Within the Blazor app we need to use a Controller method to retrieve an image from an external source and return it in the browser.  This is to provide security and caching.  Also, Blazor pages also need to access the claims.\r\n\r\nTherefore we have created a service that uses `AuthenticationStateProvider`.  The Blazor pages retrieve the claim value just fine, but the controller that uses the same service throws an exception that comes from the underlying `AuthenticationStateProvider`. \r\n\r\nWe are trying to understand why this exception occurs when the service is called from the Controller but does not occur when called from the Blazor page?\r\n\r\nA full repro with step-by-step instructions is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ThinkElevenDave/NetCoreAuthStateErrorRepro\r\n\r\nNote - I am new to Core so I only know what I can find online!  Please be nice 🙄\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe controller should use the injected service to read the cookie claim value, then return an image.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRun the project and follow the steps on-screen.\r\nThe image never loads on the final page.  Debugging the controller try/catch catches the inner exception.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n\"GetAuthenticationStateAsync was called before SetAuthenticationState.\"\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.ServerAuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync()\r\n   at Services.MyService.<GetNameClaimValue>d__2.MoveNext() in BlazorApp1\\Services\\MyService.cs:line 18\r\n   at BlazorApp1.Controllers.ValuesController.<TestAsync>d__2.MoveNext() in BlazorApp1\\BlazorApp1\\Controllers\\ValuesController.cs:line 24\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8\n\n### Anything else?\n\nv8 preview\r\nVS Version 17.7.0 Preview 1.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET SDK:\r\n Version:   8.0.100-preview.3.23178.7\r\n Commit:    e300b0e1e6\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.19045\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.100-preview.3.23178.7\\\r\n\r\n.NET workloads installed:\r\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\r\n\r\nHost:\r\n  Version:      8.0.0-preview.3.23174.8\r\n  Architecture: x64\r\n  Commit:       47bad717bd\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  7.0.302 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  7.0.400-preview.23225.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  8.0.100-preview.3.23178.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.18 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.0-preview.3.23177.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.18 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0-preview.3.23174.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.18 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.0-preview.3.23178.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nOther architectures found:\r\n  arm64 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet]\r\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\arm64\\InstallLocation]\r\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\r\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables:\r\n  Not set\r\n\r\nglobal.json file:\r\n  Not found\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/48806","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"GetAuthenticationStateAsync was called before SetAuthenticationState.\" (#48806)"},{"Id":"1756923226","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-14T13:33:28","Actor":"UseMuse","Number":"48805","RawContent":null,"Title":"VS 2022.

This action causes the transmission of 170kB of data through WebSocket.  \r\n\r\nIf the application uses HttpSys server and is accessed via VPN, transmission takes about 2 seconds. \r\n\r\nIf the application is accessed via VPN but it uses the IIS server or Kestrel Web server, transmission takes about 0.5 second.\r\n\r\nIf the application is running locally, the difference is negligible and not noticeable.\r\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n7.0.7\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/48799","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The Blazor Server application runs significantly slower when using the HttpSys server\" (#48799)"},{"Id":"1756498930","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-14T11:19:06","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"48797","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:8ce5251e-8269-419d-3b2a-08d8b8050dda)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/efcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 8ce5251e-8269-419d-3b2a-08d8b8050dda\r\n- **Build**: 20230614.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: June 14, 2023 9:42:54 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 58e247360f6a20082f72e753909deabd7f9e2581\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **dotnet-ef**: [from 8.0.0-preview.6.23312.10 to 8.0.0-preview.6.23314.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore**: [from 8.0.0-preview.6.23312.10 to 8.0.0-preview.6.23314.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design**: [from 8.0.0-preview.6.23312.10 to 8.0.0-preview.6.23314.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory**: [from 8.0.0-preview.6.23312.10 to 8.0.0-preview.6.23314.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational**: [from 8.0.0-preview.6.23312.10 to 8.0.0-preview.6.23314.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite**: [from 8.0.0-preview.6.23312.10 to 8.0.0-preview.6.23314.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer**: [from 8.0.0-preview.6.23312.10 to 8.0.0-preview.6.23314.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**: [from 8.0.0-preview.6.23312.10 to 8.0.0-preview.6.23314.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/compare/8b986cd33e...58e247360f\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:8ce5251e-8269-419d-3b2a-08d8b8050dda)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/48797","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore\" (#48797)"},{"Id":"1756555125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-14T10:21:56","Actor":"marekott","Number":"48798","RawContent":null,"Title":"Server header value customization","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI have reverse proxy (asp net core app with Yarp) that is deployed in front of my microservices. When examining the response that was send to that proxy I would like to be able to determine if this is the response from mentioned proxy or microservice itself. Previously we have been using Kong which customized server header value so it was clear who responded to request. After switching to new solution both domain microservice and reverse proxy are responding with server header equal to \"Kestrel\".\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to be able to customize server header value so it would be clear without any additional research who responded to incoming request. For example when request will be terminated by proxy due to fact that incoming request url doesn't match any of the yarp routes response header would look like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/46067021/0a90f59c-6206-4db8-aa77-85dc37649731)\r\n \r\nI imagine it something like this:\r\n```\r\n.UseKestrel(o =>\r\n{\r\n    o.AddServerHeader = true;\r\n    o.ServerHeaderValue = \"MyServiceName\";\r\n})\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nFor now I believe I can achieve this with custom middleware but it would be great if this behavior would be achievable without such customization. It is important feature for my team since there are times during providing support for production incidents that we receive only screenshot from developer tools or xhr file and it would speed up determining logs of which component of our application we should examine (microservice and which one or reverse proxy).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/48798","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Server header value customization\" (#48798)"},{"Id":"1756473048","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-14T09:37:42","Actor":"mrpmorris","Number":"48796","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hot reload / dotnet watch not fully working in .NET 8 preview 5","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\ndotnet watch will update the browser when the project itself changes, but not when a dependent project changes (Razor class library).\r\n\r\nVS hot reload doesn't update the browser at all.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUI should update.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

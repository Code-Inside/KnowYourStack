code being run.  It is unclear to me why the exception is thrown.\r\n6. The exception is thrown repeatedly (100 times or more) until IIS Shuts down the site.\r\n6A. I then manually restart the App using IIS.\r\n7. The app then starts and runs successfully for several hours before repeating the above events.\r\n\r\nNote that I have also reproduced this issue by manually recycling the AppPool.  Also, when automatic recycling was turned on, it would sometimes.  But this is not consistent.  Sometimes it does start successfully when the AppPool is recycled.\r\n\r\n8.  This App also runs on a second IIS Server.  Strangely, it has never crashed on this second server.  I am not aware of any configuration differences on the second server.  They both access the same database.\r\n\r\nThis is App.razor:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<CascadingValue Name=\"Authentication\" Value=Authentication>\r\n        <CascadingAuthenticationState>\r\n            <Router AppAssembly=\"@typeof(App).Assembly\">\r\n                <Found Context=\"routeData\">\r\n                    @if (Authentication.IsAuthenticated)\r\n                    {\r\n                    <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=\"@routeData\" DefaultLayout=\"@typeof(MainLayout)\">\r\n                        <NotAuthorized>\r\n                            <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\r\n                                    <strong>Authorization Failure!</strong>@(Authentication.User!=null?Authentication.User.LoginName: \"You\") are not authorized to access this App. Please contact the Help Desk.\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </NotAuthorized>\r\n                    </AuthorizeRouteView>\r\n\r\n                    }\r\n                    else\r\n                    {\r\n                        <LayoutView>\r\n                            <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\r\n                                    <strong>Authentication Failure!</strong>@(Authentication.User!=null?Authentication.User.LoginName: \"You\") are not authorized to access this App. Please contact the Help Desk.\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </LayoutView>\r\n\r\n                    }\r\n                </Found>\r\n                <NotFound>\r\n                    <LayoutView Layout=\"@typeof(MainLayout)\">\r\n                        <p>Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>\r\n                    </LayoutView>\r\n                </NotFound>\r\n            </Router>\r\n        </CascadingAuthenticationState>\r\n    </CascadingValue>\r\n```\r\nThis is App.razor.cs:\r\n```\r\nnamespace CDS\r\n{\r\n    public partial class App\r\n    {        \r\n        [Inject]\r\n        public CdsUserRepository CdsUserRepository { get; set; }   \r\n        \r\n        [Inject]\r\n        AuthenticationStateProvider AuthenticationStateProvider { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Inject]\r\n        private IEventAggregator _eventAggregator { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        private UserPrincipal _authentication;\r\n\r\n        public UserPrincipal Authentication\r\n        {\r\n            get => _authentication ??

using the official image (mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0).\r\n\r\nDuring the day, when the traffic is crazy, the response avg response time for operation X rarely goes above 200ms, with the 99th percentile under 1sec. But during the middle of night (like 4am) there are some HUGE increase in response without any correlation, after all CPU is 100% clear, memory is basically empty, no concurrence, no nothing.\r\n\r\nOperation X does not touch any kind of cache (whether in memory, redis, memchache, etc)\r\n\r\nI've seen this behavior in the past. As it is pretty well documented, IIS used to put apps to sleep. This shouldn't happen here after all, this is hosted on Kestrel/Linux.\r\n\r\nTo check if this is the case here or not I created a simple app the loops a request for operation X every 2 sec and guess what? the response time kept at its peak performance! it performed great, have a look:\r\n<img width=\"1065\" alt=\"d6x7d\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5585339/157242394-80eda61a-9e21-4625-a953-8e7c02f5d70d.png\">\r\nthe blue line is avg response time and red line is response count. Look how on the previous days there's always a spike counter-balancing the request count...\r\n\r\nThis leads me into believing that there is some kind of \"sleeping\" going around...

Our application uses Mvc Core with Newtonsoft Json for serialization/deserialization in requests/responses and is run on HttpSys on Windows. After migration, the net6.0 version is >10 times slower for larger responses (~256KiB).\r\n\r\nPerformance degradation happens for responses larger than 30KiB. The larger the response, the bigger the degradation. \r\n\r\nThis reproduces when the app runs on a remote machine. It does not reproduce when running with HttpSys locally (i.e. request to localhost). It also does not reproduce when app runs on a remote machine on Kestrel or IIS in-process or IIS out-of-process.\r\n\r\nThe issue is somehow related to interaction between `FileBufferingWriterStream` used by `NewtonsoftJsonOutputFormatter` and HttpSys. The version used in netcoreapp3.1 calls `DrainBufferAsync` on `response.Body` which uses `Stream.CopyToAsync(Stream)`. The version used in net6.0 calls `DrainBufferAsync` on `response.BodyWriter` which uses `PipeWriter.CopyFromAsync(Stream)`.  The former reads the buffer file in 128KiB chunks, whereas the latter in 4KiB chunks.\r\n\r\nIf I manually replace `NewtonsoftJsonOutputFormatter` in net6.0 with my own version that differs only in the call to `DrainBufferAsync(response.Body)`, the issue is resolved.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be no performance degradation.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a basic web application:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- WebApplication.csproj -->\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp3.1;net6.0</TargetFrameworks>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0'\" Version=\"6.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netcoreapp3.1'\" Version=\"3.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Program.cs\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\r\n\r\nnamespace WebApplication\r\n{\r\n    public class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>\r\n            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n                .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>\r\n                {\r\n                    webBuilder.UseHttpSys();\r\n                    webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();\r\n                });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Startup\r\n    {\r\n        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)\r\n        {\r\n            Configuration = configuration;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }\r\n\r\n        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n        {\r\n            var options = services.AddControllers();\r\n            options.AddNewtonsoftJson();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n        {\r\n            if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n            {\r\n                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            app.UseRouting();\r\n\r\n            app.UseAuthorization();\r\n\r\n            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>\r\n            {\r\n                endpoints.MapControllers();\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [ApiController]\r\n    [Route(\"[controller]\")]\r\n    public class TestController : ControllerBase\r\n    {\r\n        [HttpGet]\r\n        public IEnumerable<int> Get(int length = 128)\r\n        {\r\n            length *= 1024;\r\n            return Enumerable.Repeat(0, (length - 1) / 2 - 1)\r\n                .Concat(Enumerable.Repeat(length % 2 == 0 ?

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

This experience is going to focus on decoupling the frontend from the backend into two separate projects. For details here.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

Optionally, captured the new returned `IDisposable` and dispose it if you later wish to undo the effects of the call.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.AddDataAnnotationsValidation(EditContext)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.forms.editcontextdataannotationsextensions.adddataannotationsvalidation?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/458","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation\" (#458)"},{"Id":"848690041","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T18:24:35","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"457","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Java Client updated to RxJava3","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis issue template is for use in opening issues that document breaking changes.

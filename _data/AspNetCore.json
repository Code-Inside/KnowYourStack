[I think here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/52364da7f2d8e8956085a92c2f6b9dae48ac130d/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplicationBuilder.cs#L433)\r\n\r\nAny person who is searching about this problem, will find that they need to use `UseForwardedHeaders` but that will only add the middleware after the Authentication and Autorization middlewares are already in the pipeline, so the transformation of the Request.Scheme was not applied yet when redirect to login in happening.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\n// add my services\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\r\n{\r\n    ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedHost | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Use rest of the middlewares\r\n...\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne solution is to add the `UseAuthorization` and `UseAuthentication` after the forwarded headers:\r\n\r\n// Use rest of the middlewares\r\n```\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\r\n{\r\n    ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedHost | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.UseAuthentication();\r\napp.UseAuthorization();\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way we ensure that the correct order is applied.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI think the best scenario would be so that automatically added `AuthorizationMiddleware` and `AuthenticationMiddleware` would be added after the `ForwardedHeadersMiddleware` if that was specifically registered, but that is probably quite hard to archive.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be at least to update the docs to clearly say that using `UseForwardedHeaders` will require you to specifically add `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization` as those which are automatically registered will not consider forwarded headers.\r\n\r\nAlso, explicitly adding `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization` to the blazor template with authentication can be considered. In that case, people will add `UseForwardedHeaders` before that.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/52707","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] [Authentication] RedirectToLogin from CookieHandler is not working behind a proxy\" (#52707)"},{"Id":"2034379593","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-10T13:50:41","Actor":"hgirma","Number":"52706","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor 8 issue hot reload (AutoRender / Global)","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nCreate a new Blazor Web app with AutoRender Globally\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/7586325/ae0287e7-dfda-4790-bd28-cdd9a669908b)\r\n\r\nRegistered HttpClient and a couple of simple services\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/7586325/9b2e60e9-67c6-4e3c-850b-2096c524cebb)\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking any change on a razor page where a service is injected breaks hot-reload on save.

bug\n\nTake eshop webapp as an example, an outside-click event is registered on the page, but clicking anywhere in the document will trigger the `HandleOutsideClickAsync` method, which will close the chat pop-up window. \r\nWhen you click the cart link, the shopping cart window pops up, and the chat pop-up window closes automatically.\r\n```razor\r\n@inject NavigationManager Nav\r\n\r\n<a href=\"@Nav.GetUriWithQueryParameter(\"cart\", true)\">cart</a>  @* /?cart=true *@\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    private async Task HandleOnOutsideClickAsync() {\r\n        Nav.NavigateTo(Nav.GetUriWithQueryParameter(\"chat\", false)); // /?chat=false\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when `HandleOutsideClickAsync` triggers earlier than `HandleOutsideClickAsync`, it becomes:\r\n1. initial url: `/?chat=true` \r\n2. cart link clicked: `/?chat=true&cart=true` \r\n3. NavigateTo in outside click:`/chat=false`\r\n\r\nThe third result is not what I want, the correct one should be `/?chat=false&cart=true`\r\n\r\nMy current solution is:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nprivate async Task HandleOnOutsideClickAsync() {\r\n    await Task.Delay(100); // <- here\r\n    Nav.NavigateTo(Nav.GetUriWithQueryParameter(\"chat\", false)); // /?chat=false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. initial url: `/?chat=true`\r\n2. cart link clicked: `/?chat=true&cart=true`\r\n3. NavigateTo in outside click: `/chat=false&cart=true`\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

A previously specified `BindingInfo.BindingSource` is never overwritten.\r\n2. A complex type parameter, registered in the DI container, is assigned `BindingSource.Services`.\r\n3. A complex type parameter, not registered in the DI container, is assigned `BindingSource.Body`.\r\n4. Parameter with a name that appears as a route value in ANY route template is assigned `BindingSource.Path`.\r\n5.

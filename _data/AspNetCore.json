It's my understanding that the model binder behaves the same way in both cases, and so I would expect `ApiExplorer` to follow suit. Here's an example of the relevant `ApiExplorer` data (serialized as JSON): \r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"relativePath\": \"Test/Get1\",\r\n    \"httpMethod\": \"GET\",\r\n    \"parameters\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"Foo\",\r\n        \"source\": {\r\n          \"displayName\": \"Query\",\r\n          \"id\": \"Query\",\r\n          \"isGreedy\": false,\r\n          \"isFromRequest\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"modelType\": \"System.String\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"Bar\",\r\n        \"source\": {\r\n          \"displayName\": \"Query\",\r\n          \"id\": \"Query\",\r\n          \"isGreedy\": false,\r\n          \"isFromRequest\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"modelType\": \"System.String\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"relativePath\": \"Test/Get2\",\r\n    \"httpMethod\": \"GET\",\r\n    \"parameters\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"headerParams\",\r\n        \"source\": {\r\n          \"displayName\": \"Header\",\r\n          \"id\": \"Header\",\r\n          \"isGreedy\": true,\r\n          \"isFromRequest\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"modelType\": \"ApiExplorerIssue.Controllers.CustomParams\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n```\r\n> git clone git@github.com:domaindrivendev/ApiExplorerIssue.git\r\n> cd ApiExplorerIssue\r\n> git checkout from-header-property-bindings\r\n> dotnet run\r\n\r\nThen navigate to \"http://localhost:5000/apidescriptions\" to see the ApiExplorer data\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- ASP.NET Core version: 5.0\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29931","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ApiExplorer handles [FromHeader] binding (on complex type) differently to [FromQuery] binding\" (#29931)"},{"Id":"802179283","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T13:48:21","Actor":"Ibrahim-Islam","Number":"29928","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to bind to http://localhost:5000 on the IPv6 loopback interface: 'Cannot assign requested address'","State":"open","Body":"\r\n### Describe the bug\r\nMy ASP.NET Core 5 application works fine locally in Mac/Windows when debugging through VS Code, Rider or VS.

However, It's not uncommon to want to _slightly_ tweak the behavior of specific pieces, and to that end, aspnet has done a wonderful job of parameterizing pretty much every component in the framework. One area that could use improvement is supporting asynchronous, non-blocking validation of security tokens. The existing `ISecurityTokenValidator` defines a blocking API for validating `SecurityToken` objects  and creating a `ClaimsPrincipal` representing the data provided in the token.\r\n\r\nAnother way to enable asynchronous validation of tokens is by refactoring existing authentication handlers to perform token validation in its own asynchronous method. Consider `JwtBearerHandler.HandleAuthenticateAsync`, which handles resolving the token from potentially multiple sources and then validating the resolved token. Validation currently happens within this same method block by looping through the provided `JwtBearerOptions.SecurityTokenValidators` which synchronously validate the token.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to updating`ISecurityTokenValidator` to support asynchronous invocations, is to refactor authentication handlers such that token validation is performed in its own virtual method returning a `ClaimsPrincipal`. The default implementations would continue to execute synchronously via the configured list of `ISecurityTokenValidator`, however, this would provide framework consumers the chance to override this method and perform custom token validation.\r\n\r\n### My Work Around\r\n\r\nI'm using a custom identity server for the generation and validation of json web tokens. What makes this difficult to integrate into the existing set of authentication handlers is that it doesn't communicate over HTTP, but rather over a custom messaging protocol used by our system. My workaround is to subclass the `JwtBearerHandler` and override it's `HandleAuthenticateAsync` method.

This would  maintain the synchronous execution for all of the existing validators while also providing framework consumers the flexibility to implement potentially asynchronous token validation. For my particular case, I would be able to implement a custom `ISecurityTokenValidator` that reaches out to our identity server using our custom message protocol and add it to the `JwtBearerOptions.SecurityTokenValidators` list and everything else would be on the 'happy path'.\r\n\r\nI think the refactoring of authentication handlers seems to be an easier, less risky way to achieve my desired goal of asynchronous token validation, but probably shouldn't be done for this sole purpose. I do think, however, that the authentication handlers would benefit from a mechanical refactoring aimed at making them easier and more friendly to subclassing. This would provide framework consumers with even more flexibility over authentication as some things can't be communicated through options.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Work Around Suggestions?\r\n\r\nOn a final note, if anyone reading this has suggestions for an approach better than my above detailed workaround, by all means, please share. I did look into using a remote authentication scheme, but it seemed like **a lot** more work when all I wanted to do was make token validation happen on another server via a custom message protocol. I got about half way through prototyping it when I decided it was too much code and too risky from a security standpoint. I find it to be a much safer option to rely on existing and battle tested aspnetcore code vs rolling my own.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my issue!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29917","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support Asynchronous JWT Validation\" (#29917)"},{"Id":"801669382","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-04T22:03:06","Actor":"halter73","Number":"29915","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add benchmarks for MapAction","State":"open","Body":"Create a suite of benchmarks at aspnet/benchmarks to cover most common user scenarios involving [MapAction](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29684) so we can start comparing perf over time vs middleware and normal MVC controllers on https://aka.ms/aspnet/benchmarks.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

All breaking changes to nullability annotations will be aggregated into this issue throughout the course of .NET 6.0.**_\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0, we have been applying nullability annotations to parts of ASP.NET Core. From the outset of this effort, [we anticipated that mistakes would be made](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/api-guidelines/nullability.md#breaking-change-guidance) in these annotations and fixes would need to be made. In .NET 6.0, we are updating some annotations that have been previously applied. Some of these changes are considered source breaking changes because it leads to the APIs being incompatible or more restrictive, or could result in build-time warnings when used in projects that have nullable reference types enabled.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27564 for further discussions.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe affected APIs had incorrect nullable reference type annotations and build warnings were either absent or incorrect.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNew build warnings will be produced and incorrect build warnings will no longer be produced for the affected APIs.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThrough feedback and further testing, the nullable annotations for the affected APIs were determined to be inaccurate.

For example, if a razor class library defined a static web asset to be served under `/folder/file.txt` and the host placed a file under `wwwroot/folder/file.txt` the file on the server would silently override the file on the Razor Class Library or Blazor Webassembly application.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core will now correctly detect when this issue happens and inform of the conflict so that users can be aware and take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis was a bug in the implementation, we never intended for static web assets to be \"overridable\" by files on the wwwroot host of the project since that leads to errors that are hard to diagnose and can result in undefined behavior changes when applications are published.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason for a file on a Razor Class Library to conflict with a file on the host by default since they are prefixed with `_content/${PackageId}` unless we are discussing Blazor Webassembly applications, which get placed by default at the root of the host url space, which makes conflicts easier. (For example, Blazor Webassembly Applications contain a favicon.ico that the host might also include in their wwwroot folder).\r\n\r\nIf the source of the conflict is a file in a Razor Class Library it normally means there is some code that copies the assets from the library into the wwwroot folder of the project. We don't recommend developers doing that since it defeats one of the main goals of static web assets which is that files don't have to be copied around, which is fundamental to get updates on the browser when the contents are updated without having to trigger a new compilation.\r\n\r\nIf despite that you want to preserve this behavior and maintain the file on the host, you can do so by removing the file from the list of static web assets with a custom MSBuild target.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the file on the razor class library or the blazor webassembly file instead of the file from the host project, just remove the file from the host project.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updated validation logic for Static Web Assets\" (#443)"},{"Id":"724794249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T19:05:24","Actor":"tatti9018","Number":"442","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"Help with feature “Control Startup class activation”\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n            .ConfigureWebHost(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.UseStartup(context => new Startup(logger));\r\n            })\r\n            .Build();\r\n```\r\nWhen I use Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly”, I get error: ‘IHostBuilder’ does not contain a definition for ‘ConfigureWebHostDefaults’\r\nWhen I set Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, project see ConfigureWebHostDefaults, but project doesn’t work….","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/442","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work\" (#442)"},{"Id":"712253766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-30T20:21:51","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5","State":"open","Body":"## Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5\r\n\r\n.NET 5 introduces a variety of [new Blazor features](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514), some of which are not compatible with certain older browsers.

Starting from ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1, all of those readonly public fields have changed to readonly public properties.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect this change to affect many developers because:\r\n\r\n * Any application or library that simply uses `.razor` files (or even manual `RenderTreeBuilder` calls) to define its components would not be referencing this type directly\r\n * The `RenderTreeFrame` type itself is regarded as an implementation detail, not intended for use outside the framework. ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later includes an analyzer that issues compiler warnings if the type is being used directly.\r\n * Even if you do reference `RenderTreeFrame` directly, this change is binary-breaking but not source-breaking. That is, your existing source code will still compile and behave properly. You will only encounter an issue if compiling against the 3.x framework and then running those binaries against the 5.0 RC1 and later framework.\r\n\r\n## Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1\r\n\r\n## Old behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` were defined as fields, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\n## New behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` are defined as properties with the same names as before, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\nIf older precompiled code has not been recompiled since this change, it may throw an exception similar to *MissingFieldException: Field not found: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame.FrameType'*.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary in order to implement some high-impact performance improvements in Blazor component rendering on ASP.NET Core 5.0 while retaining the same level of safety and encapsulation as before.\r\n\r\n## Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Blazor developers will not be affected and do not need to take action. This is most likely to affect library/package authors, but still only rarely. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* If you are developing an application, and either staying on ASP.NET Core 3.x or upgrading to 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to make any changes to your own code.\r\n   * However if you depend on a library that needs to upgrade to account for this change, then you would need to update to a newer version of that library.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support only ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to take any action. Just ensure that your `csproj` declares the `TargetFramework` value `net5.0`.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support both ASP.NET Core 3.x *and* 5.0, then check whether or not your code attempts to read any of the members of `RenderTreeFrame` (for example, evaluating `someRenderTreeFrame.FrameType`).\r\n    * Most libraries will not do that. This includes libraries that contain `.razor` components. In this case you don't need to take any action.\r\n    * However, if your library does do that, then you will need to use multitargeting to support both `netstandard2.1` and `net5.0`. First, in your `csproj`, replace the existing `<TargetFramework>` with `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`. Then instead of referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` with a fixed version number such as 3.0.0, use a conditional reference to account for both versions you wish to support. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"3.0.0\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"5.0.0-rc.1.*\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' != 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further clarification, see this [diff showing how @jsakamoto already upgraded his `Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement` library in this way](https://github.com/jsakamoto/Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement/commit/090df430ba725f9420d412753db8104e8c32bf51).\r\n\r\n## Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fields on RenderTreeFrame have become properties\" (#438)"},{"Id":"696062913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T17:46:46","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the default behavior of `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBy default, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found (i.e. the exception handler returns a 404) when the middleware executes. To allow 404 responses to be returned by the exception handler, please configure the option `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. When this option is set to true, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run. The exception thrown will be handled by the server. For example, the exception will be converted to a 500 error response by Kestrel HTTP server or HTTP.SYS server. \r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility using the current behavior, where a 404 response from the exception handler is allowed, please set `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`.

Remove uses of `DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware`in your app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n    {\r\n        app.UseDatabaseErrorPage();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Ensure `DeveloperExeptionPage` and `MigrationsEndpoint` are added to your app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n    {\r\n        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\r\n        app.UseMigrationsEndPoint();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add `DatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter` to your services:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n{\r\n    services.AddDatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter();\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n  [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.diagnostics.entityframeworkcore.databaseerrorpagemiddleware)\r\n  [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.DatabaseErrorPageExtensions.UseDatabaseErrorPage`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.databaseerrorpageextensions.usedatabaseerrorpage)\r\n\r\nSee discussion at: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24987\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/432","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting DatabaseErrorPage middleware\" (#432)"},{"Id":"677137375","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T19:27:08","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"431","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1597 | ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1597 | ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

So, starting with .NET 5 preview 7, the `.razor` compiler will omit insignificant whitespace by default.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, this will not have any effect on the visual layout of the rendered component, since the whitespace nodes being removed would not normally affect it. However, the whitespace might affect the rendered output if you are using a CSS rule like `white-space: pre`. If you need to preserve the whitespace, you can use the new directive `@preservewhitespace true` at the top of your `.razor` file, or inside an `_Imports.razor` file to apply the preference to an entire subdirectory or even your whole project.\r\n\r\nFor further discussions, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23568\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following `.razor` code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n    @foreach (var item in Items)\r\n    {\r\n        <li>\r\n            @item.Text\r\n        </li>\r\n    }\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would previously have rendered two whitespace nodes outside the `@foreach`, and then two more around the `<li>`, and then two more around `@item.Text`. If the list contained 100 items, this would have been 402 whitespace nodes - i.e., more than half of all nodes rendered, even though none of them would visually affect the rendered output. Eliminating them at compile time greatly improves performance for rendering and diffing.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes were preserved\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes are removed if:\r\n\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within an element\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within a `RenderFragment` parameter (e.g., child content being passed to another component)\r\n * ... they precede or follow a C# code block such as an `@if`, `@foreach`, etc.\r\n\r\n... except if the `@preservewhitespace` directive is used with value `true`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nPerformance. See above.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIn most cases no action is required, as applications will typically continue to behave normally (but faster).

In ASP.NET Core 2.1 we switched to using the socket transport by default, but kept libuv support around for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\nAt this point, use of the sockets transport is far more common than the libuv transport, so we're planning on obsoleting the libuv support in .NET 5.0, with a plan to remove it entirely in .NET 6.0.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, we will also plan not to add support for new OS platforms (like Windows ARM64) in the .NET 5.0 timeframe.\r\n\r\nIf you have a blocking issue that requires the use of the libuv transport, we would love to hear about it in the discussion issue at dotnet/aspnetcore#23409.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 Preview 8\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThese APIs were not Obsolete.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThey are now Obsolete.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe socket transport is now the default, and we don't know of good reasons to continue to use the Libuv transport.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nRemove the use of the Libuv package and extension methods.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [`WebHostBuilderLibuvExtensions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderlibuvextensions)\r\n* [`WebHostBuilderLibuvExtensions.UseLibuv()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderlibuvextensions.uselibuv)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv.LibuvTransportOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.transport.libuv.libuvtransportoptions)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv.LibuvTransportOptions.ThreadCount`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.transport.libuv.libuvtransportoptions.threadcount)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv.LibuvTransportOptions.NoDelay`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.transport.libuv.libuvtransportoptions.nodelay)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv.LibuvTransportOptions.MaxWriteBufferSize`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.transport.libuv.libuvtransportoptions.maxwritebuffersize)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv.LibuvTransportOptions.MaxReadBufferSize`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.transport.libuv.libuvtransportoptions.maxreadbuffersize)\r\n* [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv.LibuvTransportOptions.Backlog`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.transport.libuv.libuvtransportoptions.backlog)\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/424","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv and Libuv packages\" (#424)"},{"Id":"644818094","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-24T18:17:34","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"423","RawContent":null,"Title":"Authorization resource in endpoint routing will now be HttpContext","State":"open","Body":"## Authorization resource in endpoint routing will now be HttpContext\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, when using endpoint routing, the resource used for authorization would be the endpoint.

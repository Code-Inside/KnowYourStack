This is only occurring when using Visual Studio 2022 and .Net6, and self-hosting.\r\n\r\nI created 2 extremely simple test apps, one in VS2019/.Net5 and the other in VS2022/.Net6 (both Enterprise). They are the same except for the versions. Have tried on 3 different PCs with similar results. The CPU for the browser as viewed in Task Manager begins an upward trend until it reaches 20% +. This can take 30 minutes or more. The .Net5 app generally remains < 1%.\r\n\r\nThis occurs even if no listeners are configured, though the upward trend is much faster if messages are being received.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt is expected that the browser CPU remains low, as it does when using .Net5.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nExample is at https://github.com/bryan-arn/_SignalRCpuDev\r\n\r\nFor the example, the solution creation overview is:\r\n1. Create new Blazor app - .Net6, no authentication, no HTTPS, Core Hosted\r\n2. Add Hub class and map endpoint in Program.cs - endpoints.MapHub<ServiceHub>(\"/serviceHub\");\r\n2. Add class to use as BackgroundService, add as hosted service in Program.cs - builder.Services.AddHostedService<SignalRCpuDevService>();\r\n3. Use BackgroundService to connect to hub and send current time every second (or however long specified in delay) as string to hub.\r\n4. In Index.cs, connect to hub, add receiver for 'receiveText' method and populate label.\r\n\r\nSo it is an extremely simple SignalR app.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET

[SkipStatusCodePages]","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\n\r\n`app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(string pathFormat)` must come before any explicit call to `app.UseRouting()` in order to redo route matching with `pathFormat`. Reversing this order causes requests that should result in a status code page to result in a 404 instead because the route matching is never rerun.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that correctly putting `UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute` before `UseRouting` causes `[SkipStatusCodePages]` to be ignored. [StatusCodePagesMiddlewarechecks for ISkipStatusCodePagesMetadata](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c85baf8db0c72ae8e68643029d514b2e737c9fae/src/Middleware/Diagnostics/src/StatusCodePage/StatusCodePagesMiddleware.cs#L44) before `UseRouting` sets the metadata. (One possible fix might be to check for the metadata again after calling `_next` if `GetEndpoint()` returned `null` before calling `_next`.)\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\r\n{\r\n    app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(\"/status\");\r\n\r\n    app.UseRouting();\r\n\r\n    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>\r\n    {\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/\", () =>\r\n        {\r\n            return Results.BadRequest(); // \"Status: 400\" correctly written to body\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/skip\", [SkipStatusCodePages] () =>\r\n        {\r\n            return Results.BadRequest(); // \"Status: 400\" *incorrectly* written to body\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/status\", (HttpResponse response) =>\r\n        {\r\n            return $\"Status: {response.StatusCode}\"; // \"Status: 200\" correctly written to body when hit directly\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReversing the order leads to 404s. This is unfortunately by design, but it would be great if we could make this work similar to the way we do for the implicit `UseRouting` in `WebApplication`.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\r\n{\r\n    app.UseRouting();\r\n\r\n    app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(\"/status\");\r\n\r\n    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>\r\n    {\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/\", () =>\r\n        {\r\n            return Results.BadRequest(); // Empty 404 response\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/skip\", [SkipStatusCodePages] () =>\r\n        {\r\n            return Results.BadRequest(); // Empty 404 response\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/status\", (HttpResponse response) =>\r\n        {\r\n            return $\"Status: {response.StatusCode}\"; // \"Status: 200\" correctly written to body when hit directly\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `WebApplication` is used instead with its implicit call to `UseRouting`, everything works correctly. Rerouting does not 404 and `[SkipStatusCodePages]` is respected. This is thanks to @BrennanConroy's work in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/35426. Maybe we could do something similar for non-`WebApplication` scenarios.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(\"/status\");\r\n\r\n// Adding app.UseRouting() here would reintroduce the broken behavior of ignoring [SkipStatusCodePages]\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () =>\r\n{\r\n    return Results.BadRequest(); // \"Status: 400\" correctly written to body\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/skip\", [SkipStatusCodePages] () =>\r\n{\r\n    return Results.BadRequest(); // Correct empty 400 response because /status is skipped\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/status\", (HttpResponse response) =>\r\n{\r\n    return $\"Status: {response.StatusCode}\"; // \"Status: 200\" correctly written to body when hit directly\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore context from previous work in this area: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/38509#issuecomment-977236239\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`[SkipStatusCodePages]` should be respected and rerouting should not 404.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\r\n{\r\n    app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(\"/status\");\r\n\r\n    app.UseRouting();\r\n\r\n    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>\r\n    {\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/\", () =>\r\n        {\r\n            return Results.BadRequest(); // \"Status: 400\" correctly written to body\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/skip\", [SkipStatusCodePages] () =>\r\n        {\r\n            return Results.BadRequest(); // Correct empty 400 response because /status is skipped\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/status\", (HttpResponse response) =>\r\n        {\r\n            return $\"Status: {response.StatusCode}\"; // \"Status: 200\" correctly written to body when hit directly\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n7.0.100-alpha.1.22060.1","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39472","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute should respect [SkipStatusCodePages]\" (#39472)"},{"Id":"1100954823","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-13T00:35:04","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"39471","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref needs to be produced and versioned correctly in servicing for source-build","State":"open","Body":"Currently building release/6.0 for 6.0.1 doesn't produce a Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref package.

Basically I set the base path for ANC using `app.UsePathBase(\"/foo\")` in `Program.cs` and then have a routing rule matching `/foo/*` and `/foo/` in Azure Front Door which will forward to the Blazor server app (hosted on Azure App Services).\r\n\r\nEvery thing works fine when I navigate to `https://example.com/foo/`. But when I navigate to `https://example.com/FoO/` Blazor will fail to initialize the circuit, and in developer tools I can see the following logs. No exceptions or anything on the server though.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-01-12T18:49:30.095Z] Error: The circuit failed to initialize. blazor.server.js:1:115531\r\n[2022-01-12T18:49:30.096Z] Information: Connection disconnected. blazor.server.js:1:36859\r\nUncaught (in promise) Error: Invocation canceled due to the underlying connection being closed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter adjusting log level on the server side I saw the following log which caught my eye:\r\n```\r\nReceived hub invocation: InvocationMessage { \r\n   InvocationId: \"0\",\r\n   Target: \"StartCircuit\",\r\n   Arguments: [\r\n      https://example.com/foo/,\r\n      https://example.com/FoO/,\r\n      [{\"type\":\"server\",\"sequence\":0,\"descriptor\":\"...\"},{\"type\":\"server\",\"sequence\":1,\"descriptor\":\"...\"}],\r\n   ], StreamIds: [  ]\r\n}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that the case mismatch in `baseUri` (`https://example.com/foo/`) and `uri` (`https://example.com/FoO/`) is because Azure Front Door will forward according to the matching rules (which are case-insensitive). So because the matching rule is `/foo` the forwarded path will be `/foo`. The `uri` I believe is just `location.href` in Blazor JS side.\r\n\r\nAfter following the code I noticed that the case mismatch above will lead to an exception in `NavigationManager`.\r\n```\r\nThe URI 'https://example.com/FoO/' is not contained by the base URI 'https://example/foo/'.\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v6.0.0/src/Components/Server/src/ComponentHub.cs#L133\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v6.0.0/src/Components/Server/src/Circuits/CircuitFactory.cs#L63\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v6.0.0/src/Components/Components/src/NavigationManager.cs#L161\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v6.0.0/src/Components/Components/src/NavigationManager.cs#L82\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v6.0.0/src/Components/Components/src/NavigationManager.cs#L305\r\n\r\nThe case mismatch will NOT happen if i navigate directly to the Azure App Service. `StartCircuit` is invoked with arguments `https://example.com/FoO/, https://example.com/FoO/, [....]`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPath should be case-insensitive when hosted behind a reverse-proxy.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create new Blazor Server App\r\n2. Add Azure SignalR (needed when using behind Azure Front Door)\r\n    a) Install NuGet package `Microsoft.Azure.SignalR`\r\n    b)  Add `builder.Services.AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR();` to `Program.cs`\r\n3) Adjust base path \r\n   a) `app.UsePathBase(\"/foo\");` to `Program.cs`\r\n4) Publish to Azure App Service\r\n4) Create Azure Front Door and configure\r\n   a) Add backend pool, point to Azure App Service\r\n   b) Add routing rule with match patterns `/foo/` and `/foo/*` which forwards to backend pool created in previous step.\r\n\r\nIf above steps are not enough, I could either try creating a minimal repro with Bicep templates, or if possible try to reproduce everything locally using YARP instead of Azure Front Door. Let me know if you need more info.\r\n\r\nThe root cause however is simple to reproduce (NavigationManager throwing exception):\r\n```csharp\r\nvar foo = new FooNavigatioManager();\r\nfoo.Init(\"https://example.com/foo/\", \"https://example.com/FoO/\");\r\n\r\nclass FooNavigatioManager : NavigationManager\r\n{\r\n    public void Init(string baseUri, string uri) => Initialize(baseUri, uri);\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\r\nThe URI 'https://example.com/FoO/' is not contained by the base URI 'https://example/foo/'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's actually swallowed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v6.0.0/src/Components/Server/src/ComponentHub.cs#L158\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\nRelated\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23107\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/6818","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39469","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor Server behind reverse-proxy is case sensitive when app base path is changed\" (#39469)"},{"Id":"1100760553","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-12T20:28:12","Actor":"dredav","Number":"39468","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor virtualization can't work with `flex-wrap: wrap` and grid layouts","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHi there 👋 \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to deal with the blazor virtualization... so I'm opening here an issue.\r\n\r\n## What I'm trying to archive\r\nI want to use the virtualization to render items. I'm using a flex layout and will wrap (`lex-wrap: wrap`) these items when the width is fully used. The first items will be rendered as expected (as long you didn't touch the scrollbar). When starting scrolling all items will flicker and the control insn't usable anymore. \r\n\r\nCode example: https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/GQublwQk09jdnEVr22\r\n![virtualize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/731073/149216400-7fa6db0c-1a55-4b54-b533-eb3e1e28e220.gif)\r\n\r\n## Grid isn't a alternative\r\nI also try to change the layout to a grid based one. That works fine, but the first and last item is a blazor virtualization `<div height=0` item, which will use a grid column itself. I found a GH issue which says that virtualization will not work with grid layouts.\r\n\r\nSet the special div items to `display: none` will break the virtualization too.\r\n```css\r\n.grid-virtualize > :first-child,\r\n.grid-virtualize > :last-child{\r\n display: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Looking forward\r\nSo I'cant use a grid layout and can't use a flex layout with wrapping here in't a creat experience. Currently I think the implementation of blazors virtualization has some \"design issues\" when working with external css and I should remove it for my use-case.\r\n\r\nIs there any recomended layout guids for blazors virtualization? Also are there any other solution to get the virtualization  working in my case?\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n6.0.100\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39468","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor virtualization can't work with `flex-wrap: wrap` and grid layouts\" (#39468)"},{"Id":"1100749331","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-12T20:14:24","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"39467","RawContent":null,"Title":"[SPA] Update NPM dependencies for dotnet 3.1","State":"open","Body":"## Description\r\n\r\nUpdates our NPM dependencies on the templates to keep them up to date.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nWe regularly update our template NPM dependencies to keep them up to date with existing versions of NPM packages.

This should send a message to all users, including the one that sent the message, because the user could have the chat open on several devices, and this allows their other devices to get the chat message.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I'd like to avoid sending the chat message to the specific original client/device that sent the message. Since most chat messages are between two users in the system, this would cut my message send by almost half if I could do this. This could be achieved with a method `IHubClients.UsersExceptClients()`, which would let me specify what users to send to (where each user can have several clients) but to exclude a specific client (and I'd send in the connection id from the client side to the server for this purpose).\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add this feature?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39462","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature request for SignalR: IHubClients.UsersExceptClients()\" (#39462)"},{"Id":"1100576319","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-12T16:59:38","Actor":"farinha","Number":"39461","RawContent":null,"Title":"Polymorphic binder on collection attempts to bind an extra element","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nUsing [Polymorphic model binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/advanced/custom-model-binding?view=aspnetcore-5.0#polymorphic-model-binding) with a collection of objects that are rendered using a custom editor template via `@Html.EditorFor()` I came across some weird behaviour (bug?) during the binding where the binding mechanism seems to be attempting to bind a non-existing item.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/farinha/aspnetcore-binding-issue\r\n\r\nPlace a breakpoint on `BindModelAsync` to be able to step through the issue.\r\n\r\nRun the project and once the page loads point it to `/Device`.

Please describe.\r\n- I want my app to use the default layout when the user is logged in, and a different layout when they are not logged in.\r\n- (This is because my default layout contains sidebar and nav bar options which are only relevant for logged in users).\r\n- However, the `AuthorizeRouteView` component only allows setting a `DefaultLayout` parameter. Using `<LayoutView>` inside the `NotAuthorized` parameter doesn't override this. (`<LayoutView>` does work if no `DefaultLayout` is set, but manually setting the layout on every page isn't ideal).\r\n- This can be currently be worked around by building a custom RouteView, as described in [this previous issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/26122).\r\n- However, this seems like a common problem. As well as the issue mentioned above, [here's another issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29411) requiring the same thing, but where the developer was having trouble with the custom RouteView solution. A similar thing is being asked in [this recent StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69578655/changing-authorization-layoutt-in-blazor-wasm).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd like to be able to manually specify the layout for the `NotAuthorized` content in an `<AuthorizeRouteView>`, possibly using a `NotAuthorizedLayout` parameter. e.g.\r\n```html\r\n<AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=\"@routeData\" DefaultLayout=\"@typeof(MainLayout)\" NotAuthorizedLayout=\"@typeof(CustomLayout)\">\r\n    <NotAuthorized>\r\n        <StartPage />\r\n    </NotAuthorized>\r\n</AuthorizeRouteView>\r\n```\r\nIf there was also a `AuthorizedLayout` parameter, this could allow for more advanced customisation of the layout in the `NotAuthorized` content. e.g.\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Use MainLayout when the user is authorized to view the page -->\r\n<AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=\"@routeData\" AuthorizedLayout=\"@typeof(MainLayout)\">\r\n    <NotAuthorized>\r\n        @if (context.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated != true)\r\n        {\r\n            <!-- Use CustomLayout if the user isn't logged in -->\r\n            <LayoutView Layout=\"@typeof(CustomLayout)\">\r\n                <StartPage />\r\n            </LayoutView>\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            <!-- Use ErrorLayout if the user is logged in, but not authorized -->\r\n            <LayoutView Layout=\"@typeof(ErrorLayout)\">\r\n                <p role=\"alert\">You are not authorized to access this resource.</p>\r\n            </LayoutView>\r\n        }\r\n    </NotAuthorized>\r\n</AuthorizeRouteView>\r\n```\r\n(This currently doesn't work, because the `LayoutView` doesn't override the `DefaultLayout` parameter.)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nMany apps will want to use a different layout before the user is logged in. I think this is a common enough scenario that it would be worth adding this functionality to make it easier. The custom RouteView workaround described in the issue above didn't quite work for me; I needed to copy the entire source code for `AuthorizeRouteView` and change the part which forces the `DefaultLayout` for the `NotAuthorized` routes. This solution works fine, although achieving this does seem more complicated than it needs to be.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39456","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor's AuthorizeRouteView should allow for setting a different layout on the NotAuthorized content\" (#39456)"},{"Id":"1100101631","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-12T09:32:34","Actor":"aayjaychan","Number":"39454","RawContent":null,"Title":"`CreatedResult` should accept null location","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n[RFC7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.2) suggests that the `Location` header is optional for `201` Created response.\r\n\r\n> The primary resource created by the request is identified by either a Location header field in the response or, if no Location field is received, by the effective request URI.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently the constructors of `CreateResult` throws if `null` is passed to `location`, and `ControllerBase.Created()` throws if `null` is passed to `url`.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA response of  `201` Created without `Location` header is created.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpPost]\r\npublic ActionResult Create()\r\n{\r\n    return new CreatedResult((string?)null, null); // throws ArgumentNullException\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpPost]\r\npublic ActionResult Create()\r\n{\r\n    return Created((string?)null, null) // throws ArgumentNullException\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\r\nSystem.ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`.

Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`.

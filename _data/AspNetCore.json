Please describe the problem.\n\nAs it stands, lazy loading of modules has limitations that prevent it to be useful in real-world applications. We are designing a large enterprise app that is going to be comprised of 15-20 loosely coupled modules. Loading all modules during app initialization would cause delay during initial download of the application so it makes perfect sense to load modules dynamically.\r\n\r\nI outlined problems with current implementation in a previous ticket.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/37829\r\n\r\nWhile @javiercn did an excellent job (as always) suggesting a solution, I'm afraid this is more of a workaround that doesn't provide elegant developer experience.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n1. I would like to keep all code required to run the module inside the module itself. There shouldn't be any shared libraries required to launch the module from the hosting app, this applies to DI initialization.\r\n\r\n2. When module (assembly) is lazy loaded, allow execution of ``async`` initialization tasks inside some entry point method, maybe something similar to the proposal that was linked in the related issue:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-9.0/module-initializers\r\nThe caller should be notified when all initialization work is completed.\r\n\r\n3. This entry point method should allow registration of additional DI services that are specific to the module (assembly).\r\n\r\n4. Allow use of ``Inject`` attribute without any unnecessary ceremony.\r\n\r\n5. Load dynamically any scoped CSS for the lazy loaded module. Currently there is only a single ``css`` file for all referenced assemblies residing in the hosted app, which of course is going to grow in size as the number of modules increases.\r\n\r\nIn short, I would like to see lazy loaded modules as completely isolated units of work that don't require any setup by the hosting app. The only necessary code inside the hosting app is to load the module and get a notification when the module is loaded (or failed to load).\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration. I believe better mechanism for lazy loading of assemblies is critical to Blazor's adoption in large enterprise environments.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39622","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Feature Request for .NET 7 - Enhanced Lazy Loading\" (#39622)"},{"Id":"1106327120","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-19T02:44:05","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"39588","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix flakey HTTP/2 tests","State":"closed","Body":"Addresses https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39520","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/39588","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix flakey HTTP/2 tests\" (#39588)"},{"Id":"1107527536","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-19T01:14:18","Actor":"dougbu","Number":"39620","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/6.0] Always build App.Ref and the targeting packs","State":"open","Body":"- remove `$(IsTargetingPackBuilding)` entirely\r\n- 6.0.x version of #39568","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/39620","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/6.0] Always build App.Ref and the targeting packs\" (#39620)"},{"Id":"1106298314","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-19T01:01:58","Actor":"dougbu","Number":"39587","RawContent":null,"Title":"Always build App.Ref and the targeting packs (subset)","State":"closed","Body":"- set `$(IsTargetingPackBuilding)` to `true` unconditionally\r\n- subset of #39568","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/39587","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Always build App.Ref and the targeting packs (subset)\" (#39587)"},{"Id":"1107469685","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-18T23:38:51","Actor":"sebastienros","Number":"39619","RawContent":null,"Title":"Respect -noBuildNative for Kestrel","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/39619","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Respect -noBuildNative for Kestrel\" (#39619)"},{"Id":"1107402428","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-18T21:56:59","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"39618","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding warning log when no actions detected","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #39126\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/39618","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Adding warning log when no actions detected\" (#39618)"},{"Id":"1107368550","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-18T21:14:24","Actor":"ryanbrandenburg","Number":"39616","RawContent":null,"Title":"`@typeparam TItem;` causes invalid syntax tree due to missing \";\"","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf a user has a `typeparam` directive with a `;` the `;` is omitted from the SyntaxTree.

In doing so, it has come to light that the extension methods for **IEndpointConventionBuilder** are inconsistently implemented and many of them have little-to-no usably by other extensions such as API Versioning.\r\n\r\nThe primary issues relate to [OpenApiRouteHandlerBuilderExtensions.cs](../blob/main/src/Http/Routing/src/Builder/OpenApiRouteHandlerBuilderExtensions.cs). These extensions are very likely to be used by customers in conjunction with API Versioning, but cannot be for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. **RouteHandlerBuilder** is `sealed`\r\n2. The extensions methods accept and return the concrete `RouteHandlerBuilder` type\r\n\r\nFor completeness, a similar problem exists for [FallbackEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs](../blob/main/src/Http/Routing/src/Builder/FallbackEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs). Fallback endpoints are not expected to be used with API Versioning, but it could affect other extensions. These extension methods accept and return **IEndpointConventionBuilder**, which makes them more usable than **OpenApiRouteHandlerBuilderExtensions**; however, the lack of passing through a more specific type means that the order setup by developers matters.\r\n\r\nThe design and implementation of each set of extension methods appears to have been done by different people, at different times, and with different design review considerations.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nThere doesn't appear to be a clear reason why these decisions were made. There seems to be no reason to not implement all of the extension methods using the same approach that @JamesNK used in [RoutingEndpointConventionBuilderExtensions.cs](../blob/main/src/Http/Routing/src/Builder/RoutingEndpointConventionBuilderExtensions.cs). This would mean that all extension methods have the form of:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static TBuilder SomeExtension<TBuilder>(this TBuilder builder) where TBuilder : IEndpointConventionBuilder { } \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach appears to have been lightly discussed in #8902 previously, which might explain why future extension methods did not follow suite.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change would benefit not just API Versioning, but any other extension that needs to add/change significant parts of the default _Minimal API_ implementation.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nChanging the signature of the existing APIs are a breaking change, but I believe that adding the intended generic implementations can live side-by-side with the existing non-generic variants.\r\n\r\nIf the proposal were accepted, when would that happen? As it stands, this issue cascades across APIs. API Versioning would be required to reimplement all of the applicable, existing extension methods to retain feature parity for non-versioned _Minimal APIs_. Furthermore, the unnecessary non-generic extensions methods have to be retained just as they do in ASP.NET Core - likely forever more. If API Versioning doesn't reimplement the extensions methods, then there is a feature gap that must be filled by customers.\r\n\r\nAPI Versioning is looking for guidance to achieve the right level of synergy in both the short and long terms.\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\nThe tentative design for _Minimal APIs_ for API Versioning will look something like:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\napp.DefineApi()\r\n   .HasVersion(1.0)\r\n   .HasVersion(2.0)\r\n   .ReportApiVersions()\r\n   .HasMapping(api => {\r\n       // OpenAPI extensions cannot be used here without reimplementing and maintaining them\r\n   \tapi.MapGet(\"/speak\", () => \"Hello world!\");\r\n   \tapi.MapPost(\"/speak\", (string text) => text).MapToApiVersion(2.0);\r\n   });\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc: @davidfowl @JamesNK ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39604","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Design: IEndpointConventionBuilder Extensions Unusable By Other Extensions\" (#39604)"},{"Id":"1107093414","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-18T16:12:20","Actor":"groogiam","Number":"39603","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor Download File From Stream Error","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe documentation here results in an error. \r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/file-downloads?view=aspnetcore-6.0\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n@code {\r\n    private async Task DownloadFileFromStream()\r\n    {\r\n        var fileStream = GetFileStream();\r\n        var fileName = \"log.bin\";\r\n\r\n        //the using statement here causes an exception.\r\n        using var streamRef = new DotNetStreamReference(stream: fileStream);\r\n\r\n        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(\"downloadFileFromStream\", fileName, streamRef);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCode should not result in an exception.

Please describe the problem.\n\nI've had issues in the past with the check session being too aggressive. I think I have my Blazor WASM project working correctly now, but it would be nice to have the option to work around the checksession loop issue that some experience. The issue I was experiencing is the checksession iframe would be stuck in a loop of executing the creation of a connect authorize iframe every 1 second. It is happening behind the scenes, but it gets very chatty on the wire and the browser keeps acting like it is loading.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe oidc-client-js library allowed for setting the checkSessionInterval. Something exposed like this in the AddOidcAuthentication IServiceCollection extension options would be nice as a way to work around the looping issue or just make the check session less aggressive. I'm assuming those involved in this project know of oidc-client-js project, but here it is anyway.\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39589","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add CheckSessionInterval option to OIDC authentication\" (#39589)"},{"Id":"1106155031","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-17T18:27:24","Actor":"vivekgunnala-sl","Number":"39586","RawContent":null,"Title":"Authentication Error with Latest Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authetication.JwtBearer(6.0.1)","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAs part of our package upgrades, we have updated to the latest Authentication.JwtBearer package.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`.

Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`.

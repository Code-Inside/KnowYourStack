This needs to be expanded now to serve dynamic content from hostfxr or potentially from ANCM. Along with checking if disableStartupErrorPage is set, writing text/plain vs text/html, status codes, substatus codes, etc, having a single application to handle multiple failure points has become unmanageable. \r\n\r\nI think we should probably redesign how we server error responses. My initial idea was to create an ENUM or key off of HRESULT to know what type of error occurred, and change the type of application/handler to create. An example of this is what I did with hostfxr errors, where I create a new handler and application. I think the best approach is to create a unique application/handler per type of error which just serves a single type of failure. Then, per each failure type, we can add more dynamic data (like stack trace, hresult, doc link, etc.) when running in development. There may be a good amount of duplication, but trying to cram everything into the same class is getting worse and worse (see ServerApplication.cpp).\r\n\r\nIf this plan looks good, I'll go ahead and follow through. I just want to confirm with _someone_ before I do a decently size refactoring.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/10282","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Write Premain errors to the response and Log \" (#10282)"},{"Id":"444691142","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T23:40:26","Actor":"kevinlo","Number":"10281","RawContent":null,"Title":"Infinite loop when Signout at CookieAuthenticationEvents.ValidatePrincipal","State":"open","Body":"I follow the sample codes this [ASP.NET Core Cookie Authentication document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/cookie?view=aspnetcore-2.2) to do session validation during the CookieAuthenticationEvents.ValidatePrincipal event and signout if the session is invalid.

to get the id token hint from the cookie which trigger the ValidatePrincipal again and it causes the infinite loop.\r\n\r\nI have tried doing that two SignOutAsync synchronously so it signout the openid one first and then the cookie one.  But then the oidc one can't find the id hint and the LogoutMessage is missing the ClientId and PostLogoutRedirectUri.  \r\n\r\nMy current issue is if the user close the browser tab only, the cookie is still there.  After certain time, the user launch our app url again, the cookie is still valid, but the session in our repository is expired and I need to logout that user and redirect to the login page.   I find that, depending on the timing, the RejectPrincipal will redirect to the Identity Provider.  If the async openid signout is not completed, it will trigger the automatic login and a new session is created in our repository.  That's not what I want, I want the logout.\r\n\r\nI also try the following by passing the AuthenticationProperties with RedirectUri to the SignOutAsync, but it does not redirect to that page.\r\n\r\n                                var props = new AuthenticationProperties()\r\n                                {\r\n                                    RedirectUri = \"myapp/Home\"\r\n                                };\r\n                                await context.HttpContext.SignOutAsync(\"oidc\", props );\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the right way to signout during ValidatePrincipal?\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10281","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Infinite loop when Signout at CookieAuthenticationEvents.ValidatePrincipal\" (#10281)"},{"Id":"444690102","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T23:35:17","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"10280","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable SameSite for AzureAd and B2C cookies ","State":"open","Body":"#9115\r\n https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/348\r\n\r\nWe've previously disabled SameSite for many OAuth/OIDC scenarios, but we haven't done it for the cookies added by AddAzureAd and AddAzureAdB2C.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for these scenarios is not discoverable.

This works for most types of views except the ones used by view components. As the `ViewComponent` view location is [hard coded in a constant string](https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/e985fa5d423968f36a651a354d9c953192c52532/src/Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.ViewFeatures/ViewComponents/ViewViewComponentResult.cs#L20\r\n) and the methods inside the `ViewViewComponentResult` are impossible to override, `ViewComponent` views will have to reside in the location `Components/<ViewComponentName>/<ViewName>` with the only option of prepending or appending something to this constant string.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1. Create a class called `MyViewComponent` inheriting from the `ViewComponent` class in a folder that doesn't adhere to default `ViewComponent` location, for instance in the project root.\r\n2. Create a view called `Default.cshtml` adjacent to the `MyViewComponent` class.\r\n3. `return View(\"Default\");` in the `InvokeAsync` method of the `MyViewComponent` class.\r\n4. Render `MyViewComponent` with `@await Component.InvokeAsync(\"MyViewComponent\")` in the `Home` view, for instance.\r\n5.

I thought it could use more discussion here.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <MyComp Open=\"false\">\r\n        <HeaderTitle>\r\n             @if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(hdr)) {\r\n                 ...\r\n                <div class=\"flex-grow\"> @hdr </div>\r\n            }\r\n        </HeaderTitle>\r\n        <Detail>\r\n            ...\r\n        </Detail>\r\n   </MyComp>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the root issue is that it is not simple to set `HeaderTitle=null`. The only way to do this is to **not** include it in `MyComp`. So you have to write something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(hdr)) {\r\n    <MyComp Open=\"false\">\r\n        <HeaderTitle>... </HeaderTitle>\r\n        <Detail>... </Detail>\r\n   </MyComp>\r\n} else {\r\n    <MyComp Open=\"false\">\r\n        <!-- HeaderTitle=null --!>\r\n        <Detail>... </Detail>\r\n   </MyComp>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to have a `RenderFragment.IsEmpty` function \r\nOr something like `<HeaderTitle ExcludeIf=true>... </HeaderTitle>`\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10270","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How pass RenderFragment template=null to a Component\" (#10270)"},{"Id":"444655460","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T21:33:50","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"10273","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add ForwardedHeaders to CreateDefaultBuilder","State":"open","Body":" #4135 This enables apps to conditionally enable ForwardedHeaders when published to places like Azure Web Apps Linux.

So I need to make two calls:\r\n````csharp\r\n_userManager.ChangeEmailAsync(...);\r\n_userManager.SetUserNameAsync(...);\r\n````\r\n\r\nIf one of those two calls fail, then the user's account will be left in an inconsistent state. At worst, he'll lose his account.\r\n\r\nThere is also the possibility of someone else using the new email address during those two change operations - which would then leave two accounts in an inconsistent state.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nThis race condition can be avoided by dealing with the underlying `IdentityDbContext` directly. But that requires significant effort (because `UserManager` does much more than just set entity properties).\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nWe need a new method that performs the operation atomically. For example:\r\n\r\n````csharp\r\n_userManager.ChangeEmailAndUsernameAsync(...);\r\n````\r\n\r\nIt should run within a transaction, and if either sub-operation fails, then the entire thing should fail.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10260","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Feature Request] Atomic operation for ChangeEmailAsync and SetUserNameAsync\" (#10260)"},{"Id":"444525592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T19:00:20","Actor":"natemcmaster","Number":"10267","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace all usages of RepositoryRoot with RepoRoot","State":"closed","Body":"Part of #7280 (converging to Arcade)\r\n\r\nThe Arcade SDK uses a different variable name.

This creates two problems:\r\n\r\n1. In distributed testing on Helix, the source code is not present, only test binaries. Tests which rely on deployers are currently disabled\r\n2. Simply copying the source code into a distributed test environment is insufficient because the projects are not currently written to build in a clean, vanilla \"dotnet build\" context.\r\n\r\n### Potential solutions\r\n\r\nTwo options:\r\n\r\n1. build test assets along with the test project and copy the test assets _as binaries_ into the test output. Deployers run on binaries (`dotnet foo.dll`) instead of on source (`dotnet publish && dotnet run`)\r\n2. change the test asset code to be buildable in a 'vanilla' build context - don't build locally, only during test time. Deployers work the same, but test code should not build in VS or during build.cmd with the rest of the repo -- the code only builds during test execution.\r\n\r\nOption 1 is preferable because it is easier to ensure the code can compile when we change APIs, and in many cases we're not especially interested in testing the behavior of the SDK.\r\n\r\nOption 2 has some marginal benefit in that it reduces the up-front build time of the repo and makes the test payload smaller.\r\n\r\ncc @Tratcher @anurse ","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10268","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tests which use deployers do not work on Helix\" (#10268)"},{"Id":"444285148","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T16:30:28","Actor":"PeterJD","Number":"10255","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor Question","State":"closed","Body":"Hi\r\nUsing blazor Local client (or Host local)  libraries need to be downloaded\r\n\r\nIf I have business app where users repeatly use the Business application will the  down load be repeated.\r\n\r\nOr can this be a one off ?\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10255","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blazor Question\" (#10255)"},{"Id":"444405884","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T16:26:23","Actor":"kmuthukumar23","Number":"10263","RawContent":null,"Title":"Embed script support in Blazor server-side application","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\nIn blazor Client side, the .js files are referred automatically.

So far I couldn't find any exceptions related to the anti forgery token which also makes use of `DataProtection`.\r\n\r\n- My initial guess what that some of the old cookies on the client browser are still encrypted with the key material from the fileshare. Our session cookie has an expiration time of 15 minutes which could only be explained if some users wouldn't have closed their browser for over a month.\r\n\r\n- For the EF key storage provider I now also use `SetApplicationName(\"XY\")`.

file","State":"closed","Body":"I'm still figuring out whether there are any drawbacks or problems with this, but so far it seems to be working great. Opening this PR now in case others have insight into the practicality of it.\r\n\r\nPreviously, if dependency projects were not loaded in the solution, the build would fail in VS. However with the current version of VS (16.1.0 Preview 3), it now appears to handle this scenario just fine, assuming you've already done at least one command-line build.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a [solution filter file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/filtered-solutions?view=vs-2019) `ComponentsNoDeps.slnf` you can optionally use instead of `Components.sln`. This makes VS only load the 28 projects under `src/Components` and *not* the whole set of 94 projects if transitive project references are included. For me, this means:\r\n\r\n * VS open in a couple of seconds compared with about 30 seconds before\r\n * A cold (first-time) full-solution build is now about 15-20 seconds (mostly spent in the Mono linker) versus about 1-2 minutes before.\r\n * A warm (not much changed) full-solution build is now about 10 seconds versus about 30 seconds before\r\n * Test explorer and debugging still work and are much quicker starting/updating\r\n\r\nAm I really behind the curve and everyone else was already doing this?

In my test setup, the server works on that zip file for **100s**. During the call, the server prepares a zip file and returns a link to that file once finished. The server frequently sends status updates to the client.\r\n\r\nWith logs enabled on both sides and also using wireshark, I can see that the client sends pings regularly. However, if I get the source code right, the server does not process these pings due to the pending await call. The following happes:\r\n\r\n- after 30s, the server detects that no new message was received but continues without complains (I think this is intended)\r\n- after 60s, the server detects again that no frame was received and tries to abort the connection, but the invoked method continues to run. **At this point, the client is not receiving status updates anymore from the server.**\r\n- after 90s, the server detects again that no frame was received and tries to abort the connection, but the invoked method continues to run\r\n- **after 100s**, the invoked method returns, and **the connection is actually aborted**. ```OnDisconnectedAsync``` is called. On the client side, the error \"A task was cancelled\" appears. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is by design (i.e. '_don't use async/await for very long running methods_'), or if this is a bug, since the pings from the client are not processed.\r\n\r\nIf it is by design, what is the recommended alternative, when a client needs to wait for a long running methods?\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nHub content:\r\n```cs\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n\r\nnamespace WebApplication1\r\n{\r\n    public class Broadcaster : Hub<IBroadcaster>\r\n    {\r\n        public Task<string> GetUrl()\r\n        {\r\n            int counter = 0;\r\n\r\n            return Task.Run(async () =>\r\n            {\r\n                for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)\r\n                {\r\n                    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));\r\n                    await this.Clients.Client(this.Context.ConnectionId).SendProgress(counter, \"Progress\");\r\n                    counter += 1;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                return \"url\";\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nCallback interface:\r\n```cs\r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n\r\nnamespace WebApplication1\r\n{\r\n    public interface IBroadcaster\r\n    {\r\n        Task SendProgress(double percent, string message);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nClient:\r\n```cs\r\n _connection.On(\"SendProgress\", (double percent, string message) =>\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine($\"{percent,3:0}%: {message}\\n\");\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar url = await _connection.InvokeAsync<string>(\"GetUrl\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI would expect that during an active connection where the client sends ping messages and server sends status updates, the connection is not cancelled.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nInclude the output of `dotnet --info`\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (gemäß \"global.json\"):\r\n Version:   3.0.100-preview5-011568\r\n Commit:    b487ff10aa\r\n\r\nLaufzeitumgebung:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17763\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview5-011568\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview5-27626-15\r\n  Commit:  61f30f5a23\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.602 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.203 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100-preview5-011568 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview5-19227-01 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview5-27626-15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview5-27626-15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10257","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SignalR: Client awaiting long running server method leads to timeout on server-side\" (#10257)"},{"Id":"444286257","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T07:47:01","Actor":"TomasHubelbauer","Number":"10256","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow dotnet watch to run tools","State":"open","Body":"I'd like to request support be added for `dotnet watch` to run globally installed .NET CLI tools.\r\n\r\nMy use-case it to be able to run `dotnet-script` in a watch, like: `dotnet watch script test.csx`.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10238\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses any of following vulnerable packages:\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4<br/>1.1.0 | 1.0.11<br/>1.1.5\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` directly you may still be affected if you are using SignalR and the package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, or the highest 2.2.x `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\r\n\r\nSome of the affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App, and Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host, you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x, you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core have been using the Google+ Signin APIs to authenticate Google account users in web applications. The affected NuGet packages are [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google/) for ASP.NET Core and [Microsoft.Owin.Security.Google](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.Google/) for Microsoft.Owin with ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC. Mitigations and solutions will vary depending on which package and which version of that package you use. \r\n\r\nNote that the replacement APIs Google has provided use a different data source and format. The mitigations and solutions given below account for the structural changes but applications will need to verify the data itself still satisfies their requirements. E.g. names, e-mail addresses, profile links, profile photos, etc. may provide subtly different values than before.\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Owin with ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC\r\nFor Microsoft.Owin 3.1.0 and later a temporary mitigation is outlined [here](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetKatana/issues/251#issuecomment-449587635). Applications should do immediate testing with the mitigation to check for changes in the data format. We'll plan to release Microsoft.Owin 4.0.1 with a fix for this as soon as possible. Applications using any prior version will need to update to 4.0.1.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 1.x\r\nThe mitigation given above for [Microsoft.Owin](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetKatana/issues/251#issuecomment-449587635) can also be adapted for ASP.NET Core 1.x. As 1.x is nearing [end of life](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support-policy) and has low usage there are no plans to patch the NuGet packages for this issue.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.x\r\nFor Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google 2.x the mitigation is to replace your existing call to `AddGoogle` in `Startup` with:\r\n```c#\r\n            .AddGoogle(o =>\r\n            {\r\n                o.ClientId = Configuration[\"Authentication:Google:ClientId\"];\r\n                o.ClientSecret = Configuration[\"Authentication:Google:ClientSecret\"];\r\n                o.UserInformationEndpoint = \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo\";\r\n                o.ClaimActions.Clear();\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, \"id\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.Name, \"name\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.GivenName, \"given_name\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.Surname, \"family_name\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(\"urn:google:profile\", \"link\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.Email, \"email\");\r\n            });\r\n```\r\nApplications should do immediate testing with the mitigation to check for changes in the data format. Expect a fix for this to be included in the February 2.1 and 2.2 patches that incorperates the above reconfiguration as the new defaults. No patch is planned for 2.0 since it has reached [end of life](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support-policy).\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\nThe mitigation given for 2.x can also be used for the current 3.0 preview. In future 3.0 previews we're considering removing the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google package and directing users to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect instead. We'll follow up with the final plan. Here's how to replace `AddGoogle` with `AddOpenIdConnect` in `Startup`. This replacement can be used with ASP.NET Core 2.0 and later and can be adapted for 1.x as needed.\r\n```c#\r\n            .AddOpenIdConnect(\"Google\", o =>\r\n            {\r\n                o.ClientId = Configuration[\"Authentication:Google:ClientId\"];\r\n                o.ClientSecret = Configuration[\"Authentication:Google:ClientSecret\"];\r\n                o.Authority = \"https://accounts.google.com\";\r\n                o.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;\r\n                o.CallbackPath = \"/signin-google\"; // Or register the default \"/sigin-oidc\"\r\n                o.Scope.Add(\"email\");\r\n            });\r\n            JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/6486 for discussion.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/333","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Google+ based auth deprecation and replacement\" (#333)"},{"Id":"390815611","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-13T19:01:52","Actor":"JunTaoLuo","Number":"331","RawContent":null,"Title":"Session: obsolete APIs removed in 3.0","State":"open","Body":"This is a follow up to https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/257.

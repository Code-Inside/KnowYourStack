Like Webassembly preredering but just from a directory?\r\n\r\nOf corse the preprender would be static.\r\nBut there could be different prerendering directories for differnt users.\r\n\r\nDuring Runtime the generation should also be possible, because the side could look different depending on the runtime configuration.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40023","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor Prerendering for Static Web Apps\" (#40023)"},{"Id":"1125277068","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-06T18:20:40","Actor":"Rhywden","Number":"40022","RawContent":null,"Title":"So, how is this \"silent OIDC login\" supposed to work?","State":"open","Body":"> @StPaulis thanks for contacting us.

RuntimeViewCompiler class  hits and check for changes correctly & even a new assembly is generated on CompileAndEmit method.\r\n4. but even after successful execution of CompileAndEmit methods this part i am getting the old page:\r\n```\r\n            var loader = new RazorCompiledItemLoader();\r\n            var item = loader.LoadItems(assembly).SingleOrDefault();\r\n            var compilerDescriptor = new CompiledViewDescriptor(item);\r\n            return compilerDescriptor;\r\n```\r\nhere old page is served, no matter how many refresh/browser changes/cache disabled or whatever i tried, its always the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\ncompilation must take effect whenever file is modified without restarting the application. \r\ngetting same behavior on net 5.0.13 and net 6.0.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\ncreate a virtual file provider to serve razor from database or other alternate sources, for example explained here [mikes dotnetting](https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/301/loading-asp-net-core-mvc-views-from-a-database-or-other-location)\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar mvcBuilder = services.AddMvc();\r\nvar PhysicalFileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory());\r\nvar dBPageProvider = new DBPageProvider(serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider());\r\nvar _CompositeFileProvider = new CompositeFileProvider(dBPageProvider, PhysicalFileProvider);\r\nmvcBuilder.AddRazorRuntimeCompilation(options =>\r\n            {\r\n                options.FileProviders.Clear();\r\n                options.FileProviders.Add(dBPageProvider);\r\n            }); \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n5.0.404 & 6.0.101\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n5.0.13 and 6.0.1 both have same behavior , here is the debug window log: \r\n'ExampleApp.WebHost.exe' (CoreCLR: clrhost): Loaded '214lvyus.sb4'. \r\n'ExampleApp.WebHost.exe' (CoreCLR: clrhost): Loaded 'xxjtge4n.kns'. \r\n'ExampleApp.WebHost.exe' (CoreCLR: clrhost): Loaded 'yo23o50t.dzv'. \r\n'ExampleApp.WebHost.exe' (CoreCLR: clrhost): Loaded 'zwwusxaq.gd5'. \r\n\r\nthis is on each refresh of said page, so its loading but I think not unloading/discarding the old version.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40012","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Razor runtime compilation doesnt work second time with virtual file path providers?\" (#40012)"},{"Id":"1124901142","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-05T11:07:31","Actor":"JonPSmith","Number":"40011","RawContent":null,"Title":"Is there a way to update the user's claims when using OpenID?","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

The best approach is have a common `DateTime` holding the last time a DataKey has been changed and have a DateTime \"LastTimeClaimsWhereUpdated\" claim in the user's claims - by compared these two `DateTime`s you can decide if the user's claims / identity cookie needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nIn the individual users account provider I have used the cookie's `OnValidatePrincipal` event and added a DateTime \"LastTimeClaimsWhereUpdated\" claim to the user's claims.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'm hoping there is something I don't know about that would work with OpenId. 😄 Something like individual users account provider and its cookies `OnValidatePrincipal` event would be great, but let me know if there is anything else I could do.\r\n\r\nIf there isn't a feature already I doubt it's worth adding a new feature for my request.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm using ASP.NET Core 6","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40011","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Is there a way to update the user's claims when using OpenID?\" (#40011)"},{"Id":"1124818818","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-05T04:27:04","Actor":"groogiam","Number":"40008","RawContent":null,"Title":"RenderTreeBuilder cannot wire up EventCallback via reflection","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe following does not seem to work.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n        var evtCallbackType = typeof(EventCallback<>).MakeGenericType(refComponentType);\r\n        Func<IDataEntityViewModelInstance, Task> changedFunc = OnSelectedEntityChanged;\r\n        var evtCallback = Activator.CreateInstance(evtCallbackType, this, changedFunc);\r\n        builder.AddAttribute(10, nameof(EntityReferenceComponent<EntityStage>.SelectedEntityChanged), evtCallback);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate async Task OnSelectedEntityChanged(IDataEntityViewModelInstance arg)\r\n{\r\n //...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThrows \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nUnhandled exception rendering component: Unable to set property 'SelectedEntityChanged' on object of type 'Web.Ui.Shared.EntityEditor.EntityReferenceComponent`1[[Bd.Vm.Asset, Bd.Client, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null]]'.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`. This will not affect any typical application code as it is only a detail of the low-level platform implementation.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe property `EventArgsType` described a nonstandard, Blazor-specific category name for groups of DOM event types. For example, the `click` and `mousedown` events were both mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `mouse`. Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`. There is no longer a need to supply a Blazor-specific category name, so the old property `EventArgsType` is removed.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nIn PR [#29993](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/29993) we have introduced support for custom event arguments classes. As part of this, we no longer rely on all events fitting into a predefined set of categories.

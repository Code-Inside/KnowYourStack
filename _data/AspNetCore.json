Please describe the problem.\n\n**Problem description**\n\nIn Blazor Server, components frequently start asynchronous work during lifecycle methods such as `OnInitializedAsync`, `OnParametersSetAsync`, or event handlers.\n\nIf a component is disposed (e.g., due to navigation, conditional rendering, or circuit teardown) while such async work is still running, the async code may continue executing *after* the component has been disposed. In Blazor Server, this can lead to attempts to use disposed DI services or other invalid state.\n\nThe currently recommended pattern is to manually create a `CancellationTokenSource` per component, cancel it in `Dispose()`, and pass the token to all async operations. This is acknowledged in existing issues and guidance, but it requires repetitive boilerplate and is easy to forget.\n\nExample of the pattern developers are expected to implement today:\n\n```csharp\nprivate readonly CancellationTokenSource _componentCts = new();\n\nprotected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\n{\n    await MyService.LoadAsync(_componentCts.Token);\n}\n\nvoid IDisposable.Dispose()\n{\n    _componentCts.Cancel();\n    _componentCts.Dispose();\n}\n```\n\nThis pattern works, but it is:\n\n- non-obvious to many developers,\n- repetitive across many components,\n- and error-prone if forgotten in a single component.\n\n**Observed impact**\n\nOn slower machines or under load, async initialization may still be running when the component is disposed and DI services are torn down. Without cancellation, this can cause:\n\n- `ObjectDisposedException`\n- race conditions\n- hard-to-reproduce lifecycle bugs\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nProvide a **built-in component lifetime CancellationToken** managed by the framework.\n\nConceptually:\n- Each component instance has an associated CancellationToken representing its lifetime.\n- The framework cancels this token automatically when the component is disposed.\n- Developers can pass this token to async operations without manually managing a CancellationTokenSource.\n\n```csharp\nprotected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\n{\n    await MyService.LoadAsync(ComponentCancellationToken);\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits**\n- Eliminates repetitive boilerplate in every component with async work.\n- Makes correct cancellation behavior the default rather than a best practice.\n- Reduces subtle lifecycle bugs caused by async work running after disposal.\n- Aligns with how cancellation is already handled in other parts of .NET (e.g., request-scoped cancellation).\n\n**Scope**\nThis feature would be useful in:\n- Blazor Server (especially due to DI and circuit lifetime)\n- Blazor WebAssembly (to avoid post-disposal async execution)\n\n**Notes**\nThis proposal does not remove the ability for developers to manage their own `CancellationTokenSource` if needed. It simply provides a safe, framework-supported default that covers the most common case.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blazor: Provide a built-in component lifetime CancellationToken to cancel async work on disposal\" (#65273)"},{"Id":"3879077159","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-31T12:15:34","Actor":"miloush","Number":"65284","RawContent":null,"Title":"windows event log recording: An ISAPI reported an unhealthy condition to its worker process.","State":"open","Body":"Like @dighexode in #32098, I am finding my ASP.NET 8 process recycled with event 5078 from WAS:\n\n> An ISAPI reported an unhealthy condition to its worker process.

Please describe the problem.\n\nHi,\n\nI am the writer of the library: https://razor-components.techgems.net/\n\nI wrote it a couple of years ago after looking at the issues and noticing that as Blazor was taking priority, enhancements on the traditional CSHTML razor engine were halted.\n\nI write this one in hopes that this has changed, as there is now integration between Razor and traditional MVC and Razor Pages.\n\nMy library allows you to create Tag Helpers that behave like Blazor Static SSR components, however, Blazor templating is still superior, allowing things like more consistent slots with compiler support with RenderFragments, and even a generics enhanced version of the RenderFragment that allows a lot of flexibility and compiler support when writing server UI components.\n\nI don't know what the future plans for the traditional CSHTML Razor are, so my feature request might not make sense, but if it will continue to exist, having the ability for the templating language to use generics with Tag Helpers would allow for added flexibility.\n\nOtherwise, I have a question, are there plans in the future to allow MVC and Razor Pages to use RAZOR files? \n\nMy preferred approach to writing applications is using MVC/Razor Pages with my library (for UI encapsulation) and AlpineJS and HTMX for client side interactions, and this approach is growing in popularity. Having a more powerful templated language for Static SSR type workloads would be awesome, regardless if it's the classic CSHTML we all know and love, or if a Static SSR version of RAZOR became an option to use by default in MVC/Razor Pages.\n\nI'd like to see integration become more flexible in the future if possible, and I'd like to help as well if I am able to.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe ability to use generic properties in tag helpers in MVC and Razor Pages in order to allow a usage similar to what a generic RenderFragment<T> allows you to do in Blazor.\n\nMaking Static SSR-like components in MVC is already proven to be possible and even relatively easy to implement, as my library proves, so my idea here is the compile time support for generics in cshtml, which would provide the right building blocks to expand my library's capabilities as well higher expression in the cshtml template language as a whole.\n\n### Additional context\n\nOnce again, my library for reference as well as Acmion's library which is similar to mine:\n\nhttps://razor-components.techgems.net/\nhttps://github.com/Acmion/CshtmlComponent","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65281","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[MVC and Razor Pages] RenderFragment-like generics support (as what is available in Blazor) in traditional MVC and Razor Pages\" (#65281)"},{"Id":"3876864455","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-31T00:30:07","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"65279","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable parallel restore for WindowsHostingBundle","State":"closed","Body":"Should mitigate https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/issues/4558","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/65279","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Disable parallel restore for WindowsHostingBundle\" (#65279)"},{"Id":"3877089304","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-30T19:36:33","Actor":"marty-shields","Number":"65280","RawContent":null,"Title":"Question about OpenAPI and nullable value types","State":"open","Body":"Hi there I was wondering if I could get some guidance on how I would best get around a situation I can't seem to find an answer to.\n\nI have the following property which allows we to ensure the user provides a value and that it is between the range:\n```\n[Required, Range(0, int.MaxValue)]\n    public int?

(FallbackPolicy, DefaultPolicy)","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI suspect that the `AuthorizeRouteView` relies solely on the `AuthorizeAttribute` and does not consider policies defined in the `AuthorizationOptions`.\nIf that's actually the case, it would mean that behavior configured through `AddAuthorization` is ignored, and the authorize router would not fire the expected `NotAuthorized` page.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `AuthorizeRouteView` should utilize the `AuthorizationOptions.FallbackPolicy` from the DI container to determine the availability of a page without the `AuthorizeAttribute`.\n\nWithout having looked into the `AuthorizeView`, I'd assume that it would also benefit from a default initialization based on the configured `AuthorizationOptions`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nHere is a minimalistic project that visualizes the actual issue:\n[BlazorAuthorizationOptions](https://github.com/Canabale/BlazorAuthorizationOptions) \n\n1. Pull\n2. Compile & Run\n3. Navigate through the pages & play around with the provided user dummies.\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.102\n\n### Anything else?\n\n1. Bug or Feature Request?\nI am not quite sure, if this is really a bug or a feature request. \nFor me it was unexpected that the `AuthorizationOptions` didn't implicitly apply to the `AuthorizeRouteView`, which is why *(unexpected behavior)* I openend it as a bug.\n\n2. There is another somewhat similar github issue:\n[Add a DefaultPolicy property on AuthorizeRouteView to be used when no Policies are set on a component](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/50111)\nIf the AuthorizationOptions would be correctly utilized by the components, I'd assume that this issue would resolve itself. \nIf I understood it correctly, it technically requests the `FallbackPolicy` feature as a parameter.\n\n3. Surprisingly, the `AuthorizeRouteView` seems to handle the `DefaultPolicy` correctly already. However it would be better if someone else could double check that. My current state of confusion makes me a little unsure if I am just seeing things. \n\n4. I'm aware that authentication and authorization behave differently in Blazor apps. \nEven @javiercn opened an [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/39932) because the current behavior is confusing.\nAnd to be honest... I'm one of the confused ones.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65277","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] AuthorizeRouteView does not take AuthorizationOptions into account.

Please describe the problem.\n\n**Describe the problem**\nIn a Blazor Server app with cookie-based authentication (e.g., ASP.NET Core Identity), the HTTP auth cookie is shared across browser tabs. When the user logs out and logs in as a different user in one tab, the cookie is updated accordingly. However, existing SignalR circuits in other tabs **can reconnect silently using the updated cookie**, leading to the circuit executing under a new identity **without any user interaction, notification, or explicit check**.\n\nThis can occur during normal SignalR reconnection scenarios (e.g., network hiccups, transient disconnects), where the client attempts to reconnect and the server rebinds the circuit using the current cookie principal. The framework does not enforce an invariant that the identity at reconnect matches the identity at circuit creation. As a result, a previously authenticated tab can suddenly start executing under a different authenticated principal, which can lead to **cross-user contamination, security boundary violations, and unsafe user state**.\n\n**Why this is an issue**\n- Blazor Server circuits are stateful and assume continuity of user context.\n- Shared authentication cookies (standard browser behavior) mean multiple tabs can influence the same session.\n- Silent reconnect (SignalR automatic reconnect) does not provide a hook or safety check to detect identity changes.\n- There is currently no built-in mechanism to detect or reject a reconnect when the authenticated user principal has changed.\n\nExisting issues have discussed cookie changes and reconnection behavior (e.g., auth state not reacting to cookie changes) but do not explicitly address detection or prevention of identity changes on reconnect (see related issues like #50858 which focuses on auth state hydration, not SignalR identity invariants).\n\n**Expected behavior**\nFramework support (opt-in or default) for one or more of the following:\n1. Hard fail on circuit reconnect if the authenticated principal has changed since circuit creation.\n2. A reconnect identity change event/callback so apps can observe and handle it.\n3. A configurable policy (e.g., `CircuitIdentityPolicy.RequireStablePrincipalOnReconnect`) that enforces user identity stability.\n4. Clear documentation/stabilization of behavior when authentication cookies change during an active Blazor Server session.\n\n**Impact**\nWithout such checks, apps - especially enterprise apps - must implement ad-hoc workarounds (e.g., capturing a stable user key and validating it on every component/service invocation), which is error-prone and not centrally enforced.\n\n**Steps to reproduce (conceptual)**\n1. Blazor Server app with cookie authentication (ASP.NET Core Identity).\n2. Open Tab A, authenticate as UserA.\n3. Open Tab B, authenticate as UserB.\n4. Cause a transient disconnect (e.g., blocking network momentarily).\n5. Allow automatic reconnect to occur in Tab A’s circuit.\n6. Observe that Tab A’s circuit now runs under UserB silently, with no UI update.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGuarantee identity continuity for a Blazor Server circuit. If a circuit was created under UserA, it must never continue executing under UserB after a reconnect unless the app explicitly allows it.\n\nWhen a Blazor Server circuit is established:\n1. Snapshot a stable user identifier from the initial `HttpContext.User`, e.g.: `ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier`\n2. On any reconnect / rebind, compare the current `HttpContext.User` stable id to the circuit’s snapshot.\n3. If it differs:\n   - reject the reconnect (do not attach to the existing circuit), and\n   - terminate the circuit (or force a hard reload / re-auth).\n\nThis prevents cross-user contamination _by construction_.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/65272","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor Server: Detect and prevent silent user identity changes on SignalR circuit reconnect\" (#65272)"},{"Id":"3874964889","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-30T10:03:01","Actor":"EmilyFeng97","Number":"65271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Some errors \"Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)\" appear in the browser console panel when updating the Counter file of 11.0 Blazor Web for WASM App and then run without build","State":"open","Body":"**REGRESSION INFO**  Works well on 10.0 and previous build 11.0.100-preview.1.26071.101\n\n**INSTALL STEPS**\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Use HostBuilder or WebApplicationBuilder instead. For more information, visit https://aka.ms/aspnet/deprecate/008.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [x] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nWe recommend the use of `HostBuilder` and `WebApplication` going forward over `WebHostBuilder` because they have all the features of `WebHostBuilder` and will be the focus of future investment.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nSee https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host or https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/webapplication for more details on the different hosting models.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy. Or authentication to fail if using TLS termination and expecting an https request.\n\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe change was made for security hardening, as the proxy and IP lists weren't being applied in all cases.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n- **Review your deployment topology:**  \n  Ensure that all legitimate proxy servers in front of your app are properly added to `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` in your `ForwardedHeadersOptions` configuration.\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownProxies = { IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_PROXY_IP\") }\n  });\n  ```\n  Or, for a network:\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownNetworks = { new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_NETWORK_IP\"), PREFIX_LENGTH) }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **If you wish to enable previous behavior:**  \n  You may need to relax your configuration, but this is **not recommended** due to security risks. You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

This could mean using custom [WebApplicationOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.webapplicationoptions?view=aspnetcore-7.0) which overrides all default hosting configuration sources.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/498","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: `WebApplicationBuilder` gives `ASPNET_`-prefixed environment variables lower precedence\" (#498)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2026-02-01T03:30:08.9491485Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3474}

Currently, this is handled on the client side by displaying a \"reconnection failed\" UI which requires the user to manually reload the page. Previously, in .NET 9 the page would reload automatically once the server has restarted.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Re-adds the default reloading behavior to:\r\n    - the `ReconnectModal` component used in the Blazor project template\r\n    - the `DefaultReconnectDisplay` implementation used in the framework as the fallback when no reconnection UI is found in the user code\r\n- Modifies the `ComponentHub` on the server to not send a client error when `ResumeCircuit` fails because of unavailable circuit state.\r\n    - This error caused the \"yellow bar\" to appear in the application. The error could not be caught by the client-side reconnection logic as it was processed elsewhere by the hubs's handler (for the \"JS.Error\" message).\r\n    - The PR changes `ComponentHub.ResumeCircuit` to only return a falsy result in the case of unavailable state (similarly to how `ConnectCircuit` indicates rejection), allowing the client-side reconnection logic to react to the rejection by the server properly.\r\n- Updates the behavior in `DefaultReconnectionHandler.attemptPeriodicReconnection` so that the display does not switch between \"reconnect\" and \"pause\" states.\r\n    - This created a bad user experience because the information displayed in the reconnection modal would flicker between the two variants which can be confusing both visually and message-wise.\r\n    - The PR change keeps the same logic for reconnection attempts (try to reconnect, then try to resume) but keeps the UI in the \"reconnect\" state.\r\n    - Reasoning: The fact that automatic reconnection can now involve resuming circuit with state stored on the server is an internal technical detail of the overall workflow that should not be surfaced to users, especially when this would be displayed only for few seconds before the page reload happens.\r\n- In one case the PR replaces reloading the page with just displaying a message: In the resume action that is invoked by the Resume button in the `ReconnectionModal` template. Now the page is reloaded only after server rejection, while normal failure (e.g. network issue) does not reload the page. This brings parity with the default UI.\r\n    - Reasoning: We don't want to do automatic reload after failed resume from a graceful pause.\r\n- Adds E2E tests that check reconnection behavior without server state.\r\n    - These emulate the situation when the server restarted and has lost state for the client's circuit.\r\n\r\nFixes #64228","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64732","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Improve Blazor reconnection experience after the server is restarted\" (#64732)"},{"Id":"3716393367","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-11T19:44:12","Actor":"oroztocil","Number":"64727","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0] Improve Blazor reconnection experience after the server is restarted","State":"closed","Body":"Backport of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64732 to release/10.0\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64228\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn .NET 10, resuming a Blazor circuit fails when the server has been restarted (and an out-of-process persistent storage is not used).

However, if the value in the ModelState cannot be parsed as a boolean, then ASP.NET Core throws a FormatException.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt is surprising that this can cause a FormatException to be thrown, since invalid user input is expected to be discarded when the model is initially bound. I would expect that if the input cannot be parsed, the checkbox is not set. If this is expected behaviour, guidance from the .NET team as to how a developer should handle this would be welcome.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRepo: https://github.com/waiwaing/aspnet-checkbox-exception\n\n1.

User is on Page 10 of 10 (100 items).\r\n2.  Filter reduces items to 5.\r\n3.  `SetTotalItemCountAsync(5)` detects invalid page -> calls `SetCurrentPageIndexAsync(0)`.\r\n4.  `SetCurrentPageIndexAsync` triggers a data refresh, calling `SetTotalItemCountAsync(5)` again.\r\n5.  The second call sees `TotalItemCount` is already 5, so it exits early without raising the event.\r\n6.  Result: UI stays on \"Page 10\" (phantom state).\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nAdded a `_hasPendingTotalItemCountChangedEvent` flag.\r\n*   When a page reset is required, we set the flag.\r\n*   The subsequent recursive call checks this flag and raises the event even if the count hasn't changed.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nSpecial thanks to @htmlsplash for identifying the root cause and proposing the solution in the issue discussion.\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\nAdded PaginationTests suite with regression test for the bug where TotalItemCountChanged fails to fire after page reset when the subsequent re-query returns the same total count.

Create a new Blazor WebAssembly app (no hosting .NET 8):\n```bash\ndotnet new blazorwasm -n DevCertRepro\n```\nOr create new project through UI.\n\n2. Open the generated .csproj and change:\n```xml\n<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n```\n\nto:\n```xml\n<TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>\n```\n\n3. Do not update any NuGet packages yet.\n\n4. Ensure a dev cert exists:\n```bash\ndotnet dev-certs https --clean\ndotnet dev-certs https --trust\ndotnet dev-certs https --check\n```\n\nOutput: valid CN=localhost dev cert (IsHttpsDevelopmentCertificate: true).\n\n5. Run the project with the default Development profile:\n```bash\ndotnet run --project DevCertRepro/DevCertRepro.csproj --launch-profile Development\n```\n\n✅ Result: dev server starts, HTTPS endpoint is configured correctly, app runs on https://localhost:<port>.\n\n6. Now update NuGet packages (either via IDE or CLI). For example:\n```\ndotnet list DevCertRepro/DevCertRepro.csproj package --outdated\n# Then update, either with `dotnet add package` or \"Update all\" in the IDE\n```\n\nBefore upgrade, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer version was:\n```xml\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer\" Version=\"8.0.15\" PrivateAssets=\"all\"/>\n```\n\nAfter upgrade, it becomes:\n```xml\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer\" Version=\"10.0.1\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />\n```\n\n7. Run again with the same command:\n```bash\ndotnet run --project DevCertRepro/DevCertRepro.csproj --launch-profile Development\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Unable to configure HTTPS endpoint.

The webapp project includes common as a dependency which includes any of its assets under /_content/common/etc...\n\nThere are also some assets that are duplicated in the main webapp's wwwroot directory because they were used outside of the common project's views. (this duplication happened due to refactoring over time)\n\nPrior to upgrading .netcore yesterday this setup ran without issue. Now the same builds fail with \"Conflicting assets with the same target path\" which it should not do because the common project (should produce) outputs to its own location.\n\nAfter investigating, that no longer seems to be the case.\nInstead of `/_content/common/font/Calibri.ttf`  I'm finding the contents provided by the common project are being sent to `/font/Calibri.ttf` (along with everything else form its wwwroot directory.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nRegardless of if they have the same relative path and name, the combined output should be:\n\n```\n/font/Calibri.ttf\n/_content/common/font/Calibri.ttf\n```\n\nThere shouldn't be a conflict here.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nExample Webapp csproj:\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\n\n  <PropertyGroup Label=\"Configuration\" Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'\">\n    <TypeScriptTarget>ES2021</TypeScriptTarget>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <PropertyGroup Label=\"Configuration\" Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'\">\n    <TypeScriptTarget>ES2021</TypeScriptTarget>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp8.0</TargetFramework>\n    <RootNamespace>unison_webapp</RootNamespace>\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n    <SignAssembly>False</SignAssembly>\n    <GenerateAssemblyInfo>False</GenerateAssemblyInfo>\n    <StartupObject>webapp.Program</StartupObject>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n\t  <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\common\\common.csproj\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n\t<None Include=\"wwwroot\\**\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\nExample Common csproj:\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\n    <PropertyGroup>\n        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n        <RootNamespace>common</RootNamespace>\n        <SolutionDir Condition=\"$(SolutionDir) == '' Or $(SolutionDir) == '*Undefined*'\">..\\webapp\\</SolutionDir>\n        <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n        <SignAssembly>False</SignAssembly>\n        <OutputType>Library</OutputType>\n        <ImportWindowsDesktopTargets>false</ImportWindowsDesktopTargets>\n    </PropertyGroup>\n\n    <ItemGroup>\n        <Compile Remove=\"packages\\**\" />\n        <EmbeddedResource Remove=\"packages\\**\" />\n        <None Remove=\"packages\\**\" />\n        <Content Remove=\"packages.config\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n\n    <ItemGroup>\n\t\t<None Include=\"wwwroot\\**\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n\n```\n\nIntended folder structure is:\n```\n[solution directory]\n   /webapp\n       /webapp\n           /wwwroot\n               /font\n                   /testfile.txt\n   /common\n      /common\n         /wwwroot\n             /font\n                 /testfile.txt\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\nRider version:\n```\nJetBrains Rider 2025.3.0.3\nBuild #RD-253.28294.237, built on November 26, 2025\nSource revision: 45206b7806fea\n```\n\nThe output of `dotnet --info`:\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100\n Commit:            b0f34d51fc\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.4c0ca8ba\n MSBuild version:   18.0.2+b0f34d51f\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     manjaro\n OS Version:  \n OS Platform: Linux\n RID:         linux-x64\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/10.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\nNo workload sets are installed.

In these default cases, the `NavigateTo` API works correctly.\n\nHowever there's also an obscure way to disable both of these via config. It's niche, but it's supported, so the rest of the system should work with that. Unfortunately `NavigateTo` assumes that either enhanced nav or an interactive router will be enabled and doesn't account for the case when neither is.\n\nFixes #51636\n\n## Customer Impact\n\nWithout this fix, anyone who uses the `ssr: { disableDomPreservation: true }` config option will be unable to use the `NavigateTo` API, as it will do nothing. This behavior isn't desirable.\n\n## Regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\nNo because existing code can't use `ssr: { disableDomPreservation: true }` as the option didn't exist prior to .NET 8.\n\nSomeone else might argue that it's a regression in the sense that, if you're migrating existing code to use newer .NET 8 patterns (and are using `disableDomPreservation` for some reason, even though you wouldn't normally), your existing uses of `NavigateTo` could stop working. That's not how we normally define \"regression\" but I'm trying to give the fullest explanation.\n\n## Risk\n\n- [ ] High\n- [ ] Medium\n- [x] Low\n\nThe fix explicitly retains the old code path if you're coming from .NET 7 or earlier (i.e., if you are using `blazor.webassembly/server/webview.js`.

This causes generated OpenAPI documents to contain `https://example.com/` instead of `https://example.com`, diverging from OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification examples.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Modified `GetOpenApiServers()` to strip trailing slash when `pathBase.HasValue` is false\n- Preserves trailing slash when `pathBase` explicitly contains \"/\" to maintain intentional path structure\n- Updated test expectations and snapshot tests to reflect correct behavior\n\n**Before:**\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": [\n    { \"url\": \"https://example.com/\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": [\n    { \"url\": \"https://example.com\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>[OpenAPI] Trailing slash in servers.url when generating OpenAPI spec</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Is there an existing issue for this?\n> \n> - [x] I have searched the existing issues\n> \n> ### Describe the bug\n> \n> When generating an OpenAPI document in ASP.NET Core, the servers section ends up with a URL that includes a trailing /. This comes from `GetOpenApiServers` method, which relies on `UriHelper.BuildAbsolute()`. That helper always appends a trailing slash.\n> \n> According to the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification (section 4.8.5.2), the server URLs in the examples is shown without a trailing slash. Because of the current behavior, the generated document doesn’t align with the expected format.\n> \n> The issue shows up immediately after adding `AddOpenApi()` with no extra configuration: the generated document contains https://example.com/ instead of https://example.com\n> \n> ### Expected Behavior\n> \n> `servers.url` should be generated without a trailing slash, matching the example from the specification.\n> \n> ### Steps To Reproduce\n> \n> Steps:\n> 1.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?   I am following the code here even though we have normal MVC and not razor pages like you have in the example.  I am still just calling \r\n\r\n>var signInUserResult = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(userName, password, rememberMe, true);\r\n\r\nNote: I am using Asp .net Identity in Identity server 4 application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/2079","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remember me isPersistent understanding\" (#2079)"},{"Id":"383297898","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-21T22:08:40","Actor":"mmillican","Number":"2080","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace a Role Validator","State":"closed","Body":"I am trying to create a custom role validator to support pseudo-multi-tenancy (which I know is not _officially_ supported in Identity) and am running into some issues.\r\n\r\nI've verified that my validator does work and is being called.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For more information, visit https://aka.ms/aspnet/deprecate/004.\n\nUsing `IWebHost` or `WebHost` will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID **ASPDEPR008**:\n> warning ASPDEPR008: WebHost is obsolete. Use HostBuilder or WebApplicationBuilder instead.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

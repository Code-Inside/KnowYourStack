This causes the attribute descriptions to be ignored when there's a valid type compatibility relationship between the attribute type and the inferred return type.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ProducesResponseType<IEnumerable<string>>(200, Description = \"List of items\")]\r\n() => TypedResults.Ok(new List<string>())\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the description \"List of items\" is lost because `IEnumerable<string> != List<string>`, even though `List<string>` implements `IEnumerable<string>`.\r\n\r\nWe can fix this by doing a better check:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Before: Only exact type matches\r\nif (responseType.Type == attributeType)\r\n\r\n// After: Allow inheritance/interface compatibility  \r\nif (responseType.Type == attributeType || \r\n    attributeType.IsAssignableFrom(responseType.Type) || \r\n    responseType.Type.IsAssignableFrom(attributeType))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis supports the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n- Interface implementations (IEnumerable<T> ↔ List<T>)\r\n- Inheritance relationships (BaseClass ↔ DerivedClass)\r\n- Collection type hierarchies (IReadOnlyList<T> ↔ ReadOnlyCollection<T>)\r\n\r\nWhile this works, there are some possible downsides to this approach, and more complex type differences between the attribute type and inferred type aren't handled by this code. See the PR comments for more information and discussions.\r\n\r\nFixes #60518\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62695","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix ProducesResponseType's Description not being set for Minimal API's when attribute and inferred types aren't an exact match\" (#62695)"},{"Id":"3224573793","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T21:40:26","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"62691","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unify handling of documentation IDs in OpenAPI XML comment generator","State":"closed","Body":"Following an investigation on the issue reported at https://github.com/captainsafia/aspnet-openapi-xml/issues/5 and the proposed solution at https://github.com/captainsafia/aspnet-openapi-xml/issues/5#issuecomment-3064392424 this is a prompt to resolve this issue in our current implementation.\n\n### Summary\n\n`XmlCommentGenerator.Parser` currently produces different documentation-comment IDs for some symbols than the IDs contained in XML files that come from referenced projects or NuGet packages. Because the keys don’t match, valid comments are silently dropped and never reach the `XmlCommentCache` that the generator emits.\n\n### Current behavior\n\n1. In-memory ID generation\n\n```csharp\n// src/OpenApi/gen/XmlCommentGenerator.Parser.cs\nif (DocumentationCommentId.CreateDeclarationId(method) is string name)\n{\n    comments.Add((name, xml));\n}\n```\n\nWhen the method symbol comes from the current compilation, Roslyn’s\n`CreateDeclarationId` returns an ID that can include the return type, e.g.\n\n```\nM:Api.ProjectBoardApis.DeleteProjectBoard(System.Int32)~System.Threading.Tasks.Task\n```\n\n2.\tXML file IDs\n\nThe same member in a referenced XML file is emitted by the C# compiler\nwithout the return-type suffix:\n\n```\n<member name=\"M:Api.ProjectBoardApis.DeleteProjectBoard(System.Int32)\">\n```\n\n3. Merge step\n\n```\nif (DocumentationCommentId.GetFirstSymbolForDeclarationId(name, compilation) is ISymbol symbol)\n{\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nWhen `name` is missing the `~returnType` suffix the lookup fails, so the\ncomment is discarded. The generated cache therefore contains entries for the in-memory ID only.\nDown-stream tooling that expects the compiler-style ID (the one in the XML\nfile) can no longer resolve the comment.\n\n### Desired behaviour\n\nBoth the IDs we emit and the IDs we use to query should match. `DocumentationCommentId.GetFirstSymbolForDeclarationId` should be in the\ncanonical compiler format (the same text that appears in the <member>\nelement of an XML doc file).\n\n### Proposed fix\n\n| Area                      | Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Parser – collection phase | Before calling `comments.Add((name, xml))` normalise `name` with a new helper `NormalizeDocId(string)` that strips the `~ReturnType` suffix for ordinary methods (retain it for `op_Implicit` / `op_Explicit`).                                            |\n| Parser – merge phase      | Apply the same `NormalizeDocId` to the key read from the XML file before the lookup.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Emitter                   | The `XmlCommentCache` keys are whatever the parser produces.

This mismatch caused valid XML comments to be silently dropped during the merge process.\n\n## Problem\n\n1. **In-memory compilation**: `DocumentationCommentId.CreateDeclarationId(method)` returns IDs with return type suffixes:\n   ```\n   M:Api.ProjectBoardApis.DeleteProjectBoard(System.Int32)~System.Threading.Tasks.Task\n   ```\n\n2. **XML files**: Referenced assemblies contain compiler-style IDs without return type suffixes:\n   ```xml\n   <member name=\"M:Api.ProjectBoardApis.DeleteProjectBoard(System.Int32)\">\n   ```\n\n3. **Merge failure**: `DocumentationCommentId.GetFirstSymbolForDeclarationId(name, compilation)` fails to find symbols when the key includes the return type suffix, causing comments to be discarded.\n\n## Solution\n\nImplemented a `NormalizeDocId` helper method that:\n- Strips return type suffixes (`~ReturnType`) from ordinary method documentation IDs\n- Preserves return type suffixes for conversion operators (`op_Implicit`/`op_Explicit`)\n- Normalizes both collection-phase and runtime lookup keys to the compiler-style format\n\n## Changes\n\n- **Parser**: Updated `ParseXmlFile` and `ParseCompilation` to normalize documentation IDs during collection\n- **Emitter**: Added `NormalizeDocId` method to generated code and updated transformers to use normalized lookup keys\n- **Tests**: Added comprehensive unit tests for normalization logic and integration tests for cross-assembly XML comment merging\n\n## Example\n\nBefore the fix, XML comments from referenced assemblies were ignored:\n```csharp\n// Referenced assembly XML: M:TestApi.Method(System.Int32)\n// In-memory lookup:        M:TestApi.Method(System.Int32)~System.Threading.Tasks.Task\n// Result: No match, comment dropped\n```\n\nAfter the fix, both are normalized to the same format:\n```csharp\n// Normalized cache key:    M:TestApi.Method(System.Int32)\n// Normalized lookup key:   M:TestApi.Method(System.Int32)  \n// Result: Match found, comment applied\n```\n\nAll existing tests pass, confirming the fix doesn't break any existing functionality while resolving the XML comment merge issue.\n\nFixes #62691.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

InputHidden","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\n\nCurrently, Blazor developers using SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and EditForm need to use raw HTML to create hidden input fields:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"model.Id\" @bind-value=\"model.Id\" />\n```\n\nThis approach is inconsistent with other Blazor input components that have dedicated wrappers (InputText, InputSelect, etc.). The lack of an InputHidden component creates an odd gap in the framework's form input components, making model binding more complex than necessary.\n\nAdding an InputHidden component will provide a consistent API surface for all form inputs and simplify model binding scenarios in Blazor applications.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms\n{\n+    public class InputHidden : InputBase<string?>\n+    {\n+        public ElementReference? Element { get; protected set; }\n+        protected override void BuildRenderTree(RenderTreeBuilder builder);\n+        protected override bool TryParseValueFromString(string? value, out string? result, out string? validationErrorMessage);\n+    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\n// Simple usage in an EditForm\n<EditForm Model=\"@model\" OnValidSubmit=\"@HandleSubmit\">\n    <InputHidden @bind-Value=\"model.Id\" />\n    <InputText @bind-Value=\"model.Name\" />\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</EditForm>\n\n// With additional attributes\n<EditForm Model=\"@model\">\n    <InputHidden id=\"user-id\" @bind-Value=\"model.UserId\" />\n    <InputHidden @bind-Value=\"model.SessionToken\" class=\"security-token\" />\n</EditForm>\n\n// Accessing the element reference\n@code {\n    private InputHidden hiddenInput;\n\n    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)\n    {\n        if (firstRender && hiddenInput.Element.HasValue)\n        {\n            // Can interact with the element if needed\n            var elementRef = hiddenInput.Element.Value;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nThe proposed design follows the established pattern of other input components in the framework, inheriting from `InputBase<T>` and providing a consistent API surface.\n\n## Risks\n\nN/A\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] API proposal for InputHidden\" (#62715)"},{"Id":"3229408227","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T16:59:20","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"62714","RawContent":null,"Title":"API proposal OwningComponentBase IAsyncDisposable implementation","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\n\nWhen we implemented `IAsyncDisposable` in components we should probably have also added support for this on `OwningComponentBase`. Previously, developers faced two main problems:\n\nWhen the injected service implements `IAsyncDisposable`, an exception is thrown: \"System.InvalidOperationException: 'MyService' type only implements IAsyncDisposable. Use DisposeAsync to dispose the container.\"\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\n{\n    public abstract class OwningComponentBase : ComponentBase, IDisposable, IAsyncDisposable\n    {\n        // ...existing members...\n        \n+       protected virtual ValueTask DisposeAsyncCore();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\n// Component with async disposable service\npublic class ChatComponent : OwningComponentBase<IChatService>\n{\n    // Service that implements IAsyncDisposable (e.g., has SignalR HubConnection)\n    private IChatService ChatService => Service;\n    \n    protected override async ValueTask DisposeAsyncCore()\n    {\n        // Custom async cleanup if needed\n        await base.DisposeAsyncCore();\n    }\n}\n\n// Component that implements IAsyncDisposable\npublic class MyAsyncComponent : OwningComponentBase, IAsyncDisposable\n{\n    // Component's own async resources\n    private SomeAsyncResource? _resource;\n    \n    protected override async ValueTask DisposeAsyncCore()\n    {\n        if (_resource != null)\n        {\n            await _resource.DisposeAsync();\n        }\n        \n        await base.DisposeAsyncCore();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nThe main alternative considered was to not implement this feature due to potential breaking changes. Adding `IAsyncDisposable` implementation with a `protected virtual DisposeAsyncCore()` method could clash with existing `IAsyncDisposable` implementations in subclasses, requiring developers to change their implementations to override the new base-class method.\n\n## Risks\n\n1. **Potential breaking changes**: Existing components that inherit from `OwningComponentBase` and implement `IAsyncDisposable` may need to update their implementation to override the new `DisposeAsyncCore()` method instead of implementing `IAsyncDisposable` directly.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62714","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"API proposal OwningComponentBase IAsyncDisposable implementation\"

parsing Websocket messages containing a 'headers' section. Parsing of headers is not currently implemented in `GsonHubProtocol.java`, which is [located here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/GsonHubProtocol.java)\n\nThe un-parseable payloads looks like this:\n```\n{\n  \"type\" : 1,\n  \"target\" : \"Command\",\n  \"headers\" : {\n    \"traceId\" : \"0HNE2SNHO754E:00000001\",\n    \"traceparent\" : \"00-e71ba9da7279d0683f29fc5054581a08-9518f7d2258253d7-01\"\n  },\n  \"arguments\" : [ {\n    \"Name\" : \"getpackage\",\n    \"Arg\" : \"\"\n  } ]\n}\n\n```\n\nSeems if the payload contains 'headers', the Java client will crash.\n\nThis appears to be server-side and not related to any changes we made to our codebase.\nMy guess is that Microsoft has decided to add these headers automatically for tracing/debugging purposes.\n\nWe really need a way to disable these tracing headers as we have no way to update all our client apps in production.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSignalR websocket messages should not include 'headers', or have a method for disabling 'headers'. The SignalR Java client should not crash when receiving a websocket messages containing 'headers'.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n.NET 9\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62713","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SignalR Java client failing on 'Headers not implemented yet.'\" (#62713)"},{"Id":"3229382428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T16:49:11","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"62712","RawContent":null,"Title":"API Proposal [Blazor] Support state persistence on root components #62331","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\n\nThis issue addresses the problem with state persistence on root components in Blazor applications. Currently, state persistence fails because the parent component during prerendering is different than the component in interactive mode, causing the loss of key information needed for proper state restoration across render modes.\n\nThe core issue is in the `GetSerializableKey` method in `SupplyParameterFromPersistentComponentStateValueProvider.cs` which produces different values when rendering statically versus when rendering interactively. This inconsistency prevents components from maintaining their state when transitioning between server-side rendering (SSR) and interactive modes (Server or WebAssembly).\n\nWithout this fix, developers cannot reliably use persistent component state on root components that cross render mode boundaries, limiting the effectiveness of Blazor's state persistence features in real-world applications.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Rendering;\n\npublic class ComponentState\n{\n+    protected internal virtual object? GetComponentKey();\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nThe new API is primarily used internally by the framework for state persistence, but it enables consistent behavior across render modes:\n\n```csharp\n// Root component with persistent state that works across render modes\n@page \"/counter\"\n@rendermode InteractiveAuto\n@key \"my-counter\"\n\n<h3>Counter</h3>\n<p>Current count: @count</p>\n<button @onclick=\"IncrementCount\">Increment</button>\n\n@code {\n    [SupplyParameterFromPersistentComponentState(\"count\")]\n    private int count;\n\n    private void IncrementCount() => count++;\n}\n```\n\n```csharp\n// Multiple root components with different keys maintain separate state\n<MyComponent @rendermode=\"InteractiveServer\" @key=\"1\" />\n<MyComponent @rendermode=\"InteractiveServer\" @key=\"2\" />\n```\n\nThe framework now ensures that the same component key is computed during both prerendering and interactive phases, enabling proper state persistence.\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nN/A\n\n## Risks\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62712","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"API Proposal [Blazor] Support state persistence on root components #62331\" (#62712)"},{"Id":"3229011785","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T14:41:17","Actor":"dariatiurina","Number":"62709","RawContent":null,"Title":"Changed css classes assignment in RenderPlaceholderRow","State":"open","Body":"# Changed css classes assignment in RenderPlaceholderRow\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes a change to the `QuickGrid.razor`.

MVC folder","State":"open","Body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR replaces all usages of `WebHostBuilder` with the modern `HostBuilder` and `ConfigureWebHost` pattern across the MVC folder, updating 24 files to follow current ASP.NET Core hosting best practices.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n**Pattern Transformation:**\n```csharp\n// Before\nvar host = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup<Startup>()\n    .UseKestrel()\n    .Build();\n\n// After  \nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup<Startup>()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\n```\n\n**Files Updated (24 total):**\n\n- **Samples (1):** MvcSandbox/Startup.cs\n- **Performance Benchmarks (3):** BasicApi, BasicViews, RazorRendering  \n- **Test Website Program.cs (7):** BasicWebSite, CorsWebSite, FormatterWebSite, RazorPagesWebSite, RazorWebSite, RoutingWebSite, SecurityWebSite, VersioningWebSite\n- **Test Website Startup.cs (13):** SimpleWebSite, FilesWebSite, ApiExplorerWebSite, ApplicationModelWebSite, ControllersFromServicesWebSite, ErrorPageMiddlewareWebSite, TagHelpersWebSite, XmlFormattersWebSite, HtmlGenerationWebSite (2 files), RazorBuildWebSite (2 files)\n\n## Key Changes Applied\n\n✅ **Added using statements:** `using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;`  \n✅ **Updated variable declarations:** `var host` → `using var host`  \n✅ **Renamed methods:** `CreateWebHostBuilder()` → `CreateHost()`  \n✅ **Changed return types:** `IWebHostBuilder` → `IHostBuilder`  \n✅ **Wrapped configuration:** `new WebHostBuilder()` → `new HostBuilder().ConfigureWebHost(...)`  \n✅ **Preserved all configurations:** All original `.UseKestrel()`, `.UseStartup<>()`, `.UseConfiguration()`, `.UseStaticWebAssets()`, etc. methods maintained  \n\n## Testing\n\n- All transformations follow the exact pattern specified in the requirements\n- Original functionality preserved - all configuration calls moved inside `ConfigureWebHost` lambda\n- Special configurations like `.UseStaticWebAssets()` in TagHelpersWebSite correctly handled\n- Complex configurations with local variables (like ConfigurationBuilder) properly maintained\n\n## Verification\n\n- ✅ 0 remaining `new WebHostBuilder()` usages in MVC folder\n- ✅ 24 files successfully transformed with `new HostBuilder()` pattern\n- ✅ All files compile with proper using statements and method signatures\n\n*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*\n> Remove all usages of WebHostBuilder in the MVC folder and replace them with HostBuilder and ConfigureWebHost. Specifically, for each occurrence of:\n> \n> Before:\n> var host = new WebHostBuilder()\n>     .Configure(app => {\n>         //...\n>     })\n>     .Build();\n> \n> Change to:\n> using var host = new HostBuilder()\n>     .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder => {\n>         webHostBuilder\n>             .Configure(app => {\n>                 //...\n>             });\n>     })\n>     .Build();\n> \n> Ensure all usages in the MVC folder follow this new pattern, updating variable declarations and method chains as needed.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

This is useful in cases where having a single file for production environments makes updates easier — including static content.\n\nNow we are moving to Blazor Server (using render mode InteractiveServer), but we're experiencing issues with isolated CSS, both in the main project and in the Razor libraries we use. The problem is that `<EmbeddedResource Include=\"wwwroot\\**\" />` includes files before the isolated CSS are built. We tried configuring custom `Target`s on the project, but none of them worked.\n\nIs there a way to embed the `wwwroot` folder including all the isolated CSS, so we can have a single-file deployment for production?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62696","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Cannot embed the wwwroot with isolated css folder\"

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy. Or authentication to fail if using TLS termination and expecting an https request.\n\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe change was made for security hardening, as the proxy and IP lists weren't being applied in all cases.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n- **Review your deployment topology:**  \n  Ensure that all legitimate proxy servers in front of your app are properly added to `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` in your `ForwardedHeadersOptions` configuration.\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownProxies = { IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_PROXY_IP\") }\n  });\n  ```\n  Or, for a network:\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownNetworks = { new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_NETWORK_IP\"), PREFIX_LENGTH) }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **If you wish to enable previous behavior:**  \n  You may need to relax your configuration, but this is **not recommended** due to security risks. You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nNote: In cloud environments, the proxy IP(s) can change over the lifetime of the app and `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` is sometimes used to make forwarded headers work.\n\n### References\n\n- [Forwarded Headers Middleware documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer)\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n`UseForwardedHeaders();`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/517","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Forwarded Headers Middleware Now Ignores X-Forwarded-* Headers from Unknown Proxies\" (#517)"},{"Id":"2662868601","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-15T18:59:39","Actor":"maraf","Number":"516","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nIn previous versions of Blazor WebAssembly, legacy Mono and Emscripten APIs were exported to global namespace. \r\nFrom 9.0 those APIs are accessible throught Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 9 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nLegacy Mono (MONO, BINDING) and Emscripten Module object was exported to global window object.\r\nFor example `window.Module.FS` returned emscripten virtual filesystem.\n\n### New behavior\n\nEmscripten Module object is now exported to `Blazor.runtime` object.\r\nFor example `Blazor.runtime.Module.FS` returns emscripten virtual filesystem.\r\nLegacy Mono API for interop was removed completely (MONO and BINDING) and replaced with JSImport/JSExport.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe general goal is not to polute global namespace and keep all the APIs accessible from single Blazor object.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nReplace accessing Emscripten APIs from window object to Blazor.runtime object.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nwindow.MONO.*\r\nwindow.BINDING.*\r\nwindow.Module.*","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/516","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Legacy Mono and Emscripten JavaScript APIs are not exported to global namespace in Blazor WebAssembly applications\" (#516)"},{"Id":"2606573022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-22T21:39:01","Actor":"amcasey","Number":"515","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: dev cert export no longer creates folder","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nWhen you export the ASP.NET Core development certificate (used to enable https in local development), it will no longer create the directory into which the certificate is being exported, if that directory doesn’t already exist.\r\n\r\nThis change first appears in 8.0.10 and 9.0 RC1.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 8 GA\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```\r\ndotnet dev-certs https -ep C:\\NonExistent\\cert.pfx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `C:\\NonExistent\\` did not exist when the command was run, it would be created (with permissions inherited from the containing directory).\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe target directory must exist or the export will fail with a message like `There was an error exporting the HTTPS developer certificate to a file.`\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe development certificate is exported with its private key, so unauthorized access can be very problematic.

For example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nendpoints.MapFallbackToFile(\"index.html\")\r\n    .WithMetadata(new HttpMethodMetadata(new[] { /* List supported methods here */ }));\r\n```\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nAll overloads of `StaticFilesEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapFallbackToFile()`.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/495","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Endpoints configured with 'MapFallbackToFile()' now only match 'HEAD' and 'GET' requests\" (#495)"},{"Id":"1376539134","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-16T22:09:33","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"494","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]:  Using the System.Text.Json source generator with ASP.

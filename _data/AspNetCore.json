outside of me manually throwing an OperationCancelledException","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf I create a default ASP.NET Core 8 Web API project in Visual Studio and add the Request Timeouts Middleware with a default policy of 10 seconds I don't get an HTTP504 even if I put a Thread.Sleep(30000) in the API endpoint to induce a timeout.\r\n\r\nLooking at [RequestTimeoutsMiddleware.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/32c9ec8d9c4b7f7f544cfb39dbf31f30a860d585/src/Http/Http/src/Timeouts/RequestTimeoutsMiddleware.cs#L96) it seems that the only scenario in which I'd get back an empty response and the defined HTTP error code is if my code manually throws an OperationCancelledException.\r\n\r\nI started a long-running API and then attached a debugger (to get past the `if (Debugger.IsAttached)\r\n{\r\n    return _next(context);\r\n}` at [line #31](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/32c9ec8d9c4b7f7f544cfb39dbf31f30a860d585/src/Http/Http/src/Timeouts/RequestTimeoutsMiddleware.cs#L31C1-L32C1) in RequestTimeoutsMiddleware.cs) and if I step backward from a breakpoint at the `finally{}` block I land at `await _next(context);` ([line #107](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/32c9ec8d9c4b7f7f544cfb39dbf31f30a860d585/src/Http/Http/src/Timeouts/RequestTimeoutsMiddleware.cs#L107C1-L108C1))...\r\n\r\nImportantly my `WriteTimeoutResponse` delegate specified in the timeout policy is never hit.\r\n\r\nIn other words it seems like the middleware may indeed cause a timeout but it doesn't set the HTTP result code when an induced timeout occurs.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like what would be required is to call `context.RequestAborted.Register()` within the try block at [line #101](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/32c9ec8d9c4b7f7f544cfb39dbf31f30a860d585/src/Http/Http/src/Timeouts/RequestTimeoutsMiddleware.cs#L101) and either move or duplicate the content of the `catch()when()` block to the delegate registered on the `linkedCts.Token` cancellaton token???\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf my operation exceeds the configured timeout then the configured HTTP status code should be set.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Timeouts;\r\n\r\nvar builder =

It is not 0 when TokenImpersonationLevel.Impersonation is used.\r\nGetImpersonationToken() seems to return a handle to a token of the user making the HTTP request.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nClient applications that use .NET Framework must not be changed in order for Windows Authentication to work.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n- We don't have this problem when we use [HTTP.sys web server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys?view=aspnetcore-8.0#configure-the-aspnet-core-app-to-use-httpsys)\r\n- As we have to use IIS, I developed a native IIS module (as a workaround) that sets the IHttpUser and forwards the calls of GetPrimartyToken() to GetImpersonationToken() for WCF calls.

I have a Blazor Component for editing a user and there after submitting this code is executed:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar user = await UserManager.FindByIdAsync(Id).ConfigureAwait(true);\r\nvar code = await UserManager.GenerateChangeEmailTokenAsync(user, newEmail).ConfigureAwait(true);\r\ncode = WebEncoders.Base64UrlEncode(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(code));\r\n```\r\nConfirmEmailChange.cshtml page has this code OnGetAsync:\r\n```csharp\r\ncode = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(WebEncoders.Base64UrlDecode(code));\r\nvar result = await this.userManager.ChangeEmailAsync(user, email, code);\r\n```\r\nAnd the result is not succeeded, and in result.Errors I get an error `InvalidToken`.\r\nI have added logging both raw code, encoded, received, and decoded. Raw and decoded codes are identical, and encoded and received codes are also identical. `+` are still `+`, they are not changed into spaces, all characters are identical. \r\nThis happens when the Application is running on a Linux Server. But when I run it locally on my Windows computer, the email changing works.\r\nHowever when I try to change my email in the Identity Email.cshtml page, with the following code:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar userId = await _userManager.GetUserIdAsync(user);\r\nvar code = await _userManager.GenerateChangeEmailTokenAsync(user, Input.NewEmail);\r\ncode = WebEncoders.Base64UrlEncode(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(code));\r\n```\r\nEverything works both on Linux and on Windows, it also directs to the ConfirmEmailChange.cshtml page.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\nwhy does the `userManager.ChangeEmailAsync` method work when receiving a:\r\n\r\n- windows razor page generated token\r\n- windows blazor component generated token\r\n- linux razor page generated token\r\n\r\nbut doesn't work on:\r\n\r\n- linux blazor component generated token\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n8.0.200\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54173","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"InvalidToken when confirming email change\" (#54173)"},{"Id":"2148924565","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-22T12:07:50","Actor":"gfoidl","Number":"54172","RawContent":null,"Title":"Request delegate generator produces CS8073 for ValueTask<T?> results","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nFor delegates that return `ValueTask<T?>? the compiler emits\r\n```\r\nWarning\tCS8073\tThe result of the expression is always 'false' since a value of type 'ValueTask<Person>' is never equal to 'null' of type 'ValueTask<Person>?'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is especially cumbersome when \r\n```xml\r\n<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>\r\n```\r\nis set.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo warning is produced.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```c#\r\nWebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nWebApplication app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\nPerson[] persons = [new Person(\"Batman\"), new Person(\"Me\")];\r\n\r\n// No problem\r\nPerson?

The main problems are not related to the refactoring of the code - they are related to the run-time behavior of Blazor and the fact that it is a \"black box\". \r\n\r\nMore specifically, I am referring to scenarios where Blazor refuses to render a component... where it executes component logic such as StateHasChanged() and then does nothing - ie. it does not refresh the UI, it does not throw an exception, and it does not log anything in the browser console. Many days can be spent trying to track down these types of issues and in the end there is no resolution because it is not possible to identify the root cause (because the problem is occurring deep within the Blazor framework itself and there is no developer feedback loop).\r\n\r\nExample # 1\r\n\r\nAn application which runs fine on global interactive rendering, attempts to run on static rendering. Within Visual Studio all of the logic is executing fine - no exceptions, no browser console messages - however the browser simply displays a blank page. If you view the source in the browser, you only see content from the App component - nothing else has been rendered. This resulted in 3-4 days of trying to identify the problem. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/4840590/aaceed0e-4ea0-4f66-9725-1cf4af0ff281)\r\n\r\nExample # 2\r\n\r\nA stattically rendered component which indicates that a variable contains content within Visual Studio and should be rendered in the UI, however the UI is never updated with the content. This provoked another 3-4 days of investigation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/4840590/b0a60f70-dc47-49ba-adab-23a94789a65a)\r\n\r\nIn both of these examples above (and a number of others) it turns out that there is a simple solution...\r\n\r\n```@attribute [StreamRendering]```\r\n\r\nIncluding this attribute within a component definition appears to be a \"magic pill\" to cure all sorts of strange, unexplainable rendering problems. Basically, rather than spending days trying to diagnose the Blazor \"black box\" I now sprinkle a component with some [StreamRendering] pixie dust, and it usually fixes the problem. From a developer productivity perspective alone, this attribute has already saved me from many days of spinning my wheels.\r\n\r\nFor Example # 1 including [StreamRendering] on the Routes component allowed the entire application to render as expected. For Example # 2 including [StreamRendering] on a custom Head component allowed page titles to be rendered as expected.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that most \"magic pills\" have side effects... they may solve the original problem but cause other issues in the process. In the case of [StreamRendering] there is very little documentation about what it is actually doing under the covers. Most of the information simply describes its purpose and benefits at a very high level. The fact that the Blazor Web template only includes it on the Weather component would seem to indicate that it should be used sparingly. So what are the implications from a performance, scalability, security perspective? Before I go ahead and sprinkle this attribute throughout my Blazor applications I would like to better understand the long term consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBetter guidance around the usage of [StreamRendering] in terms of when it should or should not be used, and the impacts of using it within an application.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n8.0\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54157","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET 8 Blazor - StreamRendering - Magic Pill or Major Headache?\" (#54157)"},{"Id":"2146397473","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-21T13:41:41","Actor":"alexvale242","Number":"54153","RawContent":null,"Title":"OnAfterRender not called on interactive component in loop","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nUsing the Blazor Web Template as a starting point. If you have a non-interactive component which creates a large number (more than 40) of InteractiveServer components in a for loop, the render lifecycle on the interactive child components breaks. \r\n\r\nThe OnAfterRender and OnAfterRenderAsync lifecycle methods do not fire and on page load we get the reconnection spinner. There's also two websocket connections, one which fails quickly and one which takes a while to get going. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/46447983/16b154b7-427d-4e3d-936b-5bd4ccf4dac8)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/46447983/1976ab9e-b04c-4434-82c9-0e4f1c261d44)\r\n\r\nIf the parent's render mode is InteractiveServer then this works as expected. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nRendering should work as intended and after render lifecycle methods should be called.

Please describe the problem.\n\nHello guys.\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can use the `GetUriWithQueyStringParameters` method to get an uri with querystring parameters that is populated with new values while keeping others which don't need to change. The only thing that I'd like to see improved is the way arrays are added to the querystring. Today, if you pass an array, you'll get an url in the form `?arr=option1&arr=option2...` which seems to be the most popular way to pass an array though querystring parameters. The problem with this approach is that many firewalls thed to consider this an attack ([Http Parameter Pollution](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/04-Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_Pollution)) even when the duplication happens at the queryparameter level.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nBesides this syntax, Web API apps have been able to handle querystring parameters with a slightly different syntax ( ex.: `?arr[0]=option1&arr[1]=options2...`) without any issues for years. Can this behavior be extended to the `GetUriWithQueryStringParameters`  method instead of using the current default approach?\r\n\r\nThanks.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT. These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

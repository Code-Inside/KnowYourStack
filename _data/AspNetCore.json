And while there is a workaround to implement the custom `EndpointDataSource` more correctly by ensuring the custom `GetChangeToken()` implementation doesn't return the old change token while cancelling it, ~this did not cause a stack overflow or really any other problem in .NET 6, so this is a regression~.\r\n\r\nFixes #44085\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\n`EndpointDataSource` is an advanced API, and defining a custom implementation that fires change tokens is rarer still. See https://grep.app/search?current=3&q=%3A%20EndpointDataSource for example usages.\r\n\r\nExamining grep.app shows a few custom implementations that do fire a token, but the ones I've seen so far do so correctly in a way that will not trigger a stack overflow.

Two components (A and B) use the same CSS class name\r\n2. B is a child component of A\r\n3. B is setting styles for child elements of that class\r\n\r\n...then the CSS from A is also applied to the child elements in B.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is truly a bug or just a limitation of CSS, but I didn't see anything in the [CSS Isolation docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation?view=aspnetcore-6.0) about this specifically. Although, the section at the top states:\r\n\r\n> Isolate CSS styles to individual pages, views, and components to reduce or avoid:\r\n> - Style conflicts in nested content.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess you could read that as \"reduce conflicts\" and not assume there will never be any. If it is indeed expected behavior, then a highlighted warning or something in the docs stating that it's not always _entirely_ isolated would be appreciated.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCSS is completely isolated to its own component/scope and has no conflicts with nested content.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create Blazor project (Server or WASM)\r\n2. Create two components with isolated CSS\r\n3. Add one component to the other component's DOM\r\n4. Add CSS class to container element of child component\r\n5. Add same CSS class to element in child component\r\n6. Add child element to element from step 5\r\n7.

If you add the scope attribute to all selectors it seems to fix the scopes. For example:\r\n````css\r\ndiv[b-ikhpxwtf7b] span[b-ikhpxwtf7b] {\r\n    text-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\n````\r\nHowever, I know this would prevent you from using a common CSS file unless you did something like [Customize scope identifier format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation?view=aspnetcore-6.0#customize-scope-identifier-format).

Please describe the problem.\n\nI made a silly mistake today that took me some time to debug because there appears to be no easy way to access the underlying messages sent by SignalR as plaintext.\r\n\r\nI have a method where I added a cancellationTokenSource as such.\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing (var cancelToken = new CancellationTokenSource(timeoutMS))\r\n{\r\n     return clientProxy.InvokeAsync<T>(methodName, request, cancelToken);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou might already be able to spot the problem (cancelToken should be cancelToken.Token) I had forgotten about this simple change I made and suddenly started getting the error:\r\n\r\n**Error reading JSON.\r\n'{' is invalid after a value. Expected either ',', '}', or ']'. LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 98.**\r\n\r\nI tried to enable detailed logging by adding trace for logging messages.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar conn = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n.ConfigureLogging(logging =>\r\n{\r\n    logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Trace);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet unfortunately I received no further details other than the message above.\r\n\r\nIn the end I needed to implement my own custom IHubProtocol by duplicating JsonHubProtocol which finally revealed the real error to me which was: \r\n\r\n`{\"type\":1,\"invocationId\":\"9\",\"target\":\"blahblah\",\"arguments\":[{blahblah}{\"type\":7,\"error\":\"Connection closed with an error. NotSupportedException: Serialization and deserialization of 'System.IntPtr' instances are not supported. Path: $.Token.WaitHandle.Handle.\",\"allowReconnect\":true}`\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI believe inside JsonHubProtocol -> ParseMessage on the error condition the entire message payload should be shown to the user or at least if tracing is turned on this should be the behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt should not be this difficult to find out what happened to cause deserialisation to fail.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIn summary, there should be more information when an error condition occurs deep inside the protocol.

The application itself navigates just fine. I just can't listen to the location changes in the blazor component.\r\n\r\nI should also note, that `CustomElements` seems to be working otherwise. The razor component `OnInitializedAsync` is invoked just fine.

Rewriting at once is not an option. You have an opportunity to do new development in ASP .NET Core, but users should not be disrupted. Therefore it is highly desirable for authentication to work seamlessly across the .NET Framework app and the ASP .NET Core app.  You maintain your own individual user accounts.\r\n\r\n[Documentation on sharing authentication cookies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cookie-sharing?view=aspnetcore-7.0) provides a starting point. Among other things you must use common string identifiers for:\r\n\r\n- Cookie Name\r\n- Authentication Scheme (formerly known as Authentication Type in .NET Framework)\r\n\r\nThe documentation suggest the magic string `\"Identity.Application\"` for the scheme without explaining why other strings won't work so easily.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be because the `services.AddDefaultIdentity()` extension sets the default Scheme to `\"Identity.Application\"` while setting up other useful defaults and services.  Without looking at the code to `AddDefaultIdentity` this is mysterious. \r\n\r\nThis leads to:\r\n\r\n- The consumer can easily name the cookie how they choose, but not the scheme\r\n- Attempts to use a different scheme name will frustrate & fail, unless the code to `AddDefaultIdentity` is reproduced\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\n\r\npublic static class IdentityServiceCollectionUIExtensions\r\n{\r\n+    public static IdentityBuilder AddDefaultIdentity<TUser>(this IServiceCollection services,\r\n+                                                            Action<IdentityOptions>? configureIdentityOptions,\r\n+                                                            Action<AuthenticationOptions>? configureAuthenticationOptions)\r\n+        where TUser : class\r\n+    {\r\n+        services\r\n+            .AddAuthentication(authenticationOptions =>\r\n+            {\r\n+                authenticationOptions.DefaultScheme = IdentityConstants.ApplicationScheme;\r\n+                authenticationOptions.DefaultSignInScheme = IdentityConstants.ExternalScheme;\r\n+                configureAuthenticationOptions?.Invoke(authenticationOptions);\r\n+            })\r\n+            .AddIdentityCookies(o => { });\r\n+        var identityBuilder = services\r\n+            .AddIdentityCore<TUser>(identityOptions =>\r\n+            {\r\n+                identityOptions.Stores.MaxLengthForKeys = 128;\r\n+                configureIdentityOptions?.Invoke(identityOptions);\r\n+            })\r\n+            .AddDefaultUI()\r\n+            .AddDefaultTokenProviders();\r\n+        return identityBuilder;\r\n+    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Configure Identity with Scheme and Cookie names shared with legacy application\r\nbuilder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(o => o.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true,\r\n                                                  o => o.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = MySharedConstants.AuthenticationScheme)\r\n                .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();\r\nbuilder.Services.ConfigureApplicationCookie(cookieAuthOptions => cookieAuthOptions.Cookie.Name = MySharedConstants.CookieName);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nA simpler design might be to just pass in the default scheme name, if that's the common scenario:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuilder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(o => o.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true, \r\n                                                  defaultAuthenticateScheme: MySharedConstants.AuthenticationScheme)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever it seems awkward to pass the name of the scheme after the options lambda. \r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nNone that I'm aware of.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44364","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`services.AddDefaultIdentity(configureIdentityOptions, configureAuthenticationOptions)`\" (#44364)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?   I am following the code here even though we have normal MVC and not razor pages like you have in the example.  I am still just calling \r\n\r\n>var signInUserResult = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(userName, password, rememberMe, true);\r\n\r\nNote: I am using Asp .net Identity in Identity server 4 application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/2079","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remember me isPersistent understanding\" (#2079)"},{"Id":"383297898","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-21T22:08:40","Actor":"mmillican","Number":"2080","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace a Role Validator","State":"closed","Body":"I am trying to create a custom role validator to support pseudo-multi-tenancy (which I know is not _officially_ supported in Identity) and am running into some issues.\r\n\r\nI've verified that my validator does work and is being called.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Starting in .NET 6, if a fallback file endpoint was configured, it could match routes that were discarded due to the request having a different content type than what was specified in an action's `ConsumesAttribute`. This was an undesirable change in behavior from .NET 5 that we are partially addressing in .NET 7 by making fallback file endpoints only match `GET` and `HEAD` requests.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7 RC2\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nEndpoints configured with `StaticFilesEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapFallbackToFile()` may match requests made with any request method.\n\n### New behavior\n\nEndpoints configured with `StaticFilesEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapFallbackToFile()` will only match `HEAD` and `GET` requests.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThis partially reverts larger breaking change accidentally introduced in .NET 6.

However, if you were using this binding, please make sure to review [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints) on how you can update your server to enable HTTPS.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nN/A","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/486","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Removed default HTTPS binding on Kestrel\" (#486)"},{"Id":"1240740970","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-18T23:44:43","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"485","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ActionResult<T> set StatusCode to 200","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWhen returning a `T` in a MVC/API Controller Action that declares the return type as `ActionResult<T>` will now always set the `ObjectResult.StatusCode` to `200`, unless when the `T` is a `ProblemDetails`.\r\n\r\nSince before this change the `ObjectResult.StatusCode` was `null`, in some scenarios where the status code is set manually, this change could cause unexpected behaviors. Also, an Action Filter could be affected by this change if it expects the `null` instead of `200`.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n.NET 6\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\nBefore if you have a Controller's Action that returns `T` and sets the `Response.StatusCode` manually, similar to the example:\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\n\r\n// Generates a 202 Accepted response\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n    Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n    return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt will generate the expected `202 Accepted` response status code.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nAfter the changes the same Controller's Action that returns `T` that sets the `Response.StatusCode` manually, will always generate a `200 OK` response.\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\n\r\n// Generates a 200 OK response\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n    Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n    return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis behavior is documented since ASP.NET Core 3.1 (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/action-return-types?view=aspnetcore-3.1#actionresultt-type), however, it keeps the `StatusCode` as `null` that will eventually generate a `200 OK` response as default. Since the default internal behavior could easily change, was decided to avoid relying on the internal default implementation and setting the `StatusCode` to the expected `200 OK`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you are broken by this change, as the example mentioned before:\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n    Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n    return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will need to change your Controller Action.

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change. Optionally, there are changes to your application that you may consider to work around this change if it impacts your application:\r\n\r\n* [`ActivatorUtilitiesConstructorAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilitiesconstructorattribute) can be applied to constructor to specify an exact constructor to use.\r\n* Application developers may register an implementation of `IComponentActivator` in the DI container that reverts to the .NET 6 behavior.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Affected APIs\n\nComponent constructors","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/482","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default\" (#482)"},{"Id":"1190169916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-01T19:03:58","Actor":"brunolins16","Number":"484","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Updated empty body detection in MVC Model Binding","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThe mechanism to detect an empty request `body` during the MVC Model Binding now uses the [`IHttpRequestBodyDetectionFeature.CanHaveBody`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.features.ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature.canhavebody?view=aspnetcore-6.0#microsoft-aspnetcore-http-features-ihttprequestbodydetectionfeature-canhavebody), that is currently implemented by the following behavior:\r\n\r\n- `true` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with a non-zero `Content-Length` or a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that did not set the `END_STREAM` flag on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\n- `false` when:\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with no `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header, or the `Content-Length` is `0`.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/1.x` request with `Connection: Upgrade` (e.g. WebSockets). There is no HTTP request body for these requests and no data should be received until after the upgrade.\r\n  - It's an `HTTP/2` request that set `END_STREAM` on the initial headers frame.\r\n\r\nSince the previous behavior was a simple validation of the `Content-Length == 0`, in some scenarios when requests are not sending all needed HTTP information, could now be detected as empty request and report a failure to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n7.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\n Before if you have a Controller's action that bind a parameter from body:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n [HttpPost()]\r\n        public IActionResult Required([FromBody] TestClass value) => Ok(value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the client request does not include a `Content-Length` header, eg.:\r\n\r\n``` curl\r\ncurl --request POST -k -i \"[action]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will cause an internal exception during the body deserialization:\r\n\r\nEg.: When using the `System.Text.Json` input formatter\r\n``` log\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonException: 'The input does not contain any JSON tokens. \r\nExpected the input to start with a valid JSON token, when isFinalBlock is true. \r\nPath: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 0.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a response payload similar to this will be receive by the client:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1\",\r\n  \"title\": \"One or more validation errors occurred.\",\r\n  \"status\": 400,\r\n  \"traceId\": \"00-34e98b5841b88bfb5476965efd9d9c8c-5bb16bc50dfbabb7-00\",\r\n  \"errors\": {\r\n    \"$\": [\r\n+      \"The input does not contain any JSON tokens.

This enables the following usage pattern to deal with issues like the request body conflicting with the renegotiation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (connection.ClientCertificate == null)\r\n{\r\n  await BufferRequestBodyAsync();\r\n  await connection.GetClientCertificateAsync();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplications that use delayed client certificate negotiation need to call GetClientCertificateAsync() to trigger that.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n [HttpSysOptions.ClientCertificateMethod](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.httpsys.httpsysoptions.clientcertificatemethod)\r\n  [HttpContext.Connection.ClientCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connectioninfo.clientcertificate)\r\n  [HttpContext.Connection.GetClientCertifiateAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connectioninfo.getclientcertificateasync)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/466","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ClientCertificate property no longer triggers renegotiation for HttpSys\" (#466)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1577343153841262592","CreatedAt":"2022-10-04T17:01:28+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgrKZI8 Community Standup - Securing https://t.co/eFOzgrKZI8 Core APIs https://t.co/4V6SQ7NN8s","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1577342961972436992","CreatedAt":"2022-10-04T17:00:42+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!\n\nhttps://t.co/LK2B1yFvvp https://t.co/UMHIJxISkn","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":8,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1577023290987532289","CreatedAt":"2022-10-03T19:50:26+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"On this week's #ASPNET Community Standup:\n🔐 Securing https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Core APIs\n🎙️ Damien Bowden, Jon Gallow… https://t.co/hJdrACzp0d","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":31,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1575621647368757248","CreatedAt":"2022-09-29T23:00:49+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"🏗️Migrating from https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 to https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Core (Part 4)\n\nhttps://t.co/OpFPff9jGu","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":34,"FavoriteCount":6,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1575621268144988160","CreatedAt":"2022-09-29T22:59:18+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"🧪Experimental WebTransport over HTTP/3 support in Kestrel\n\nhttps://t.co/PMeRnfqN8p","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":26,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1574563384606932993","CreatedAt":"2022-09-27T00:55:39+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"🤯Use .NET from any JavaScript app in .NET 7\n\nhttps://t.co/53gosCn5UO","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":135,"FavoriteCount":43,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1570115059594203142","CreatedAt":"2022-09-14T18:19:36+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Announcing Entity Framework 7 Release Candidate 1\n\nhttps://t.co/WRrb6TMOEQ","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":42,"FavoriteCount":17,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1570114729422761985","CreatedAt":"2022-09-14T18:18:17+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"#AspNetCore updates in .NET 7 RC 1\n\n✨Dynamic auth requests in Blazor WASM\n✨Blazor WASM debug improvements\n✨.NET Jav… https://t.co/Rxs05vnWsy","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":82,"FavoriteCount":36,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1569732777310064640","CreatedAt":"2022-09-13T17:00:32+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgrKZI8 Community Standup - Blazor in .NET 7 Part II https://t.co/hCrSaNIwAC","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":14,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1569732348866076672","CreatedAt":"2022-09-13T16:58:50+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

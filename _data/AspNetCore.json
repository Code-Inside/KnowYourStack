Whatever behaviors exist when .NET 8 ships will become something we're fairly committed to.\r\n\r\nBased on how sections are implemented (i.e., `SectionContent` passes a `RenderFragment` to a `SectionOutlet` in some other part of the component hierarchy), I would expect this to cause some unintuitive behaviors in the following features:\r\n\r\n * **Cascading parameters**: the section content looks as if it would inherit cascading parameters placed around the `<SectionContent>`, but it will actually get ones that are placed around the `<SectionOutlet>` (since the renderfragment is executed by the `SectionOutlet`)\r\n * **Error boundaries**: if there's an unhandled exception, you'd expect it to be caught by an `<ErrorBoundary>` placed around the `<SectionContent>`, but it will actually get caught by one placed around the `<SectionOutlet>` (same reason)\r\n * **Streaming rendering**: you'd expect the \"streaming-or-not\" flag to be determined by the component supplying the content for a `<SectionContent>`, but it will actually be determined by the component rendering the `<SectionOutlet>`\r\n\r\n### Underlying issue\r\n\r\nThe core issue is that each of those features walk up the chain of parent components in the hierarchy to determine how to behave. Since the `RenderFragment` is executed by the `SectionOutlet`, the components rendered there are descendants of the `SectionOutlet` not the `SectionContent` - even though in the app source code, it looks as if they are descendants of the `SectionContent`.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis is just a suggestion. I haven't actually implemented this to fully validate it.\r\n\r\n * Update `ComponentState` so that as well as tracking the `ParentComponentState`, it also has a `LogicalParentComponentState` property.\r\n   * By default this is always just set to the same value as `ParentComponentState`\r\n   * ... but for `SectionOutlet` in particular, it has a special behavior of being set to the component state for the current `SectionContent`. That is, whenever `SectionOutlet` switches to a new source for its renderfragment, it also changes its own `LogicalParentComponentState` to match.\r\n     * This is a magic built-in behavior of `SectionOutlet` provided by the framework, since sections are a special framework feature. No other component needs to be able to do this.\r\n * Change each of these features so that, when walking the list of parent components to find ancestors, they walk up the chain of `LogicalParentComponentState` values instead of `ParentComponentState`:\r\n   * Finding cascading value suppliers\r\n   * Finding error boundary suppliers\r\n   * Deciding whether or not to run in streaming rendering mode\r\n* Add E2E tests showing each of those features now behave in an intuitive way when used with sections\r\n* Remove [this line](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Components/Components/src/Sections/SectionOutlet.cs#L9) that previously worked around this. This will make streaming rendering within `SectionContent` vary according to the host component, instead of being hardcoded to on in all cases.\r\n\r\nWhen solving this issue, we should try to do so in a way that has zero perf impact for cases that aren't using sections. That's an aspect of the proposed solution above. So, for example, we should *not* have logic that runs on every component instantiation to check whether it's inside some `SectionContent` or similar.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47621","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ensure other features interact well with Sections\" (#47621)"},{"Id":"1660469837","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T08:56:42","Actor":"haludi","Number":"47620","RawContent":null,"Title":"Log on reset socket even if the logger is disabled","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf a SocketException exception is thrown while the `SocketConnectionListener` is accepting a new connection, the logger will still log, even if the logger is disabled\r\n\r\nNo `IsEnabled` check in the call position:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/release/7.0/src/Servers/Kestrel/Transport.Sockets/src/SocketConnectionListener.cs#L90\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/release/6.0/src/Servers/Kestrel/Transport.Sockets/src/SocketConnectionListener.cs#L90\r\n\r\nAnd explicitly skip the check on the code generation:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/release/7.0/src/Servers/Kestrel/Transport.Sockets/src/Internal/SocketsLog.cs#L50\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/release/6.0/src/Servers/Kestrel/Transport.Sockets/src/Internal/SocketsTrace.cs#L70\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is to call to `IsEnabled` at some point and not log if a call to it should return `false` \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nImplement `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger`\r\nImplement the `Log` method to only log without checking if should log (relay only on `IsEnabled`)\r\nDefine the system to use the custom logger.\r\nStart a socket connection and reset it while the server accepts it (I didn't find how to do that).the \n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0, 7.0\n\n### Anything else?\n\n# Some related PRs and issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/31562#issuecomment-814249748\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/31332\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/51927\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/50334","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47620","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Log on reset socket even if the logger is disabled\" (#47620)"},{"Id":"1660369735","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T07:23:39","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"47619","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use WaitHandle in Kestrel heartbeat to quickly exit thread on stop","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47600","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47619","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Use WaitHandle in Kestrel heartbeat to quickly exit thread on stop\" (#47619)"},{"Id":"1660279779","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T05:57:45","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"47618","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace internal Microsoft.Extensions.Metrics with package","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46834 adds an internal prototype version of Microsoft.Extensions.Metrics.

In case a background service crashes I get an event in the Event Viewer, but this has to be manually checked, or reported by users that something isn't running at all or use try finally to make the service report itself.\r\nIn case if there is permanent issue that has to be resolved manually, it may be better to leave the BackgroundService \"crashed\" / inactive and after the issue is fixed, having the whole service restarted in order to be updated by the \"patching\" service.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n1. The solution that I would love to see is to be able from other service or from other place (ex. in the Main() method) to check the status of the BackgroundService, ex. if it's running, starting, stopping, inactive. \r\n2. It may be great to be able to have another method within the service itself, that runs in parallel to the main thread / Task, and allows to be used like heartbeat that reports somewhere that the service is alive, and still use the Task.Delay() to configure how frequenlty to give a heartbeat. \r\n3. A control over the services like Something.Stop() / Start() / Pause() may be useful (ex. updating some app that the service depends on and pausing until it's done). \r\n4. Some straightforward way to collect \"diagnostic\" or other data from the main thread, like how much time took for the latest query to execute, like back-and-forth thingie between the hearbeat thread and main the thread.\n\n### Additional context\n\nCurrently I digged as much as I can and I didn't find absolutely anything that could help me with monitoring, controlling or at least getting the state of a BackgroundService (without using Azure Monitoring). Azure Monitoring and Application Insights it's a great service , but it's not free (1.94 EUR for log injection per GB) and if I want to actully use this data for something outside the Azure portal, I have to use the LogAnalytics API and kusto query language. If there is any other way except this one, I would be very happy to hear it.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47616","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Health Checking / Heartbeat for BackgroundService, IHostedService\" (#47616)"},{"Id":"1659599840","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-08T18:05:31","Actor":"msmaldi","Number":"47615","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove HardCoded string in Identity EF Tables Name","State":"open","Body":"Problem: If you are using a database like Postgres that uses snake_case instead of PascalCase, you will have problem with the names of the Identity tables, since the strings are HardCoded, the problem is solved removing ToTable and HasDatabaseName in files IdentityDbContext.cs and IdentityUserContext.cs\r\n\r\nWhen using EF we can switch to snake_base using project like https://github.com/efcore/EFCore.NamingConventions ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47615","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Remove HardCoded string in Identity EF Tables Name\" (#47615)"},{"Id":"1659583403","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-08T17:04:48","Actor":"nakigoe","Number":"47614","RawContent":null,"Title":"AMP-HTML","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nThe feature request is related to the limitations and problems encountered when uploading large files using Blazor WebAssembly and the InputFile component. Due to the constraints of the underlying browser implementation and the fetch API, uploading large files can lead to memory issues and permission errors.\r\n\r\nTo work around these limitations, developers often need to implement custom JavaScript solutions that handle chunking of the file during the upload process. This can be challenging and time-consuming, and it would be beneficial if the InputFile component could automatically handle chunking when uploading files.\r\n\r\nBy adding built-in support for chunking in the InputFile component, it would make it easier for developers to work with large files and improve the overall experience of handling file uploads in Blazor WebAssembly applications. This feature would also help to mitigate the limitations imposed by the current browser implementation and the fetch API, making file uploads more efficient and reliable.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like the Blazor InputFile component to automatically handle chunking of files during the upload process. The solution should seamlessly integrate with the existing component API. This enhancement would allow developers to upload large files without encountering memory limitations or permission issues caused by the browser or the fetch API.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAlthough some may initially view enabling chunking in the InputFile component as outside the scope, I believe that there are numerous benefits to doing so that make it a fitting addition. This is particularly relevant for Blazor developers, who typically value efficient and reliable development without having to rely on custom JavaScript solutions. I am fairly new to the Javascript side of things myself but I have been working on an upload as many of my sites require it. I have created a poc that was able to successfully bypass the limit. I would be happy to provide it if needed but because its not a modified version of the InputFile component I won't put it here initially.

That is, as each chunk is written by middleware, it should be sent in the HTTP response to the browser without waiting for the entire response to complete.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if CSS Hot Reload is enabled via this dialog:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/230638654-536fa948-f99d-402c-9858-ddae5e05f4f6.png)\r\n\r\n... then streaming rendering no longer works. It appears that the response is being buffered until complete and then is sent all at once to the browser. This prevents the feature from being observed and tested in development.\r\n\r\n### Maybe it's browserlink\r\n\r\nIf you have CSS Hot Reload enabled, this is hooked up to VS via browserlink. You can see this in the generated HTML, as it inserts:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Visual Studio Browser Link -->\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/_vs/browserLink\" async=\"async\" id=\"__browserLink_initializationData\" data-requestId=\"7d7d24491f0b43b0ae0d2f2e1d39369c\" data-requestMappingFromServer=\"false\" data-connectUrl=\"http://localhost:59817/95a89da6d84a410493c62463299a0058/browserLink\"></script>\r\n<!-- End Browser Link -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat markup is injected if and only if CSS Hot Reload is enabled. Perhaps the issue is with how this is achieved. If this is done by buffering the response so that something can search for `</body>` and insert it there, that would explain the whole problem.\r\n\r\n### It's not a problem with regular (non-CSS) hot reload\r\n\r\nNote that if you have regular (non-CSS) hot reload, then something auto-injects `<script src=\"/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js\"></script>`. This does **not** block response streaming. I have verified that streaming rendering works fine with this being injected, as long as CSS Hot Reload is disabled.\r\n\r\nHopefully whatever technique is used here to inject `aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js` could also be used for the `/_vs/browserLink` script to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47608","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Streaming rendering is blocked by CSS Hot Reload (possibly by browserlink)\" (#47608)"},{"Id":"1658787584","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-07T13:06:00","Actor":"SireMartin","Number":"47607","RawContent":null,"Title":"httpclient.PostAsJsonAsync ignores jsonpropertyname attr if it starts with an @ on serialization","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI got the impression that HttpClient.PostAsJsonAsync ignores JsonPropertyNameAttribute if it starts with an @ on serialization\r\nIf i use the JsonSerializer.Serialize(), the serialization seems OK\r\n\r\nExample using this object for serialization:\r\npublic class Agv\r\n{\r\n    [JsonPropertyName(\"@timestamp\")]\r\n    public DateTimeOffset Timestamp {get;set;}\r\n}\r\n\r\nUsing JsonSerializer.Serialize(agv), the object gets serialzed correct :\r\n\"{\\\"@timestamp\\\":\\\"2023-04-07T12:47:23.654374+00:00\\\"}\"\r\n\r\nUsing await _httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync($\"{iterMsg.PartitionKey}/_doc?{iterMsg.ReplyTo}\", agv);\r\nPipedream shows me te following output:\r\n\r\nTimestamp:\r\n2023-04-07T12:47:23.654374+00:00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nhttpclient should serialize the same way as JsonSerializer.Serialize()\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47607","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"httpclient.PostAsJsonAsync ignores jsonpropertyname attr if it starts with an @ on serialization\" (#47607)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"ben-foster-rightio","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

The .NET 7.0 rate limiting API includes a concurrency limiter along with several other rate limiting algorithms that you can apply to your application.\r\n\r\nFor more information on rate limiting in ASP.NET Core see:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/performance/rate-limit\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 8 (other)\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nDevelopers using the `ConcurrencyLimiterMiddleware` could control concurrency by adding a policy to DI and enabling the middleware:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddStackPolicy<options => {\r\n    options.MaxConcurrentRequests = 2;\r\n    options.RequestQueueLimit = 25;\r\n    });\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseConcurrencyLimiter();\r\n// Map endpoints.\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nHere is some example usage using the new API:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting;\r\nusing System.Threading.RateLimiting;\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.UseRateLimiter(new RateLimiterOptions()\r\n    .AddConcurrencyLimiter(\"only-one-at-a-time-stacked\", (options) =>\r\n    {\r\n        options.PermitLimit = 2;\r\n        options.QueueLimit = 25;\r\n        options.QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.NewestFirst;\r\n    }));\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", async () =>\r\n{\r\n    await Task.Delay(10000);\r\n    return \"Hello World\";\r\n}).RequireRateLimiting(\"only-one-at-a-time-stacked\");\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe older `ConcurrencyLimiterMiddleware` is infrequently used and undocumented.

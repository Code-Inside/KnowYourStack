The exceptions looked to be random, and were logged on pages that are incredibly simple and always worked perfectly when tested in a browser.\r\n\r\nEventually I tracked the errors down to when pages are requested with `HEAD` or `OPTIONS` HTTP verbs. The exceptions are thrown as the view is executed, because the page's `OnGet()` has not prepared the view model and it is in an uninitialised state.\r\n\r\nSome quick testing on an MVC project shows that things just seem to work as expected out of the box. If the action is decorated with any standard HTTP verbs (`[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`) then a `HEAD` or `OPTIONS` request returns a 404 status response, which makes good sense. If there are no HTTP verb attributes present then a `HEAD` or `OPTIONS` request returns an empty 200 status response, which again seems fine.\r\n\r\nIs there a suggested best practice for dealing with the above with Razor Pages?"},{"Id":"7381573803","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T23:33:19","Actor":"ajaybhargavb","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7480","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Enable RazorCompileOnBuild of test website\" (#7480) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"#2150\r\n\r\nThe latest build of Razor contains the TagHelper serialization fix which should fix this issue."},{"Id":"7381441599","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T22:53:27","Actor":"ryanbrandenburg","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7481","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Create or update baselines to match 2.0\" (#7481) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"7381413843","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T22:45:54","Actor":"ajaybhargavb","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7480","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Enable RazorCompileOnBuild of test website\" (#7480) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"#2150\r\n\r\nThe latest build of Razor contains the TagHelper serialization fix which should fix this issue."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Identity":{"Events":[{"Id":"7381472898","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T23:02:21","Actor":"Gengadook","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1682","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Allow specifying the default authorization scheme on a controller action without the authorize attribute\" (#1682) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"This would be useful in the situation where I have some api controllers hosted within an MVC app that already uses a default cookies authorization scheme.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where, if an application is hosted behind Internet Information Server (IIS) a remote unauthenticated attacker can use a specially crafted request can cause a Denial of Service.\r\n\r\n## Dicussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/IISIntegration/issues/658\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nAny site hosted behind a different proxy, such as nginx or an application hosted in Azure, which uses Application Request Routing (ARR) as a proxy is not affected. \r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft ASP.NET Core project if it is hosted behind an IIS server running AspNetCoreModule (ANCM) prior to 7.1.1990.0.\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected? \r\n\r\nOpen a PowerShell prompt and run the following command\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(Get-Item $env:SystemDrive\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\aspnetcore.dll).VersionInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\nor use the Windows file properties dialog to check the version on `C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\aspnetcore.dll`, where C: is your OS install drive.\r\n\r\nIf the file version is less than 7.1.1990.0 you are affected.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue? \r\nInstall the latest version of the ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle \r\n(You need only install a single version, i.e. installing Version 2.0 will protect Version 1.0/1.1 .NET Core applications and vice versa. Choose the one that corresponds to the highest runtime version on your server).\r\n\r\n* [Hosting Bundle for ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869677)\r\n* [Hosting Bundle for ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869674)\r\n\r\nThen restart IIS by running \r\n\r\n```\r\nnet stop was /y\r\nnet start w3svc\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom an elevated command line.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These images will continue to receive patch update whenever a 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x update ships, however, we will not produce a new version which contains the 2.1 runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n \r\nThese images existed to support CI/CD pipelines that run apps on multiple versions for .NET Core in the same container. With each release, these images have grown in size. The 1.0-2.0 image is already about 1GB, and would continue to grow with runtime updates. \r\n \r\nFortunately, recent improvements to .NET Core (such as minor version roll-forward) and Docker (multi-stage builds) have reduced the need to use an image with multiple versions of .NET Core. We have seen usage of these multi-version images declining over time, and today, they are a small percentage of our Docker image usage.\r\n\r\nRather than maintaining a single, large image with all possible .NET Core runtimes, we encourage users to use multi-stage builds. Docker's multi-stage feature allows you to compose a single Dockerfile, but still use multiple .NET Core runtimes. Also, starting in 2.1, .NET Core supports rolling forward the runtime version within the major version, which will further reduce the need to have multiple 2.x runtimes side-by-side.\r\n \r\nFor discussion, use https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/349"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"973691520728510464","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T22:45:23+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now... join us for the weekly #ASPNET Community Standup at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":12,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"973553523186159621","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T13:37:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Today, Jeff shows you how to use dependency injection with web forms... check it out! https://t.co/viqZ28DBrV","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":25,"FavoriteCount":9,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"973350716046626816","CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T00:11:09+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join us for the weekly #ASPNET Community Standup this Tuesday at 3:45 PM Pacific / 23:45 GMT at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":5,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"972484011556818945","CreatedAt":"2018-03-10T14:47:10+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Be sure to check out Jeff's live coding stream this morning to see more about our #ASP.NET Core 2.1 preview release. https://t.co/EtKk0fMOgU","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":24,"FavoriteCount":10,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"971084152693866496","CreatedAt":"2018-03-06T18:04:38+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"We are live at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2 !

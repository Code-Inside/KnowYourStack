This works reasonably well in the vast majority of cases (most of the time, the 2 seconds is enough), but occasionally, we have to resort to the `TerminateThread` and in a small number of _those_ cases, the thread might be doing something dangerous like holding the OS loader lock.\r\n\r\nI'd like to eventually rewrite this whole mechanism to eliminate `TerminateThread` entirely (as I did in the file watcher in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49696) but given where we are in the .NET 8 schedule, it's important to minimize the risk involved. This change just makes the timeout for thread termination configurable, so that people who are running into issues with this can give the thread more than 2 seconds to exit.\r\n\r\n@BrennanConroy ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49942","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Make stdout/stderr redirection thread timeout configurable\" (#49942)"},{"Id":"1842245296","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-08T23:47:16","Actor":"isadorasophia","Number":"49941","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve error report on HotReloadAgent","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHot Reload may fail while applying code changes, [see this example](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/90037) on applying changes while debugging in VS.

See more in the code comments [in the source files](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/Components/Endpoints/src/Rendering/ViewBufferTextWriter).\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges with the implementation is that there is a circular dependency chain between the `M.A.Components.Endpoints` assembly where these APIs are consumed and the `M.A.Mvc.ViewFeatures` assembly where they are defined: `M.A.Components.Endpoints` -> `M.A.Mvc.ViewFeatures` -> `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Endpoints`.\r\n\r\nWe could possibly move the ViewBuffer-related codepaths to the `Html.Abstractions` since they contain no concrete dependencies on MVC, but we'd have to do some type-forwarding.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49932","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unify ViewBuffer logic between MVC and Blazor\" (#49932)"},{"Id":"1841951244","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-08T19:37:01","Actor":"Eddie-Hartman","Number":"49931","RawContent":null,"Title":"Base Href Changing Or Normal Refresh","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen initially loading a page, the base href is correct, but once you refresh the page, it changes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBase href should not be changing depending on how the page is loaded.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nNavigate here: https://dev.mayvue.com/SNBIPWA/settings\r\nThen refresh the page.\r\n\r\nHard reload the page and see it loads fine.

Create a NextJS project and do `npm install @microsoft/signalr`. Then use the following code:\r\n\r\nProgram.cs file\r\n```\r\npublic class Program\r\n{\r\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\n        // Add services to the container.\r\n        builder.Services.AddAuthorization();\r\n\r\n        // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle\r\n        builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();\r\n        builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            options.CustomSchemaIds(type => type.ToString());\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        // Register FluentValidation validators\r\n        // Commented out because it's irrelevant\r\n        // builder.Services.AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<Program>(ServiceLifetime.Singleton);\r\n\r\n        builder.Services.AddSignalR();\r\n\r\n        builder.Services.AddCors(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            options.AddDefaultPolicy(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.WithOrigins(\"http://localhost:3000\").AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod().AllowCredentials();\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        var app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\n        // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\r\n        if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())\r\n        {\r\n            app.UseSwagger();\r\n            app.UseSwaggerUI();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        //app.UseHttpsRedirection();\r\n\r\n        app.UseCors();\r\n\r\n        app.UseAuthorization();\r\n\r\n        // Commented out because it's irrelevant\r\n        // Assign all routes to a root group\r\n        // var root = app.MapGroup(\"\");\r\n        // Add validation filter to all endpoints under root\r\n        // root.AddEndpointFilterFactory(ValidationFilter.ValidationFilterFactory);\r\n        // root.RegisterEndpoints();\r\n\r\n        app.MapHub<TrackingHub>(\"/tracking\");\r\n\r\n        app.Run();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTrackingHub.cs file\r\n```\r\npublic class TrackingHub : Hub\r\n{\r\n    public async Task SendLocationData(LocationData locationData)\r\n    {\r\n        await Clients.Others.SendAsync(\"ReceiveLocationData\", locationData);\r\n        Console.WriteLine($\"{locationData.Latitude}, {locationData.Longitude}\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class LocationData\r\n{\r\n    public int Longitude { get; set; }\r\n    public int Latitude { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNextJS app:\r\n```\r\nconst page = () => {\r\n    const connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n        .withUrl('http://localhost:5191/tracking',\r\n            {\r\n                // connection only works if I uncomment this\r\n                // skipNegotiation: true,\r\n                // transport: HttpTransportType.WebSockets\r\n            })\r\n        .withAutomaticReconnect()\r\n        .configureLogging(LogLevel.Debug)\r\n        .build()\r\n\r\n    connection.on('ReceiveLocationData', (locationData) => {\r\n        console.log(locationData)\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        const startConnection = async () => {\r\n            try {\r\n                await fetch('http://localhost:5191/users')\r\n                await connection.start()\r\n            }\r\n            catch (error) {\r\n                console.log(\"Failed to start connection: \", error)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        startConnection()\r\n    }, []);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <Map />\r\n    )\r\n}\r\nexport default page\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n7.0.306\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49918","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"SignalR connection doesn't work without setting skipNegotiation to true in NextJS\" (#49918)"},{"Id":"1840950746","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-08T09:37:44","Actor":"wV-software","Number":"49917","RawContent":null,"Title":"In Blazor wasm, the overriden BuildRenderTree is not hit at all","State":"open","Body":"Issure Reproduction steps:\r\n1.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For example the [OnTokenValidated](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/bf303a1092f83d789031fdafac60f3fc454cfc49/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/JwtBearerEvents.cs#L29) event is fired when a security token is validated. These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT. These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

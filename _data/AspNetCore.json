Previously, the validation pipeline only considered classes complex, causing record structs without top-level validation attributes to be skipped entirely.\r\n\r\nFixes #64513\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMinimal API users defining request DTOs as `record struct` were unable to rely on validation attributes inside those types. This led to missing validation errors and inconsistent behavior between classes and record structs. The fix brings record struct behavior in line with classes and improves model consistency without requiring user code changes.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [ ] High\r\n- [ ] Medium\r\n- [x] Low\r\n\r\nThe change expands the definition of “complex type” to include non-primitive value types.

Please describe the problem.\n\nProblem description\nIn Blazor Server, the server has no built-in way (that I'm aware of) to know the client time zone or offset for a given circuit.\n\nThe only reliable source for this information is the browser, but the framework does not expose it once the SignalR connection is established.\n\nThis creates friction for any feature that needs to compare or align server timestamps with the user’s local date and time, for example\n• Showing “today” vs “yesterday” in the user’s local zone\n• Validating input that mixes server deadlines with user input dates\n• Logging and diagnostics that need both server and client perspectives\n\nToday, each app has to implement its own JavaScript interop and per-circuit plumbing for something that feels like core infrastructure.\n\nCurrent behavior and workaround\nIn a Blazor Server app that uses prerendering, a JavaScript file downloads and starts the SignalR connection from client to server. At that point, the client knows its time zone and offset, but the server side has no such information.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nMy current workaround looks like this.\n\n1. In MainLayout.razor, use OnAfterRenderAsync with a guard so it runs only once per circuit.\n2. Call JavaScript to read the client zone or offset, for example via\n   • new Date().getTimezoneOffset()\n   • Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone\n3. Send that value back to a scoped service on the server through JS interop.\n4. Store that in a circuit-scoped service, then inject that service everywhere date logic needs to know the client offset.\n\nThis works, but every Blazor Server app that cares about dates needs to repeat the same pattern. It also has ordering concerns. Anything that runs before MainLayout.OnAfterRenderAsync does not see this information.\n\nProposed enhancement\nWhen the SignalR connection for a Blazor Server circuit is established, the framework should automatically capture client time information and expose it through a server side API that is scoped to that circuit.\n\nOne possible shape.\n\n1. Extend RendererInfo with a property such as RendererInfo.UserTimeZoneOffset or similar.\n   • UserTimeZoneOffset would describe the offset between client local time and UTC at the time of connection.\n   • Optionally, another property could expose the IANA time zone identifier if available, for example RendererInfo.UserTimeZoneId.\n\n2. Provide a simple injectable service that exposes the same values for the current circuit, for example\n\n   public sealed class ClientTimeInfo\n   {\n   public TimeSpan UtcOffset { get; init; }\n   public string TimeZoneId { get; init; }\n   }\n\n   This service would be registered with circuit scope in Blazor Server, so any component or service that runs in that circuit has direct access without custom JS interop.\n\n3. During circuit initialization, the framework would\n   • Call a small script on the client that reads time zone information.\n   • Attach this information to the RendererInfo associated with that circuit.\n   • Populate the ClientTimeInfo service instance.\n\nBenefits\n\n1. Consistent handling of local time across apps\n2. Less boilerplate JS interop for a very common requirement.\n3. Better ability to\n   • Show dates and times that match user expectations.\n   • Implement validation based on business deadlines in server time while still respecting client local time.\n   • Record logs that associate a user action with both server UTC and user local time context.\n\nScope and behavior notes\n• This feature would apply to Blazor Server, where circuits and SignalR are present.\n• For prerendering, the value might not be present during the initial static render, but would be available once the circuit activates. A simple null check on the service would handle that.\n• If full time zone id support is considered out of scope, even a simple numeric offset property would still provide value.\n\nSummary\nBlazor Server already tracks useful information about each circuit through RendererInfo. Time zone information is only available on the client, yet date and time logic often belongs on the server. Exposing a circuit-scoped ClientTimeInfo, possibly backed by properties on RendererInfo such as UserTimeZoneOffset, would remove repeated boilerplate and provide a clean, first-class way to align server timestamps with the user’s local date and time.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nI created my own component which injects the scope service, and then displays the Parameter data, and yields a small popup to show the local time.\n\n<img width=\"350\" height=\"136\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb3ac88-8d66-4f72-8894-39f84b9d4671\"

Await disposes HttpContext.Features of the current HttpRequest","State":"open","Body":"Hi,\n\nI have a crazy problem I don't really understand.\n\nBackground: Old web application, developed Net.Framework.1.1, startet 2006 2.0, later 4.0, two years 8.0, now 10.0, IIS In-Process hosted, Minimal Api.\n\nThe application uses 4 additional services, one is like a session service (replaced the Framework ASP NET State Service), one is something like a cache (but with Db-Checks), one creates pdf files, the latest is a routing calculation. (2)/(3) earlier with NET.Remoting. Now all 4 services are IIS In-Process hosted, Minimal Api, they consume a Xml-Document with the command and parameters and send a Xml-Document back. The client-code executed by the web application and the first part of the server-code of all 4 services is nearly the same, that calls the (sometimes 15 - 20 years old) functions.\n\nLong time I didn't use async / await. Started the last years with the switch to NET.8. Later I found:\n\n```\n_task = _httpClient.PostAsync(...)\n_task.Wait()\n```\n\nis bad, because it blocks the current thread. So I've started to recheck the whole code to find such **.Wait(** and to add **async** on the whole function stack.\n\nBut: Changed that row to\n\n```\nUsing _httpResponseMessage As System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage = Await _httpClient.PostAsync(...)\n```\n\nresults in an error later:\n\n```\nIFeatureCollection has been disposed.\nObject name: 'Collection'.\nat Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FeatureReferences`1.ThrowContextDisposed()\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FeatureReferences`1.ContextDisposed()\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FeatureReferences`1.Fetch[TFeature](TFeature& cached, Func`2 factory)\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.DefaultHttpRequest.get_Cookies()\n```\n\ntrying to read the number of cookies of the request. Rechecked the code, no missing Await found. The error happens in the client of the session service, trying to read the session. If the browser doesn't send a cookie, no crash.\n\nLooks like using Await changes the thread and removes handles to HttpContext-Objects, so these objects are disposed.\n\nBut normally different calls of the same function should not affect the life span of other objects.\n\nAdditional observation: If I add a private variable this_CookieCollection to my main class and initialize it with HttpRequest.Cookies, that crash can be removed. But then follows the next crash with HttpRequest.QueryString and the same type of error message. It's not possible to fix that bug using the same idea.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64507","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Replace task.Wait() with Await disposes HttpContext.Features of the current HttpRequest\" (#64507)"},{"Id":"3655733795","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-23T11:33:46","Actor":"somnatic","Number":"64501","RawContent":null,"Title":"Generation of OpenApi document conflicts with Kiota's expectations","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI've been doing some tests with .NET10, OpenApi and Kiota recently and stumbled upon something that seems odd. I cannot really consider it a bug but it's something I would like to point out. If this is by design, that's ok with me as well.\n\nI have put together a fully working demo here: https://github.com/somnatic/openapi-int32-issue-demo. It's basically the \"ASP.NET Core Web API\" project template. Not a single line was changed.\n\nThis project generates an OpenApi definition with the following definition for `temperatureC`  (the full document is also in the Github project):\n\n```json\n          \"temperatureC\": {\n            \"pattern\": \"^-?(?:0|[1-9]\\\\d*)$\",\n            \"type\": [\n              \"integer\",\n              \"string\"\n            ],\n            \"format\": \"int32\"\n          },\n``` \n\nAccording to the OpenApi spec this is essentially correct: \"can be an integer or a string, needs to follow a specific pattern\"\n\nNow, when generating a client with Kiota, Kiota will output the following warning:\n\n```shell\nwarn: Kiota.Builder.KiotaBuilder[0]\n      OpenAPI warning: #/components/schemas/WeatherForecast/properties/temperatureC - The format int32 is not supported by Kiota for the type Integer, String and the string type will be used.\n``` \n\nI can force AddOpenApi using a SchemaTransformer for \"int\" I can make AddOpenApi generate the following definition which Kiota will perfectly accept.\n\n```json\n         \"temperatureC\": {\n            \"pattern\": \"^-?(?:0|[1-9]\\\\d*)$\",\n            \"type\": [\n              \"integer\",\n              \"string\"\n            ],\n            \"format\": \"int32\"\n          },\n``` \n\nNow basically my question or proposal is: Shouldn't this be the default behavior?\n\nI just hope this question isn't too stupid or the solution too obvious.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI'd expect the integer creation as outlined above to be the default\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nProject is here:\nhttps://github.com/somnatic/openapi-int32-issue-demo\n\nYou can un-comment the `TypeTransformer.MapType<int>(new OpenApiSchema {Type = JsonSchemaType.Integer, Format = \"int32\"});` to see what happens if we force the creation of a normal int type.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64501","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generation of OpenApi document conflicts with Kiota's expectations\" (#64501)"},{"Id":"3655641508","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-23T08:14:00","Actor":"khteh","Number":"64500","RawContent":null,"Title":"gRPC integration test `TStartup` = `Program.cs` throws `\"A public method named 'ConfigureIntegrationTests' or 'Configure' could not be found in the 'Program' type.\"`","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44906 is NOT resolved!

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?   I am following the code here even though we have normal MVC and not razor pages like you have in the example.  I am still just calling \r\n\r\n>var signInUserResult = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(userName, password, rememberMe, true);\r\n\r\nNote: I am using Asp .net Identity in Identity server 4 application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/2079","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remember me isPersistent understanding\" (#2079)"},{"Id":"383297898","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-21T22:08:40","Actor":"mmillican","Number":"2080","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace a Role Validator","State":"closed","Body":"I am trying to create a custom role validator to support pseudo-multi-tenancy (which I know is not _officially_ supported in Identity) and am running into some issues.\r\n\r\nI've verified that my validator does work and is being called.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For more information, visit https://aka.ms/aspnet/deprecate/004.\n\nUsing `IWebHost` or `WebHost` will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID **ASPDEPR008**:\n> warning ASPDEPR008: WebHost is obsolete. Use HostBuilder or WebApplicationBuilder instead.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

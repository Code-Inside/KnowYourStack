Please describe the problem.\n\nI have a service registered as a singleton that maintains a list of the pages a user has visited in their current session that I use to identify whether some parts of the site should promoted more or less based on their measured interest. I'd like to use the WebAssembly mode of a .NET 8 Web App to reduce load on my server but it occurs to me that as users are transitioned from the Server project to the Client project, they'll effectively be starting over with a new WASM-registered client and lose that data.\r\n\r\nWhile this scenario could just as easily see the data persisted somewhere like local or server storage and recalled during service initialization, that's not always feasible with services that temporarily persist data not intended to be serialized. For example, the [Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor) package provides a Flux/Redux approach to managing state on a single global store, but where it's Store may be initialized on the Server and data persisted to it, the jump to the Client project means that the single state store is lost as it's re-initialized in the new context.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeally, rather than having a separate DI registration for server and client, I'd like to see the client be able to inherit select registrations from the server so that as this transition happens, the current service state can be cloned into the client as though nothing ever happened. How that happens though, no idea.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of that, some sort of channel to call a method on the service in the other context and provide a class/record with the current state so I could pre-seed it would be helpful (this would need to be bi-directional so both contexts could stay in sync).\r\n\r\nIdeally, just something that ensure that no matter the content\n\n### Additional context\n\nPlease consider adding another tab with recommendations of how to approach this to the [state management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/state-management?view=aspnetcore-8.0&pivots=webassembly) documentation.

It would be nice to have an API for this scenario for registering health checks in consistency with the other extension methods, such as:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static IHealthChecksBuilder AddCheck<T>(\r\n    this IHealthChecksBuilder builder,\r\n    string name,\r\n    HealthStatus? failureStatus,\r\n    IEnumerable<string> tags) where T : class, IHealthCheck\r\n```\r\netc...\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nThe API I would like to propose is as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnamespace Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\n\r\npublic static class HealthChecksBuilderAddCheckExtensions\r\n{\r\n    // existing code omitted for brevity\r\n    \r\n    public static IHealthChecksBuilder AddCheck<T>(\r\n        this IHealthChecksBuilder builder,\r\n        string name,\r\n        Func<IServiceProvider, IHealthCheck> factory,\r\n        HealthStatus? failureStatus = null,\r\n        IEnumerable<string>? tags = null) where T : class, IHealthCheck\r\n    {\r\n        return builder.Add(new HealthCheckRegistration(name, factory, failureStatus, tags));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nThe usage of this API would simplify registering of a health check that requires the use of the `IServiceProvider`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nservices.AddHealthChecks()\r\n    .AddCheck(\"DbConnectionCheck\", sp =>\r\n    {\r\n        var configuration = sp.GetRequiredService<IConfiguration>();\r\n\tvar connectionString = configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnectionString\");\r\n\tvar provider = configuration.GetValue<string>(\"Configuration:DbProvider\");\r\n\treturn new DbConnectionCheck(connectionString, dbProvider);\r\n    }, HealthStatus.Unhealthy, new[] { \"dependency\", \"db-dependency\" });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nNo known

It slows down the startup of the site by multiple seconds.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt shouldn't recompile views when SHA256 is used.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.200\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54445","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AddRazorRuntimeCompilation do not work with .net8 or recent version of visual studio\" (#54445)"},{"Id":"2176563471","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-08T18:32:14","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"54443","RawContent":null,"Title":".net 8 Blazor WASM project  AOT fails ","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/net-8-Blazor-WASM-project--AOT-fails-/10611271)._\n\n---\nOur AOT fails in Visual Studio 2022 when we manually try to publish.

We have one handler which will handle all exceptions by logging them, creating a ProblemDetails response and return true if we were able to handle this all successful. But after some time we saw in our logs the same exception logged by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` logger with the message `An unhandled exception has occurred while executing the request.` again.\r\nThis surprised us as the exception was handled successfully by our handler which returned true. After some research we think that found the reason for this in the middleware implementation. At [line 130](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Middleware/Diagnostics/src/ExceptionHandler/ExceptionHandlerMiddlewareImpl.cs#L130) the exception will be logged as unhandled but the handlers are checked way later in [line 173](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Middleware/Diagnostics/src/ExceptionHandler/ExceptionHandlerMiddlewareImpl.cs#L173).\r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\nOur idea would be to log a exception as unhandled with level error only after all possible handlers are checked and none of them was able to handle the exception to prevent confusion of a unhandled exception error log for a already handled and logged exception.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54433","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missleading unhandled exception error log\" (#54433)"},{"Id":"2175715376","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-08T10:15:14","Actor":"Tornhoof","Number":"54432","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor SSR: Partially invalid UI Refresh after submitting EditForm","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nIn a form with multiple input boxes (bool, text, select multiple), a submit without any changes changes the output to be invald:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT. These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

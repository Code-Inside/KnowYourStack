Please describe the problem.\n\nI am trying to add additional logging properties when logging from Blazor Server components and related services. I want to be able to log the current URL (not just the original request URL -- by default, ASP.NET Core logs the `RequestPath` as `/blazor`, which is useless). There's a lot of other situation-dependent properties that would be nice to include that are only known by the Blazor components and other services that are within the circuit's service scope (for example, which tab does the user have selected within a tab component like MudTabs).\n\nI can set some scoped logging properties somewhat reliably by defining a `IHubFilter` and calling `_logger.BeginScope` from there. I am using Serilog, which respects the log scope data that is set (uses AsyncLocal). But from the IHubFilter, I am not able to get the data I need because it is in a different IServiceProvider scope than the Blazor circuit service scope. I'm also not sure if IHubFilter will work to add logging scope data if a render is triggered by something other than an incoming SignalR call, like a timer. \n\nYou'd think a scoped CircuitHandler would be a place to be able to start the logging scope, but the virtual methods that it contains is limited. It does not have any method that is invoked for every SignalR call. If you start a logging scope from the OnCircuitOpenedAsync, the logging scope effectively ends any future events and rerenders will be in a different async call stack (related to how AsyncLocal works).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe current solution I'm using involves having a base component class that all of my components inherit from that overrides OnParametersSet() and OnAfterRender() and to check if the logging scope has started yet for the current SignalR call. This seems horribly inefficient because I'm checking AsyncLocal data for each render and for each component. It's also not 100% reliable.\n\nI think I need something similar to `IHubFilter`/`CircuitHandler` except it can hook into any event that runs on the `RendererStynchronizationContext`/`CircuitHost` to provide a place that is completely reliable for adding logging scoped data from the circuit's scoped services.\n\nExample of what that might look like:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddScoped<IRendererListener, MyRendererListener>();\n```\n\n```csharp\nclass MyRendererListener : IRendererListener\n{\n    // scope is the Blazor circuit's service scope\n    public void OnRenderEvent(IServiceProvider scope)\n    {\n        scope.GetRequiredService<ILogger<MyRendererListener>>().BeginScope(scope.GetRequiredService<MyScopedLoggingData>())\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nI've been looking everywhere for a solution for this. I've explored using ASP.NET Core middleware, CircuitHandler, IHubFilter, custom component base classes, custom logger types. I haven't been able to find a good solution for this. I've looked up and down the call stacks at various points to try to figure out how I can hook in some code where I'd need to, but I haven't been able to find it.

This creates issues for enhanced navigation scenarios where:\n\n- Components show stale data briefly before fetching fresh data (flickering)\n- Components unnecessarily re-fetch data that could be provided via state\n- Developers have no clean way to opt-in/out of state updates per scenario\n- Behavior is unpredictable - developers can't control when components receive state updates\n\n## Solution\n\nThis implementation provides a layered API that allows developers to specify per-property when state should be restored based on the restoration scenario (prerendering, enhanced navigation, server reconnection).\n\n### Core Infrastructure\n\n- **`IPersistentComponentStateScenario`**: Extensible marker interface for restoration scenarios with `IsRecurring` property\n- **`IPersistentStateFilter`**: Interface for declarative filtering logic \n- **`RestoringComponentStateSubscription`**: IDisposable subscription for restoration callbacks\n\n### Web-Specific Components\n\n- **`WebPersistenceReason`**: Enum with flags for `Prerendering`, `EnhancedNavigation`, and `Reconnection`\n- **`WebPersistenceContext`**: Concrete scenario implementation with render mode support\n\n### Declarative Filter Attributes\n\n- **`UpdateStateOnEnhancedNavigationAttribute`**: Restores state only during enhanced navigation\n- **`RestoreStateOnPrerenderingAttribute`**: Restores state only during prerendering\n- **`RestoreStateOnReconnectionAttribute`**: Restores state only after server reconnection\n\nAll attributes include render mode compatibility checks to ensure they only apply in appropriate contexts.\n\n### Enhanced State Management\n\n- **`PersistentComponentState`**: Added scenario-aware restoration with `RegisterOnRestoring()` and `UpdateExistingState()`\n- **`ComponentStatePersistenceManager`**: Added `RestoreStateAsync(store, scenario)` overload\n- **Value Provider**: Enhanced with automatic scenario filtering using reflection\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Data Grid (receives updated state on navigation)\n```razor\n@inject PersistentComponentState AppState\n\n<table>\n    @if (forecasts != null)\n    {\n        @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)\n        {\n            <tr><td>@forecast.Date</td><td>@forecast.TemperatureC</td></tr>\n        }\n    }\n</table>\n\n@code {\n    [SupplyParameterFromPersistentComponentState]\n    [UpdateStateOnEnhancedNavigation]\n    public WeatherForecast[]? forecasts { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n### Form (preserves user input, doesn't receive new state)\n```razor\n@inject PersistentComponentState AppState\n\n<EditForm Model=\"model\">\n    <InputText @bind-Value=\"model.Name\" />\n    <InputText @bind-Value=\"model.Email\" />\n</EditForm>\n\n@code {\n    [SupplyParameterFromPersistentComponentState]\n    [RestoreStateOnPrerendering] // Only restore on prerendering, not navigation\n    public ContactModel model { get; set; } = new();\n}\n```\n\n### Imperative API\n```csharp\nprotected override void OnInitialized()\n{\n    AppState.RegisterOnRestoring(WebPersistenceContext.EnhancedNavigation, () =>\n    {\n        if (AppState.TryTakeFromJson<WeatherForecast[]>(\"weather-data\", out var data))\n        {\n            forecasts = data;\n            StateHasChanged();\n        }\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing APIs continue to work unchanged\n- **Extensible Design**: New scenarios can be added by implementing `IPersistentComponentStateScenario`\n- **Performance**: Minimal overhead - filtering only occurs when scenarios are active\n- **Safety**: State can only be updated when the existing state dictionary is empty (fully consumed)\n\n## Testing\n\n- Comprehensive unit tests covering all new functionality\n- Tests verify scenario creation, equality, filtering logic, and attribute behavior\n- All tests pass and maintain existing functionality\n\nFixes #51584.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

After fixing this test, we uncovered an issue with fetching 404 page by the client.\r\n\r\n  It turns out that in the cases when the `NotFound` was called synchronously, it was reaching the enhanced navigation code on client earlier that initialization of enhanced navigation in `boot` function. To fix this we did 2 things:\r\n  - moved enhanced nav initialization as early as possible in `boot` (just a cosmetic change),\r\n  - changed `navigationEnhancementCallbacks` to a promise, so that we make sure it's not `undefined` when we enter `performEnhancedPageLoad`.\r\n\r\n- [x] `NotFound` page didn't get rendered if `NavigationManager.NotFound()` got called after an async operation. It's because we are making sure nothing gets rendered after the current render batch. We are stopping the renderer after setting the 404 code. The Router was queueing rendering of 404 page after the \"stop\" signal.\r\n\r\n  We used to test async operations with streaming enabled and no-streaming was tested with sync operations only. Test cases with `_AfterAsyncOperation_ResponseNotStarted_SSR` were added to cover POST and GET scenarios of this kind.\r\n\r\n  To fix it, we changed the `SignalRendererToFinishRendering` methods to `RequestRendererToFinishRendering`. Now, when setting the 404 code we only signal the need to stop the renderer in the future. Then, we stop it for real after the quiescence task is finished.\r\n\r\n  Because we already observed a similar problem with POST requests, we were working that around by using fetch on the client to show 404 page in POSTs. In this PR we could remove the workaround and follow the same pattern as for GETs. This introduced a change in \"NotFoundSetOnFormSubmit\" tests. POST does not behave anymore as response started.\r\n\r\nFixes #62469","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62524","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Endpoint renderer waits for quiescence with stopping the rendering\" (#62524)"},{"Id":"3192875417","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-01T15:10:18","Actor":"mrpmorris","Number":"62523","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use IStructurallyEqual in ChangeDetection","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nThere have been various suggestions in the past for ways to get Blazor to detect when the state of an instance of a reference type is unaltered and therefore a child will not need to re-render when its parent renders.\n\n1. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/13610\n2. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40867\n3. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21915\n\nAll have been closed, but I am here to hash out a new idea :)\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIn the ChangeDetection class, have it also check if the new value implements `IStructuralEquality`. If so, then ask it if it is structurally equal to the old value.\n\nThat way, we can write code like this when working with immutable reference types.\n\n```c#\npublic readonly record ImmutablePerson : IStructuralEquatable\n{\n    public required string FamilyName { get; init; }\n    public required string PersonalName { get; init; }\n\n    bool IStructuralEquatable.Equals(object other, IEqualityComparer comparer) =>\n        ReferenceEquals(this, other);\n\n    int IStructuralEquatable.GetHashCode(IEqualityComparer comparer) =>\n        GetHashCode();\n}\n```\n\nOr like this for mutable reference types (as Array already implements it).\n\n```c#\npublic class Order : IStructuralEquatable\n{\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public int CustomerId { get; set; }\n    public OrderLine[] Lines { get; set; } = [];\n\n    bool IStructuralEquatable.Equals(object? obj, IEqualityComparer comparer) =>\n        obj is Order other\n        && other.Id == Id\n        && other.CustomerId == CustomerId\n        && StructuralComparisons.StructuralEqualityComparer.Equals(Lines, other.Lines);\n\n    int IStructuralEquatable.GetHashCode(IEqualityComparer comparer) =>\n        HashCode.Combine(\n            Id,\n            CustomerId,\n            StructuralComparisons.StructuralEqualityComparer.GetHashCode(Lines)\n        );\n}\n\npublic class OrderLine : IStructuralEquatable\n{\n    public int ProductId { get; set; }\n    public uint Quantity { get; set; }\n\n    bool IStructuralEquatable.Equals(object? obj, IEqualityComparer comparer) =>\n        obj is OrderLine other\n        && other.ProductId == ProductId\n        && other.Quantity == Quantity;\n\n\n    int IStructuralEquatable.GetHashCode(IEqualityComparer comparer) =>\n        HashCode.Combine(ProductId, Quantity);\n}\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nI think the following changes to `ChangeDetection.MayHaveChanged` might suffice.\n\n```c#\nstatic bool MayHaveChanged<T1, T2>(T1 oldValue, T2 newValue)\n{\n    var oldIsNotNull = oldValue != null;\n    var newIsNotNull = newValue != null;\n    if (oldIsNotNull != newIsNotNull)\n    {\n        return true; // One's null and the other isn't, so different\n    }\n    else if (oldIsNotNull) // i.e., both are not null (considering previous check)\n    {\n        // *** New check for StructuralEquatable ***\n        if (oldValue is IStructuralEquatable structuralEquatable)\n        {\n            return !structuralEquatable.Equals(newValue, EqualityComparer<T1>.Default);\n        }\n\n        var oldValueType = oldValue!.GetType();\n        var newValueType = newValue!.GetType();\n        if (oldValueType != newValueType            // Definitely different\n            || !IsKnownImmutableType(oldValueType)  // Maybe different\n            || !oldValue.Equals(newValue))          // Somebody says they are different\n        {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // By now we know either both are null, or they are the same immutable type\n    // and ThatType::Equals says the two values are equal.\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nNote: Related issue in .Net runtime that would ensure this works for parameters of type `List<T>` etc - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/117199","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/62523","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Use IStructurallyEqual in ChangeDetection\" (#62523)"},{"Id":"3192808142","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-01T14:49:40","Actor":"rgroenewoudt","Number":"62522","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow disabling static assets compression for specific files","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

The test shows that only the actual record properties (like `Name` with `[Required]`) are included, not the compiler-generated `EqualityContract`.\n\nAll existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no regressions.\n\nFixes #62510.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

ModelA2: This represents the return type from 4.b (Note: ModelB will have a ref to #/components/schemas/ModelA)\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nAs of net9.0, support for Swagger (NSwag) is deprecated in favour of OpenAPI. We are rewriting our API documentation layer to use OpenAPI so that we can transition to LTS version net10.0. However, using OpenAPI has the following effect:\n\nUsing the OpenAPI.json definition described above, our team generates an API Client for service consumers. As a result:\n1. There a hundreds more lines of .json and API Client .cs code.\n1. Previously, the API Client (generated from Swagger 2.0), would aggressively de-duplicate the schemas to ensure 1 schema definition for a singular DTO / model.\n\nThe extra Schemas are a breaking change as our API consumers will now need to react to:\n1. Changing from ModelA to ModelAx\n2. It is programmatically cumbersome to determine which variant of schema to use in code. \n\n## Minimum Repro steps:\n\n.csproj:\n\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\n\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.OpenApi\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n\n</Project>\n```\n\nProgram.cs:\n```\n\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\nusing Microsoft.OpenApi.Models;\n\nWebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\n// Add services to the container.\nbuilder.Services.AddControllers();\nbuilder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();\n\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenApi();\n\nWebApplication app = builder.Build();\n\nif (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())\n{\n    app.MapOpenApi();\n}\n\napp.UseHttpsRedirection();\napp.UseAuthorization();\napp.MapControllers();\n\napp.Run();\n\n```\nModels / DTOS:\n\n```\npublic class ApiResponse<T>\n{\n    public T?

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

For example, \"foobar\" will be treated as the default scheme in the code below.\r\n```\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddOAuth(\"foobar\");\r\n```\r\nThis change might expose unintended behavior changes in applications, such as authentication options being validated earlier than expected.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n.NET 7 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously, when users did not provide a default scheme in the `AddAuthentication` call, no default scheme was set.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis impacted the behavior of authentication handlers in the application layer.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nMoving forward, if (and only if) a _single_ scheme is registered in an application, that scheme will be treated as the default. In the code below, the `CookieDefaults.AuthenticationScheme` will be treated as the default scheme.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the code snippet below, no default will be set because multiple schemes are registered.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie().AddJwtBearer();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nTo reduce boilerplate when configuring authentication and set up sensible defaults.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe change only impacts applications with a single scheme registered. For those scenarios, it's recommended to ensure that your application is prepared to handle the assumption that a single scheme is the default. For example, the options associated with that scheme should be configured correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.SuppressAutoDefaultScheme` app context flag.\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication APIs.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/490","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Changes in default authentication scheme handling for ASP.NET Core\" (#490)"},{"Id":"1287742787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T18:44:22","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"488","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nAs detailed in dotnet/aspnetcore#42413, the file-serving middleware (`DefaultFilesMiddleware`, `DirectoryBrowserMiddleware`, and `StaticFileMiddleware`) have been updated to no longer no-op (i.e. defer to the next middleware in the pipeline) in the case that there is an active endpoint with a `null` request delegate.\r\n\r\nPR that makes the change: dotnet/aspnetcore#42458\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nPreviously, if the current request had an active endpoint, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint() != null`, the file-serving middleware would perform no action and simply delegate to the next middleware in the request pipeline.\n\n### New behavior\n\nThe file-serving middleware will now only perform no action if there is an active endpoint and its `RequestDelegate` property value is not `null`, i.e. `HttpContext.GetEndpoint()?.RequestDelegate is not null`.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing code and binaries may experience different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThis change will enable endpoints to be active in the request for the purposes of setting and sharing metadata with middleware that are endpoint-aware so that they can perform their intended function, while allowing other middleware (like the file-serving middleware) that would usually defer their behavior when an endpoint is active to also function.\r\n\r\nFor example, an endpoint with a `null` request delegate containing authorization metadata can be set as the active endpoint for a request, causing the `AuthorizationMiddleware` to enforce authorization requirements, which if satisfied would allow the `StaticFileMiddleware` to serve the requested files.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you are relying on setting an active endpoint on the request to suppress the behavior of the file-serving middleware, ensure that the endpoint has a non-null value set for its `RequestDelegate` property.\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseStaticFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDefaultFiles()`\r\n- `IApplicationBuilder.UseDirectoryBrowser()`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/488","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Static files, default document, and directory browsing middleware no longer no-op when an endpoint with a null RequestDelegate is active\" (#488)"},{"Id":"1278667050","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T16:03:03","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"487","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Unit testing SignalR Hubs may need updating","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`IHubClients` and `IHubCallerClients` now hide interface members `IClientProxy Client(string connectionId);` and `IClientProxy Caller { get;

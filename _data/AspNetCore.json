Happy to provide additional debugging information or test potential fixes.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`Handlebars.Compile()` should be callable indefinitely without causing browser hangs, consistent with behavior in:\n- .NET 8 Blazor WASM\n- .NET 10 server-side / console applications\n- Debug builds\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```csharp\n// Minimal reproduction - Blazor WASM page\n@page \"/\"\n@using HandlebarsDotNet\n\n<h1>Handlebars WASM Hang Test</h1>\n<p>Iterations: @_count</p>\n<button @onclick=\"RunTest\">Start Test</button>\n\n@code {\n    private int _count;\n    private static readonly IHandlebars Hb = Handlebars.Create();\n\n    private async Task RunTest()\n    {\n        while (true)\n        {\n            _count++;\n\n            // This call eventually hangs the browser\n            var template = Hb.Compile(\"Hello {{name}}!\");\n            var result = template(new { name = \"World\" });\n\n            StateHasChanged();\n            await Task.Delay(1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Critical:** Must be tested as a **published Release build**:\n```bash\ndotnet publish -c Release\ncd bin/Release/net10.0/publish/wwwroot\nnpx http-server -p 8080 -c-1\n# Open http://localhost:8080\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nNone\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.101\n\n### Anything else?\n\n**Investigation findings:**\n\nThrough extensive debugging with skip flags at various points in the compilation pipeline, we identified that the hang occurs during the creation of `HandlebarsConfigurationAdapter` in `HandlebarsEnvironment.Compile()`. Specifically:\n\n1. The adapter constructor performs significant work including:\n   - LINQ operations (`.Select()`, `.OrderBy()`, `.ToList()`)\n   - Reflection (`.GetTypeInfo().GetCustomAttribute<>()`)\n   - Feature creation via `CreateFeature()`\n   - Observable collection setup with subscriptions\n\n2. A workaround that caches the configuration adapter (avoiding recreation on each compile) delays but does not fully prevent the hang.\n\n**Attempted mitigations (none resolved the issue):**\n- `<WasmEnableJiterpreter>false</WasmEnableJiterpreter>`\n- `<TieredPGO>false</TieredPGO>`\n- `<RunAOTCompilation>false</RunAOTCompilation>`\n- `<WasmEnableWebcil>false</WasmEnableWebcil>`\n- `<WasmBuildNative>false</WasmBuildNative>`\n- `<RunWasmOpt>false</RunWasmOpt>`\n- `<BlazorWebAssemblyEnableLinking>false</BlazorWebAssemblyEnableLinking>`\n- `<PublishTrimmed>false</PublishTrimmed>`\n\n[handlebars-wasm-hang-repro.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24146019/handlebars-wasm-hang-repro.zip)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64765","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET 10 Blazor WASM hang\" (#64765)"},{"Id":"3725824587","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-13T11:09:42","Actor":"lskyum","Number":"64764","RawContent":null,"Title":"Suggestion for a @renderkey in Blazor's Razor syntax","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nUI's with many components like lists, trees and tables can perform really bad, because too many components gets rendered at every update. The Blazor change detecting easily gets thrown off because of event handlers like:\n\n```\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <Item OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(item))\">Click me</Item>\n}\n```\n\nBecause the event handler is a new delegate object each render the whole Item component also gets rendered.\nOne fix is to implement ShouldRender in the Item component, but that gets really tedious.\n\nI have made my own RenderBlocker component that simply takes a Key and uses it to evaluate if a new render is needed. Internally it uses ShouldRender and compares the Key to previous render.\n\nUsed like this:\n\n```\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <RenderBlocker Key=\"@item\">\n        <Item OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(item))\">Click me</Item>\n    </RenderBlocker>\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe suggestion is to add a @renderkey to the razor syntax that behaves exactly like my custom RenderBlocker component.\n\n```\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <Item @renderkey=\"@item\" OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(item))\">Click me</Item>\n}\n```\n\nMaybe extended with custom comparer:\n```\n@foreach (var item in items)\n{\n    <Item @renderkey=\"@item\" @renderkey:comparer=\"@MyComparer\" OnClick=\"@(() => HandleClick(item))\">Click me</Item>\n}\n```\n\nBecause item is the same as last render, the whole component is re-used. (And also sub components)\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nNote that the existing @key doesn't solve this issue, but my suggestion with @renderkey follows a similar syntax.\n\nThe code for RenderBlocker in case anyone needs it:\n```\n@typeparam TKey\n\n@ChildContent\n\n@code {\n\t[Parameter]\n\tpublic RenderFragment? ChildContent { get; set; }\n\n\t[Parameter]\n\tpublic TKey? Key { get; set; }\n\n\t[Parameter]\n\tpublic IEqualityComparer<TKey>?

This issue only affected properties in `[AsParameters]` classes, not direct parameters.\r\n\r\nExample that failed before this fix:\r\n```csharp\r\napp.MapPost(\"/api/documents\", ([AsParameters] DocumentUploadRequest request) =>\r\n{\r\n    return Results.Ok(new { Count = request.Values?.Count() ?? 0 });\r\n});\r\n\r\npublic class DocumentUploadRequest\r\n{\r\n    public IFormFile? File { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [FromForm]\r\n    public IEnumerable<int> Values { get; set; }  // threw InvalidOperationException\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### This PR\r\n\r\nThis PR follows the same pattern as PR #63072 (which fixed `string[]` arrays) by extending simple binding to handle collection interfaces:\r\n\r\n**Key Changes:**\r\n1. **Added `IsBindableCollectionInterface()` helper** - Detects collection interface types that can be treated as arrays\r\n2. **Extended binding decision logic** - Routes collection interfaces through simple binding when used as `AsParameters` properties\r\n3. **Updated `BindParameterFromValue()`** - Creates arrays internally and converts them to the target collection type (cast for interfaces, constructor for `List<T>`)\r\n4. **Updated `GetExpressionType()`** - Made it parameter-aware to treat collection interfaces as `string[]` only for `AsParameters` properties\r\n5. **Scoped to `PropertyAsParameterInfo`** - Preserves complex binding for direct `[FromForm]` parameters to maintain backward compatibility\r\n\r\n### What Now Works\r\n\r\n `IEnumerable<T>` with `[AsParameters]` and `[FromForm]`\r\n `IList<T>` with `[AsParameters]` and `[FromForm]`\r\n `ICollection<T>` with `[AsParameters]` and `[FromForm]`\r\n `List<T>` with `[AsParameters]` and `[FromForm]`\r\n\r\nWhere `T` is `string` or any type with a valid `TryParse` method.\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility\r\n\r\n **No breaking changes** - All existing tests pass\r\n **Scoped fix** - Only applies to `[AsParameters]` properties\r\n **Direct parameters unchanged** - `([FromForm] List<int> items)` still uses complex binding for nested key support like `[\"[0]\"]`, `[\"[1]\"]`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdded comprehensive unit tests:\r\n- `RequestDelegateHandlesAsParametersWithFromFormIEnumerable` - Tests IEnumerable<int>\r\n- `RequestDelegateHandlesAsParametersWithFromFormIList` - Tests IList<int>\r\n- `RequestDelegateHandlesAsParametersWithFromFormList` - Tests List<int>\r\n- `RequestDelegateHandlesAsParametersWithFromFormIEnumerableString` - Tests IEnumerable<string>\r\n- `RequestDelegateHandlesAsParametersWithFromFormIntArray` - Tests int[] to verify no regression\r\n\r\nAll 2,111 tests (2,106 existing + 5 new) pass successfully.\r\n\r\nFixes #62329\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64753","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix/asparameters fromform collection interfaces\" (#64753)"},{"Id":"3724187753","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-12T17:07:38","Actor":"guardrex","Number":"64752","RawContent":null,"Title":"NIT: Returns in project template files","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nNIT, so only if interested ......\n\nGH complains about files not ending on a blank line (i.e., LF on the last code line).

Moreover, going through the implementation, I've refactored to improve performance here and there. The results are listed below.\r\n\r\nThe main idea of the improvement is to use the DataProtection API, which does not make us allocate any buffer. This is a hot-path in Antiforgery, because token serialization and deserialization may happen multiple times for different tokens per single request.\r\n\r\nBefore, we had to allocate a buffer, fill it in with the token data, pass it into the `dataProtector` and later we were using streams API, which also allocate and may be doing extra job instead of writing to the destination buffer. There are less of extra types used today, which should give some benefit to the usage.\r\n\r\nI have tested the changes via crank, but unfortunately I dont see a heavy improvement in RPS speed (around 4% RPS improvement only). I suspect those improvements mostly focus on allocation reduction, meaning in the long run it will give more RPS.\r\n\r\n**IAntiforgeryTokenSerializer**\r\n\r\n| branch |      Method |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev |      Op/s |  Gen 0 | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Allocated |\r\n|-------:|------------:|---------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|------:|------:|----------:|\r\n|  main  |   Serialize | 2.221 us | 0.0245 us | 0.0229 us | 450,239.5 | 0.0076 |     - |     - |     872 B |\r\n|  main  | Deserialize | 2.436 us | 0.0463 us | 0.1036 us | 410,492.5 | 0.0076 |     - |     - |     632 B |\r\n|        |             |          |           |           |           |        |       |       |           |\r\n| change |   Serialize | 1.932 us | 0.0110 us | 0.0098 us | 517,688.9 | 0.0038 |     - |     - |     544 B |\r\n| change | Deserialize | 1.927 us | 0.0107 us | 0.0100 us | 519,058.2 | 0.0038 |     - |     - |     344 B |\r\n\r\n**IAntiforgeryTokenGenerator**\r\n\r\n| branch  |                             Method |        Mean |     Error |    StdDev  |            Op/s |  Gen 0 | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Allocated |\r\n|--------:|----------------------------------- |------------:|----------:|-----------:|----------------:|-------:|------:|------:|----------:|\r\n|  main   |     GenerateRequestToken_Anonymous |  11.0555 ns | 0.1203 ns | 0.1066 ns  |    90,452,434.9 | 0.0007 |     - |     - |      56 B |\r\n|  main   | GenerateRequestToken_Authenticated | 401.2545 ns | 7.1693 ns | 6.3554 ns  |     2,492,184.2 | 0.0076 |     - |     - |     592 B |\r\n|  main   |      TryValidateTokenSet_Anonymous |   6.7227 ns | 0.0357 ns | 0.0316 ns  |   148,750,552.9 |      - |     - |     - |         - |\r\n|  main   |  TryValidateTokenSet_Authenticated | 508.1742 ns | 4.4728 ns | 3.7350 ns  |     1,967,829.1 | 0.0095 |     - |     - |     760 B |\r\n|  main   |    TryValidateTokenSet_ClaimsBased | 308.4674 ns | 3.3256 ns | 3.1108 ns  |     3,241,833.1 | 0.0038 |     - |     - |     312 B |\r\n|         |                                    |             |           |            |                 |        |       |       |           |\r\n| change  |     GenerateRequestToken_Anonymous |  11.190 ns  | 0.2428 ns |  0.6046 ns |  89,364,681.9   | 0.0007 |     - |     - |      56 B |\r\n| change  | GenerateRequestToken_Authenticated | 338.056 ns  | 6.7313 ns | 14.9161 ns |   2,958,092.2   | 0.0052 |     - |     - |     424 B |\r\n| change  |      TryValidateTokenSet_Anonymous |   7.966 ns  | 0.1616 ns |  0.2915 ns | 125,531,038.3   |      - |     - |     - |         - |\r\n| change  |  TryValidateTokenSet_Authenticated |  13.386 ns  | 0.2476 ns |  0.3550 ns |  74,707,554.5   |      - |     - |     - |         - |\r\n| change  |    TryValidateTokenSet_ClaimsBased | 220.111 ns  | 4.2723 ns |  5.7034 ns |   4,543,156.3   | 0.0014 |     - |     - |     120 B |\r\n\r\n**IAntiforgery**\r\n| branch |               Method |     Mean |    Error |   StdDev |     Op/s | Gen 0 | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Allocated |\r\n|-------:|--------------------- |---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|------:|------:|------:|----------:|\r\n|  main  |    GetAndStoreTokens | 59.56 us | 2.482 us | 7.082 us | 16,789.6 |     - |     - |     - |      5 KB |\r\n|  main  | ValidateRequestAsync | 50.60 us | 2.150 us | 6.167 us | 19,764.1 |     - |     - |     - |      4 KB |\r\n|        |                      |          |          |          |          |       |       |       |           |\r\n| change |    GetAndStoreTokens | 49.62 us | 1.386 us | 3.954 us | 20,153.9 |     - |     - |     - |      3 KB |\r\n| change | ValidateRequestAsync | 43.67 us | 1.541 us | 4.471 us | 22,900.6 |     - |     - |     - |      3 KB |\r\n\r\nRelates to #50065\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64751","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Antiforgery perf improvements (includes new DataProtection API usage)\" (#64751)"},{"Id":"3723345959","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-12T14:52:15","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"64746","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] (deps): Bump src/submodules/googletest from `1b96fa1` to `065127f`","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps [src/submodules/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) from `1b96fa1` to `065127f`.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/googletest/commit/065127f1e4b46c5f14fc73cf8d323c221f9dc68e\"><code>065127f</code></a> Add [[nodiscard]] throughput Google Test.</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/googletest/compare/1b96fa13f549387b7549cc89e1a785cf143a1a50...065127f1e4b46c5f14fc73cf8d323c221f9dc68e\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

It loads TempData from the HTTP context and ensures it is saved back to cookies on response.\r\n* Added `TempDataService` for serializing/deserializing TempData to/from cookies, handling supported types and data conversion.\r\n* Added end-to-end tests verifying that TempData can persist values across navigation.\r\n\r\nFixes #49683 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64749","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"TempData support for Blazor\" (#64749)"},{"Id":"3723347442","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-12T13:20:51","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"64747","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] (deps): Bump dotnet/arcade/.github/workflows/inter-branch-merge-base.yml from 1c09acb26525da819530dd2678a0b7f62c35cbfd to dd6311861abf91f883a5f6aa3b13ff095ed44179","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps [dotnet/arcade/.github/workflows/inter-branch-merge-base.yml](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade) from 1c09acb26525da819530dd2678a0b7f62c35cbfd to dd6311861abf91f883a5f6aa3b13ff095ed44179.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/dd6311861abf91f883a5f6aa3b13ff095ed44179\"><code>dd63118</code></a> Apply CDN URL substitution to asset locations stored in BAR (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/16392\">#16392</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/27e190e2a8053738859c082e2f70df62e01ff524\"><code>27e190e</code></a> Always pass -UseBasicParsing for Invoke-WebRequest calls in powershell (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/16396\">#16396</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/6a1790224da16b29585cd799b7fcd3d037432d01\"><code>6a17902</code></a> [main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/16393\">#16393</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/4917b993548eac98a7e6b1b2840bb19ac55bc8f9\"><code>4917b99</code></a> [main] Update dependencies from dotnet/xharness (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/16362\">#16362</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/17c915fe8e3094d636fb256f2c2860f38ea7b121\"><code>17c915f</code></a> Enable filtering for tests on coreclr interpreter (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/16385\">#16385</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/7438a998446e46b92807fe58ca5b3f5a5ecafd78\"><code>7438a99</code></a> Fix dotnet.exe path quoting in wix.targets (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/16381\">#16381</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/f890dfe3735571ec15d454fef0fcec4eea5ae554\"><code>f890dfe</code></a> Fix Arcade secret rotation in the daily pipeline (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/16384\">#16384</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/65e09c040143048211dcf6b2bd69336cbf27eec6\"><code>65e09c0</code></a> Only run source index for main builds (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/16377\">#16377</a>)</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/1c09acb26525da819530dd2678a0b7f62c35cbfd...dd6311861abf91f883a5f6aa3b13ff095ed44179\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

However, if the value in the ModelState cannot be parsed as a boolean, then ASP.NET Core throws a FormatException.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt is surprising that this can cause a FormatException to be thrown, since invalid user input is expected to be discarded when the model is initially bound. I would expect that if the input cannot be parsed, the checkbox is not set. If this is expected behaviour, guidance from the .NET team as to how a developer should handle this would be welcome.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRepo: https://github.com/waiwaing/aspnet-checkbox-exception\n\n1.

Services are enabled by default and can be disabled via the `System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Meter.IsSupported` feature switch for trimming scenarios.\n\n**Changes:**\n\n- Added `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics` reference to WebAssembly project (brought in transitively to test project)\n- Registered `ComponentsMetrics` and `ComponentsActivitySource` in `WebAssemblyHostBuilder.InitializeDefaultServices()` behind feature switch check\n- Services are enabled by default (opt-out) and can be disabled by setting the `System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Meter.IsSupported` AppContext switch to `false`\n- Added test coverage verifying `IMeterFactory` registration and documented that both metrics and tracing services are registered together\n\nThis enables consistent telemetry collection across Blazor hosting modes while supporting IL trimming for size-constrained scenarios through the feature switch mechanism.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>[Blazor] Register Components metric and tracing by default on webassembly host.</issue_title>\n> <issue_description></issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Look at how this is done in the components server render mode host.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

As well as [HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder) and [Introducing WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model) for migration guides.\n\nBelow is an example of converting `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder`:\n\n**Before**\n```csharp\nvar hostBuilder = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup()\n    .UseKestrel();\n// Test code might use TestServer:\nvar testServer = new TestServer(hostBuilder);\n```\n\n**After**\n```csharp\nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseTestServer() // If using TestServer\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\nawait host.StartAsync();\n\nvar testServer = host.GetTestServer();\n```\n\nBoth Copilot and ChatGpt have given good results so far when asked to convert a WebHostBuilder example to use HostBuilder.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

It can be set directly or by registering a provider in the Dependency Injection container.\r\n\r\n`TimeProvider` does not truncate to the nearest second, consumers are expected to correctly format the time as needed.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [X] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nUnifying the time abstraction across the stack for easier testing.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nComponents that derive from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SecurityStampValidator<TUser>` should remove their `ISystemClock` constructor parameter and call the new base constructor accordingly. Similarly, derived implementations that reference the `Clock` property on these types should reference the new `TimeProvider` property instead. `TimeProvider` is now settable for testing on the options or via DI.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder, ISystemClock clock)\r\n-        : base(options, logger, encoder, clock)\r\n+    public BasicAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder)\r\n+        : base(options, logger, encoder)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-       var currentUtc = Clock.UtcNow;\r\n+       var currentUtc = TimeProvider.GetUtcNow();\r\n```\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- [`ISystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.isystemclock)\r\n- [`SystemClock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.systemclock)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`AuthenticationHandler<TOptions>.Clock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.authenticationhandler-1.clock)\r\n- [`CookieAuthenticationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationhandler)\r\n- [`FacebookHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.facebook.facebookhandler)\r\n- [`GoogleHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.google.googlehandler)\r\n- [`JwtBearerHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.jwtbearerhandler)\r\n- [`MicrosoftAccountHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.microsoftaccount.microsoftaccounthandler)\r\n- [`NegotiateHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.negotiate.negotiatehandler)\r\n- [`OAuthHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.oauth.oauthhandler-1)\r\n- [`OpenIdConnectHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.openidconnect.openidconnecthandler)\r\n- [`PolicySchemeHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.policyschemehandler)\r\n- [`RemoteAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.remoteauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignInAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signinauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`SignOutAuthenticationHandler<TOptions>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.signoutauthenticationhandler-1)\r\n- [`TwitterHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.twitter.twitterhandler)\r\n- [`WsFederationHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.wsfederation.wsfederationhandler)\r\n- [`SecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.securitystampvalidator-1)\r\n- [`TwoFactorSecurityStampValidator<TUser>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.twofactorsecuritystampvalidator-1)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/505","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider\" (#505)"},{"Id":"1661290568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-10T20:06:20","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"504","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` no longer use custom converters","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nPrior to .NET 8 Preview 2, `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` type used custom converters to support JSON serialization due to a lack of support for the `IgnoreNullValues` option.

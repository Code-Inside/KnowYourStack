Investigation shows **the feature already works correctly**:\n\n- `Type.FullName` produces valid assembly-qualified names for closed generics (e.g., `GenericComponent`1[[System.Int32, System.Private.CoreLib, ...]]`)\n- `Assembly.GetType()` correctly resolves these names during deserialization\n\nThis PR adds comprehensive test coverage:\n\n**EndpointHtmlRendererTest (4 tests)**\n- Static rendering of `GenericComponent<int>`\n- Interactive Server mode (prerendered and non-prerendered)\n- Interactive WebAssembly mode (prerendered)\n\n**ServerComponentDeserializerTest (4 tests)**\n- Serialization/deserialization round-trip for closed generic types\n- Different type parameters (`int`, `string`)\n- Parameter handling with generic components\n\n```razor\n@* Example: GenericComponent.razor *@\n@typeparam TValue\n\n<p>Generic value: @(Value?.ToString() ?? \"(null)\")</p>\n@code {\n    [Parameter] public TValue Value { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nUsage in tests:\n```csharp\nvar result = await renderer.PrerenderComponentAsync(\n    httpContext, \n    typeof(GenericComponent<int>), \n    RenderMode.InteractiveServer, \n    ParameterView.FromDictionary(new Dictionary<string, object> { { \"Value\", 123 } }));\n```\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Support prerendering closed generic components</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!--\r\n> This template is useful to build consensus about whether work should be done, and if so, the high-level shape of how it should be approached. Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\r\n> -->\r\n> \r\n> ## Summary\r\n> \r\n> We don't support rendering generic components as root components due to limitations in the way we serialize the type definition for the component (a similar thing happens for component parameters). We should consider lifting this limitation to support some more advanced scenarios.\r\n> \r\n> ## Motivation and goals\r\n> \r\n> Turns out that rendering generic components is useful if you want to write a \"functional\" component to wrap around another component, an example of this is when you are rendering multiple components at different points on a page and you want to, for example, require authentication for those components.\r\n> \r\n> At that point, application developers are forced to write an individual wrapper for each of those components they want to wrap.\r\n> \r\n> ## In scope\r\n> \r\n> Support rendering closed generic components from Blazor applications.\r\n> \r\n> ## Out of scope\r\n> \r\n> TBD\r\n> \r\n> ## Risks / unknowns\r\n> \r\n> None so far\r\n> \r\n> ## Examples\r\n> \r\n> ```razor\r\n> <CascadingAuthenticationState>\r\n>     <AuthorizeView>\r\n>         <Authorized>\r\n>             <TComponent @attributes=\"Params\" />\r\n>         </Authorized>\r\n>     </AuthorizeView>\r\n> </CascadingAuthenticationState>\r\n> \r\n> @code{\r\n>     [Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)] public IDictionary<string,object> Params { get; set; }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Having a language syntax for writing these types of components is also desirable, otherwise it's cumbersome and likely error prone to author them:\r\n> ```csharp\r\n>     public class ProtectedWidget<T> : IComponent where T : IComponent\r\n>     {\r\n>         private RenderHandle _handle;\r\n>         private ParameterView _parameters;\r\n>         static RenderFragment _authorizeFragment;\r\n> \r\n>         public ProtectedWidget()\r\n>         {\r\n>             _authorizeFragment = new RenderFragment(AuthorizedFragment);\r\n>         }\r\n> \r\n>         public void Attach(RenderHandle renderHandle)\r\n>         {\r\n>             _handle = renderHandle;\r\n>         }\r\n> \r\n>         public Task SetParametersAsync(ParameterView parameters)\r\n>         {\r\n>             _parameters = parameters;\r\n>             _handle.Render(BuildRenderTree);\r\n> \r\n>             return Task.CompletedTask;\r\n>         }\r\n> \r\n>         private void BuildRenderTree(RenderTreeBuilder builder)\r\n>         {\r\n> \r\n>             builder.OpenComponent<CascadingAuthenticationState>(0);\r\n>             builder.OpenComponent<AuthorizeView>(1);\r\n>             builder.AddAttribute(1, \"Authorized\", _authorizeFragment);\r\n>             builder.CloseComponent();\r\n>             builder.CloseComponent();\r\n> \r\n>         }\r\n>         void AuthorizedFragment(RenderTreeBuilder child)\r\n>         {\r\n>             child.OpenComponent<T>(0);\r\n>             child.AddMultipleAttributes(1, _parameters.ToDictionary());\r\n>             child.CloseComponent();\r\n>         }\r\n>     }\r\n> ```\r\n> </issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> <comment_new><author>@</author><body>\n> Thanks for contacting us.\n> We're moving this issue to the `Next sprint planning` milestone for future evaluation / consideration.

with InteractiveAuto render mode","State":"open","Body":"# WebAssembly resource loading behavior with InteractiveAuto (no prerendering)\n\n**Describe the bug**  \nWhen using `InteractiveAuto` with prerendering disabled, the expected behavior is that if the WebAssembly resources are not yet downloaded, the app should run in `InteractiveServer` mode until the WASM payload is ready, and then seamlessly switch to client‑side execution.  \n\nOn first load this works partially: the user connects via server rendering over WebSockets while the WASM bundle is downloading. However, after the download completes, the app does **not** switch from server rendering to client rendering. The user must perform a full page reload before the WASM runtime is activated. This is problematic because a typical end user may never refresh the page, meaning the app remains stuck in server mode indefinitely.\n\n---\n\n**Additional problems**  \nEven after a manual refresh, the developer tools show a large number of requests for WASM resources. The page remains blank (The page remains blank because prerendering is disabled. The bigger problem is that even if the WASM bundle has already been downloaded, the transition from server rendering to client rendering still causes a very long pause, which is extremely frustrating.) until the last WASM request completes. This happens on **every** refresh.  \n\nFor testing, I hosted the app and observed the same behavior: each refresh triggers a full reload of all resources. Some requests return `304 Not Modified`, but there are still 100+ requests, which adds significant latency before WASM is initialized. Only after all requests finish does the app finally start running client‑side.\n\n---\n\n**Expected behavior**  \n- After WASM download completes, the app should automatically switch from server rendering to client rendering without requiring a full page reload (or the developer should somehow trigger the transition programmatically. ).  \n- Resource loading should be optimized to avoid redundant requests. Ideally, a checksum or GUID could be used to validate whether the client already has the correct build.

This forces developers to either:\r\n- Hardcode label text (violating DRY principles and making localization difficult)\r\n- Build custom reflection-based solutions\r\n- Duplicate display name information across models and views\r\n\r\nThe new `DisplayName<TValue>` component provides an attribute-based solution that follows the same familiar pattern as other Blazor form components like `ValidationMessage<TValue>`.\r\n\r\nFixes #49147\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n```c#\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms;\r\n\r\npublic class DisplayName<TValue> : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    [EditorRequired]\r\n    public Expression<Func<TValue>>?

This could create a pit of failure for customers who see examples in docs using the `blazor.web.js` options format but are writing a Blazor WebAssembly standalone app, for example.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe should update `blazor.webassembly.js` and `blazor.server.js` to accept the options format used by `blazor.web.js`.\nInclude end-to-end test that will assert that options are passed correctly\n\n**Summary Comment**: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51611#issuecomment-1866955885\n</issue_description>\n\n<agent_instructions>Follow the instructions in src/Components/Agents.md\n\nYou MUST follow this workflow when implementing new features or fixing bugs in the Components area.\n* Add the workflow to your `todos` and follow it strictly.\n- Create a sample scenario.\n- If working on a bug, use playwright to reproduce the behavior/problem first.\n- You MUST have reproduced the problem before attempting to fix it.\n- Research the problem area using the microsoft docs, existing code, git history, and logging on the sample project.\n- Implement the fix or feature in the sample project first.\n- Test the fix or feature interactively using Playwright.\n- Once the fix or feature is validated in the sample, implement E2E tests for it.\n  - When you create an E2E test. First execute it interactively with Playwright.\n  - If an E2E test is failing, debug it by running the test server manually and navigating to the scenario in a browser.\n- Only after the E2E tests are passing, remove the sample code you added in the Samples projects.\n\nIn this case, for the E2E tests you can probably modify one of the `App.razor` files in the testassets that use blazor.web.js and take parameters to use the new format. Make sure that there is at least one file that uses the new format and one that uses the old format.</agent_instructions>\n\n## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n\n<comments>\n<comment_new><author>@</author><body>\nThanks for contacting us.\n\nWe're moving this issue to the `.NET 9 Planning` milestone for future evaluation / consideration.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

As well as [HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder) and [Introducing WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model) for migration guides.\n\nBelow is an example of converting `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder`:\n\n**Before**\n```csharp\nvar hostBuilder = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup()\n    .UseKestrel();\n// Test code might use TestServer:\nvar testServer = new TestServer(hostBuilder);\n```\n\n**After**\n```csharp\nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseTestServer() // If using TestServer\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\nawait host.StartAsync();\n\nvar testServer = host.GetTestServer();\n```\n\nBoth Copilot and ChatGpt have given good results so far when asked to convert a WebHostBuilder example to use HostBuilder.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Or authentication to fail if using TLS termination and expecting an https request.\n\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nThe change was made for security hardening, as the proxy and IP lists weren't being applied in all cases.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n- **Review your deployment topology:**  \n  Ensure that all legitimate proxy servers in front of your app are properly added to `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` in your `ForwardedHeadersOptions` configuration.\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownProxies = { IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_PROXY_IP\") }\n  });\n  ```\n  Or, for a network:\n  ```csharp\n  app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n  {\n      KnownNetworks = { new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse(\"YOUR_NETWORK_IP\"), PREFIX_LENGTH) }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **If you wish to enable previous behavior:**  \n  You may need to relax your configuration, but this is **not recommended** due to security risks. You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

Please add all the required services by calling 'IServiceCollection.AddRateLimiter' in the application startup code.\r\n\r\n### Type of breaking change\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [X] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nRate limiting middleware requires services that are only registered by calling `AddRateLimiter`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure `AddRateLimiter()` is called at application startup.\r\n\r\nFor example, update `Configure<RateLimiterOptions>(o => { })` to use `AddRateLimiter()`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddRateLimiter(o => o\r\n    .AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: \"fixed\", options =>\r\n    {\r\n        // configuration\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UseRateLimiter();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => Results.Ok($\"Hello world\")).RequireRateLimiting(\"fixed\");\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[UseRateLimiter()](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.ratelimiterapplicationbuilderextensions.useratelimiter)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ASP.NET Core rate limiting middleware now requires AddRateLimiter\" (#506)"},{"Id":"1685250868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-26T15:26:43","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: ISystemClock obsolete and replaced by TimeProvider","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ISystemClock` has been used by the authentication and identity components since AspNetCore 1.0 to enable unit testing of time related functionality like expiration checking. .NET 8 now includes a suitable abstraction `System.TimeProvider` that provides the same functionality and much more.

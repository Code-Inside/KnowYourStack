This instrumentation library enriches activities by subscribing to DiagnosticSource events generated by ASP.NET Core.

Determine how custom propagators should be handled in this context.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/52439","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[.NET 9.0] Native Trace Instrumentation Support for ASP.NET Core as per OTel specification\" (#52439)"},{"Id":"2015649576","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-29T01:56:32","Actor":"runceel","Number":"52438","RawContent":null,"Title":"`InvalidOperationException` occurs on `onsubmit` event when using `NavigateTo` method with non-ASCII characters on Blazor SSR render mode.","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n`InvalidOperationException` occurs on `onsubmit` event when using `NavigateTo` method with non-ASCII characters on Blazor SSR render mode.

String.Empty;\r\n        googleOptions.ClientSecret = builder.Configuration[\"SwaggerGoogleOauth:Secret\"] ?? String.Empty;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Add the swagger config:\r\n```\r\nbuilder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(o =>\r\n{\r\n    o.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\", new Microsoft.OpenApi.Models.OpenApiInfo { Title = \"testAPI\", Version = \"v1\" });\r\n    o.AddSecurityDefinition(\"oauth2\", new Microsoft.OpenApi.Models.OpenApiSecurityScheme\r\n    {\r\n        Description = \"Oauth 2 with Authcode flow\",\r\n        Name = \"oauth2.0\",\r\n        Type = Microsoft.OpenApi.Models.SecuritySchemeType.OAuth2,\r\n        Flows = new()\r\n        {\r\n            AuthorizationCode = new Microsoft.OpenApi.Models.OpenApiOAuthFlow\r\n            {\r\n                AuthorizationUrl = new Uri(builder.Configuration[\"SwaggerGoogleOauth:AuthorizationUrl\"] ?? string.Empty),\r\n                TokenUrl = new Uri(builder.Configuration[\"SwaggerGoogleOauth:TokenUrl\"] ?? string.Empty),\r\n                Scopes = new Dictionary<string, string>\r\n                {\r\n                    { \"profile\", \"Access user profile\" },\r\n                    { \"email\", \"Access user email\" },\r\n                    // Add additional scopes as needed for your API access\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    o.AddSecurityRequirement(new Microsoft.OpenApi.Models.OpenApiSecurityRequirement\r\n    {\r\n        {\r\n            new OpenApiSecurityScheme\r\n            {\r\n                Reference = new OpenApiReference{Type=ReferenceType.SecurityScheme, Id=\"oauth2\"},\r\n                Type = SecuritySchemeType.OAuth2\r\n            },\r\n            new[]{ builder.Configuration[\"SwaggerGoogleOauth:Scopes\"] }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n5. add swagger UI section:\r\n```\r\n app.UseSwaggerUI(o =>\r\n {\r\n     o.OAuthClientId(builder.Configuration[\"SwaggerGoogleOauth:ClientId\"]);\r\n     o.OAuthClientSecret(builder.Configuration[\"SwaggerGoogleOauth:Secret\"]);\r\n     o.OAuthUsePkce();\r\n });\r\n```\r\n6. Slap an [Authorize] decorator on the weather controller\r\n6. Fire up the application. \r\n7. Click \"Authorize\" button in swagger. you should be able to select scopes and login successfully against your google project you created. Great!\r\n8. Now execute against the weather controller and you'll get the following back: `Failed to fetch.Possible Reasons:CORS Network Failure URL scheme must be \"http\" or \"https\" for CORS request.`\r\n9. remove authorize attribute and retry, request works without any issue. \r\n10. validate the request to the web api shown in swagger is including bearer token:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X 'GET' \\\r\n  'https://localhost:7281/WeatherForecast' \\\r\n  -H 'accept: text/plain' \\\r\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ya29.....g0170'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nStack overflow info from the \"another fun thing\" below:\r\n```\r\n.MoveNext()\r\n\r\n   at

This is useful when configuring multiple routes from configuration such as is the case for YARP. See https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy/pull/2328\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nIt would be preferred to something similar to

modified base path and using a reverse proxy","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n1. Blazor webassembly application (without any blazor server side component) does not load the browser when base path is modified and reverse proxy is used.\r\n2. However it does load properly in the browser when only base path is modified but reverse proxy is NOT used.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe browser should have displayed the blazor home page when using the reverse proxy and when base path is modified, just as it did when using the localhost and the port number when only the base path is modified but reverse proxy is not used.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1) Created a project with Blazor WebAssembly Standalone App template in VS 2022 (Version 17.8.1)\r\n\r\n2) Based on the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio#configure-the-app-base-path, I made following changes\r\n\r\n3) Navigated to **wwwroot/index.html** file and modified the <base> tag from:\r\n   \r\n   `<base href=\"/\" />`\r\n   \r\n   to\r\n   \r\n   `<base href=\"/foo/\" />`\r\n   \r\n4) Navigated to **Properties/launchSettings.json** changed the https element under profiles from\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"https\": {\r\n      ...\r\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:7269;http://localhost:5297\",\r\n      \"inspectUri\": \"{wsProtocol}://{url.hostname}:{url.port}/_framework/debug/ws-proxy?browser={browserInspectUri}\"\r\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\r\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n    \r\n    to\r\n    \r\n```\r\n    \"https\": {\r\n      ...\r\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:7269;http://localhost:5297\",\r\n      \"inspectUri\": \"{wsProtocol}://{url.hostname}:{url.port}/foo/_framework/debug/ws-proxy?browser={browserInspectUri}\",\r\n      \"commandLineArgs\": \"--pathbase=/foo\",\r\n      \"launchUrl\": \"https://localhost:7269/foo\",\r\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\r\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n5) Note the changes or additions to launchUrl, commandLineArgs and inspectUri properties.\r\n\r\n6) The change to inspectUri property was not discussed in the above article but I figured it out based on the exception.\r\n\r\n7) When I ran the project in VS, browser opened with \"https://localhost:7269/foo\" in the address bar and the web page renders the blazor UI as expected.\r\n\r\n8) Now to the hard part, I used a reverse proxy (namely Caddy server) to replace the host name from \"localhost:7269\" to \"www.example.local\" after mapping the latter to the 127.0.0.1 in the host file (on windows machine) and entered \"https://www.example.local/foo\" in a new tab.\r\n\r\n9) At first, all blazor files seemed to be loading in the browser until dynamic module request (based on the browser dev tools/network option) was issued by https://www.example.local/foo/_framework/dotnet.runtime.8.0.0.14kkjimq5k.js for blazor-hotreload.js file with the path https://www.example.local/_framework/blazor-hotreload.js. Note that the file path for blazor-hotreload.js **did not include** the \"/foo\" in it while the referer file (i.e. dotnet.runtime.8.0.0.14kkjimq5k.js) **includes** \"/foo\" in it.\r\n\r\n10) Needless the browser showed \"An unhandled error has occurred\" with Reload link to reload it again. Clicking on reload button did not solve the issue.\r\n\r\n11) Meanwhile the web assembly project in the VS debugger showed following exception (confirming the above error assessment):\r\n\r\n12) Another odd thing is that the request for https://www.example.local/_framework/blazor-hotreload.js results in status code 200 while the exception is shown on the server side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nServer side exception is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: One or more errors occurred.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT. These JwtSecurityToken were produced by [SecurityTokenValidators](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.isecuritytokenvalidator?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\nFrom ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, by default the class derived from SecurityToken implenting these properties is JSonWebToken which are produced by more optimized [TokenHandlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.tokenhandler?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\n\r\n## Type of breaking change\r\n- [ ] Binary incompatible: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\r\n- [ ] Source incompatible: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\r\n- [x] Behavioral change: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\nThis change was made because JSonWebToken (and its associated JSonWebTokenHandler) are bringing:\r\n- 30% performance improvement.\r\n- Improved reliability by the usage of a Last Known Good metadata (such as the OpenIdConnectMetadata)\r\n- async processing\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\nFor most of you, this shouldn't be a problem as the type of the properties (SecurityToken) has not changed, and you were not supposed to look at the real type.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were downcasting one of these SecurityToken properties to JwtSecurityToken (for example to get the claims), you will now need to:\r\n- either down-cast them to JSonWebToken\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // Replace your cast to JwtSecurityToken.\r\n          JSonWebToken token = context.SecurityToken as JSonWebToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- or set one of the UseSecurityTokenValidators boolean properties on the corresponding options (JtwBearerOptions, WsFederationOptions, OpenIdConnectOptions) to true, in which case the authentication handlers will keep using the JwtTokenValidators and will keep producing JwtSecurityTokens.\r\n\r\n  ```CSharp\r\n  service.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,  options => {\r\n      options.UseSecurityTokenValidators = true;\r\n      options.Events.TokenValidated = (context) => {\r\n          // As you were doing before\r\n          JwtSecurityToken token = context.SecurityToken as JwtSecurityToken;\r\n          // Do something ...\r\n      };\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\nThe properties that are concerned are the following:\r\n\r\n### In WsFederationEvents\r\n\r\n- [SecurityTokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/WsFederation/src/SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs#L31)\r\n\r\n### In JwtBearerEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/JwtBearer/src/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L27)\r\n\r\n### In OpenIdConnectEvents\r\n\r\n- [TokenValidatedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/TokenValidatedContext.cs#L32)\r\n- [AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.SecurityToken](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/ef07bcb02ae3d7218dbd3dd0358974b2b7e9ddd2/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/Events/AuthorizationCodeReceivedContext.cs#L34)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: JwtBearer, WsFederation, and OpenIdConnect events context properties of type SecurityToken now return a JSonWebToken by default\" (#508)"},{"Id":"1805550224","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:44:25","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: TrimMode defaults to `full` for WebSDK projects","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nTrimming now trims all assemblies in applications targeting the Web SDK, by default.

A previously specified `BindingInfo.BindingSource` is never overwritten.\r\n2. A complex type parameter, registered in the DI container, is assigned `BindingSource.Services`.\r\n3. A complex type parameter, not registered in the DI container, is assigned `BindingSource.Body`.\r\n4. Parameter with a name that appears as a route value in ANY route template is assigned `BindingSource.Path`.\r\n5.

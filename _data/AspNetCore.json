I have double checked my boundary checking and enforcement multiple times and found them working exactly as expected.\n\n> Exactly the same issue that Dwipraj was having, I had. When clicking the slider the first time, above the \"expected upper bound\", the slider's value would be capped as expected. But when clicking it a second time, the value would exceed the boundary.\n\nWhen it was not working, I had been running\n```\n<input type=\"range\"\n  @bind-value=\"MyValue\"\n  @oninput=\"(args) => ProcessChangeInMyValue(args)\"\n/>\n```\n\nHowever, I resolved the \"value gets set too low/high\" issue that Dwipraj was encountering by instead explicitly specifying\n```\n<input type=\"range\"\n  @bind-value:get=\"MyValue\"\n  @bind-value:set=\"(value) => ProcessChangeInMyValue(args)\" @* <= This was missing before *@\n  @oninput=\"(args) => ProcessChangeInMyValue(args)\"\n/>\n```\n\nThe problem here is that there is _no warning or error provided_ that makes it clear to an amateur user (like myself) that specifying only `@bind-value` and `@oninput` on the `input` has the counterintuitive behavior that `@bind-value:set` is also implicitly defined, and as such sometimes clobbers the intended (by the amateur user) result of `@oninput`.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- [ ] **1:** Either such a user case should result in a warning or error shown to the programmer,\nOR\n- [ ] **2:** `@oninput` should be given priority over the implicit `@bind-value:set`, such that whatever the programmer explicitly specifies is what takes place.\n\nWhichever of these techniques is employed, it should be consistent across input types.\n\n**P.S.** Concerning suggested solution 1:\nWhen the programmer tries to compile the following,\n```\n<input type=\"range\"\n  @bind-value=\"MyValue\"\n  @onchange=\"(args) => ProcessChangeInMyValue(args)\"\n/>\n```\nThe compiler throws error `RZ10008`, which goes on to explicitly state \"_... The attribute 'onchange' is used by the '@bind-value' directive attribute._\"\n\nThis is a good thing - thank you for doing it in that case! - **a similar technique** ought to be employed for the `@bind-value` and `@oninput` combination, if `@bind-value` is to continue to sometimes overrule the result of `@oninput`.\nThis way, scenarios like these can be taught to lesser experienced developers through the platform, lessening that part of learning which is unnecessarily frustrating, and so that future developers do not waste hours of their time trying to debug what can be stated in a sentence from the framework itself.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n**Repro repo here**. Just download, run in Visual Studio, and run, and the showcase will appear.\nhttps://github.com/josephvanderharst/value-and-oninput-issue-repro\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.306\n\n### Anything else?\n\nVisual Studio 2022, Community edition.

I had a poorly written issue (#64807, now closed) that tried to detail my attempts with .Net 10 RC2. I believe the issues here are apart from the Mono assertion errors that are to be fixed in RTM.\n\nThe intent is to create a Blazor custom element that is hosted on a Vite website (so pretty much a javascript website).\n\nHere are the issues encountered:\n\n1. It appears that the generated blazor.webassembly.{version}.js has a hardcoded reference to dotnet.js (Observed in RC1 & RC2)\n2. The publish output using RC2 is truncated.\n3.

It introduces a runtime check that throws an exception if an async method is invoked synchronously. The changes also add a targeted unit test to verify this behavior.\r\n* Added a check in `DotNetDispatcher.InvokeSynchronously` to throw an `InvalidOperationException` if an async method is invoked synchronously, guiding users to use `BeginInvokeDotNet` for async methods.\r\n* Introduced the helper method `IsAsyncMethod` using the `AsyncStateMachineAttribute` to reliably detect async methods.\r\n* Updated method signatures and call sites to pass an `isAsyncContext` flag, distinguishing between sync and async invocation contexts. This is needed because InvokeSynchronously is used by both sync and async version.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Use HostBuilder or WebApplicationBuilder instead. For more information, visit https://aka.ms/aspnet/deprecate/008.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [x] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [ ] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nWe recommend the use of `HostBuilder` and `WebApplication` going forward over `WebHostBuilder` because they have all the features of `WebHostBuilder` and will be the focus of future investment.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nSee https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host or https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/webapplication for more details on the different hosting models. As well as [HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder) and [Introducing WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model) for migration guides.\n\nBelow is an example of converting `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder`:\n\n**Before**\n```csharp\nvar hostBuilder = new WebHostBuilder()\n    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .UseStartup()\n    .UseKestrel();\n// Test code might use TestServer:\nvar testServer = new TestServer(hostBuilder);\n```\n\n**After**\n```csharp\nusing var host = new HostBuilder()\n    .ConfigureWebHost(webHostBuilder =>\n    {\n        webHostBuilder\n            .UseTestServer() // If using TestServer\n            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n            .UseStartup()\n            .UseKestrel();\n    })\n    .Build();\nawait host.StartAsync();\n\nvar testServer = host.GetTestServer();\n```\n\nBoth Copilot and ChatGpt have given good results so far when asked to convert a WebHostBuilder example to use HostBuilder.

This is particularly useful for large apps or frameworks (like UmbracoCMS) that need a quick mitigation.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe cookie authentication handler would redirect unauthenticated and unauthorized requests to a login or access denied URI by default for all requests other than [XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### New behavior\n\nUnauthenticated and unauthorized requests made to known API endpoints will result in 401 and 403 responses rather than redirecting to a login or access denied URI. XHRs continue to result in 401 and 403 responses regardless of the target endpoint.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/9039 was highly requested, and redirecting unauthenticated requests to a login page doesn't usually make sense for API endpoints which typically rely on 401 and 403 status codes rather than HTML redirects to communicate auth failures.\n\n### Recommended action\n\n#### To always redirect (fully disable new behavior):\n\n**Recommended for frameworks/applications needing an immediate opt-out or full legacy compatibility:**\n\nSet the following AppContext switch (e.g., in your app's runtimeconfig.json or programmatically at startup):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"configProperties\": {\n      \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nOr, set programmatically before building the host:\n```csharp\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.IgnoreRedirectMetadata\", true);\n```\n\n#### To allow redirects on specific endpoints:\n\nApply the `[AllowCookieRedirect]` attribute to controllers or endpoints that should preserve cookie-based redirects, or implement the `IAllowCookieRedirectMetadata` interface.\n\n```csharp\n[AllowCookieRedirect]\npublic class MyLegacyApiController : Controller { ... }\n```\n\n#### To revert to the exact previous handler logic (redirect except for XHRs):\n\nYou can override the events with the following logic:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        bool IsXhr(HttpRequest request)\n        {\n            return string.Equals(request.Query[HeaderNames.XRequestedWith], \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal) ||\n                string.Equals(request.Headers.XRequestedWith, \"XMLHttpRequest\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n        }\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            if (IsXhr(context.Request))\n            {\n                context.Response.Headers.Location = context.RedirectUri;\n                context.Response.StatusCode = 403;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            }\n\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n#### To always redirect regardless of endpoint type or XHR:\n\nOverride the events to always redirect:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication()\n    .AddCookie(options =>\n    {\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToLogin = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n\n        options.Events.OnRedirectToAccessDenied = context =>\n        {\n            context.Response.Redirect(context.RedirectUri);\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        };\n    });\n```\n\n###

when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nThe [ASP.NET Core exception handler middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#exception-handler-page), `UseExceptionHandler()`, is responsible for catching and processing unhandled exceptions from ASP.NET Core requests.\n\nIn .NET 8, we introduced [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#iexceptionhandler). Implementations of `IExceptionHandler` are registered with dependency injection and invoked by the middleware. An implementation can return `true` from `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` to indicate that the exception has been handled. The middleware stops processing the exception once it has been handled.\n\nIn .NET 10, we're changing the default behavior so that the middleware no longer records diagnostics for exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nThe exception handler middleware recorded diagnostics about exceptions handled by `IExceptionHandler`.\n\nThe exception diagnostics are:\n\n- Logging `UnhandledException` to `ILogger`.\n- Writing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HandledException` event to `EventSource`.\n- Adding the `error.type` tag to the `http.server.request.duration` metric.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIf `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns `true`, then exception diagnostics are no longer recorded by default.\n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [ ] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.\n- [x] **Behavioral change**: Existing binaries may behave differently at run time.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nASP.NET Core users have given feedback that the previous behavior was undesirable. Their `IExceptionHandler` implementation reported that the exception was handled, but the error handling middleware still recorded the error in the app's telemetry.\n\nWe are changing ASP.NET Core to follow the behavior expected by users by suppressing diagnostics when `IExceptionHandler` handles the exception. We're also adding configuration options to customize exception diagnostics behavior if needed.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf you want handled exceptions to continue recording telemetry, you can use the new `ExceptionHandlerOptions.SuppressDiagnosticsCallback` option:\n\n```cs\napp.UseExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandlerOptions\n{\n    SuppressDiagnosticsCallback = context => false;\n});\n```\n\nThe context passed to the callback includes information about the exception, the request, and whether the exception was handled. Returning `false` from the callback indicates that diagnostics shouldn't be suppressed. This restores the previous behavior.\n\n### References\n\n- Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54554\n- PR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/59074\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `UseExceptionHandler()`\n- `IExceptionHandler`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: Exception diagnostics are suppressed when `IExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync` returns true\" (#524)"},{"Id":"3261192807","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T20:43:37","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"523","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Obsolete IPNetwork and ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nReplacing `IPNetwork` with `System.Net.IPNetwork`.\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 10 Preview 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\n```csharp\napp.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions\n{\n    KnownNetworks.Add(new(IPAddress.Loopback, 8))\n});\n```\n\n### New behavior\n\nUsing the APIs listed below will produce a compiler warning with diagnostic ID ASPDEPR005:\n> warning ASPDEPR005: Please use KnownIPNetworks instead.

These analyzers provided compile-time validation to catch mismatches between declared return types and the actual types returned by controller actions.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Minimal APIs and the `TypedResults` pattern, the .NET ecosystem has evolved toward a more type-safe approach for API development. `TypedResults` provides compile-time guarantees about response types without requiring additional analyzers, making the MVC API analyzers redundant for modern .NET applications. In .NET 10, `TypedResults` are supported in controller-based APIs.\n\n**Previous approach with MVC API analyzers:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\n[ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(404)]\npublic async Task<ActionResult> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    if (product == null)\n        return NotFound(); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType(404)\n    \n    return Ok(product); // Analyzer ensures this matches ProducesResponseType<Product>(200)\n}\n```\n\n**Or with controller actions using TypedResults:**\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic async Task<Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>> GetProduct(int id)\n{\n    var product = await _productService.GetByIdAsync(id);\n    return product == null \n        ? TypedResults.NotFound() \n        : TypedResults.Ok(product);\n}\n```\n\nThe `TypedResults` pattern eliminates the need for separate analyzers because the return type itself (`Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>`) explicitly declares all possible response types at compile time. This approach is more maintainable, provides better IntelliSense support, and automatically generates accurate OpenAPI documentation without additional tooling.\n\nAs the .NET ecosystem continues to embrace `TypedResults` as the recommended pattern for API development, the MVC API analyzers have become obsolete and are being deprecated to streamline the development experience.\n\n## Recommended action\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n1. **Remove the deprecated property**: Remove `<IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>true</IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers>` from your project files to eliminate the warning.\n\n2. **Suppress the warning temporarily**: If you need to continue using the deprecated analyzers temporarily, you can suppress the warning:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPDEPR007</NoWarn>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n3. **Migrate to TypedResults**: Migrate to the `TypedResults` pattern documented above to ensure better consistency between application behavior and OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Affected APIs\n\n- MSBuild property: `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers`\n- Associated MVC API analyzers included when `IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers` is `true`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: IncludeOpenAPIAnalyzers property and MVC API analyzers are deprecated\" (#521)"},{"Id":"3244334287","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-18T20:43:18","Actor":"captainsafia","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Deprecation of IActionContextAccessor","State":"open","Body":"# Description\n\n`IActionContextAccessor` and `ActionContextAccessor` have been marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core with diagnostic ID `ASPDEPR006`.

Headers from unknown sources will be ignored.\n\n**This is a breaking change**: If your deployment relied on forwarded headers from proxies not configured in your application's trusted proxy list, those headers will no longer be honored.\n\nThis can cause behavior like infinite redirects if you're using the Https redirection middleware and using TLS termination in your proxy.

You can do this by clearing the `KnownNetworks` and `KnownProxies` lists in `ForwardedHeadersOptions` to allow any proxy or network to forward these headers.\n\nYou can also set the `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to true, which clears the lists and enables `ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto`.\n\nFor applications targeting .NET 9.0 or less, you can set the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.IgnoreUnknownProxiesWithoutFor` [AppContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext) switch to `\"true\"` or `1` to get back to the previous behavior.

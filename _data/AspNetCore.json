The generated `RenderTreeBuilder.AddAttribute(...)` call to set the parameter value will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// ...\r\n__builder.AddAttribute(1, \"Foo\", _foo); // '_foo' is of type 'Foo' here\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe want the `AddAttribute(int sequence, string name, object? value)` overload to be resolved, but since `Foo` defines an implicit conversion to `string`, the `AddAttribute(int sequence, string name, string value)` overload gets resolved instead. As a result, the framework later tries to set the component parameter of type `Foo` to a value of type `string`, and an exception is thrown. \r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, this PR adds an `AddComponentParameter(int sequence, string name, object? value)` method to `RenderTreeBuilder`. There is only one overload to choose from, so we don't experience the same problem as we did with `AddAttribute()`. Also, since component parameter values always get boxed eventually (to be added to a `RenderTreeFrame`), we're not losing anything by performing the boxing earlier.\r\n\r\nA corresponding change will have to be made in the Razor compiler so that generated code makes use of the new `AddComponentParameter()` method.\r\n\r\n## Validation\r\n\r\n- [X] Manual\r\n- [X] Automated tests\r\n\r\nContributes to #18042\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46562","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Introduce 'RenderTreeBuilder.AddComponentParameter()'\" (#46562)"},{"Id":"1578704507","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-09T22:27:56","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"46561","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/efcore dotnet/runtime","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:8ce5251e-8269-419d-3b2a-08d8b8050dda)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/efcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 8ce5251e-8269-419d-3b2a-08d8b8050dda\r\n- **Build**: 20230207.16\r\n- **Date Produced**: February 8, 2023 1:29:51 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 8664081d66b622447153f0b62fcaa0759d48ff26\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Please describe the problem.\n\nI am honestly shocked that I have searched everywhere and tried everything but still not able to accomplish this basic behavior.\r\nAm I missing something or is **Identity** missing a basic behavior?\r\n\r\nLet me explain it:\r\n\r\nMy application is a **Blazor Server** project where I have added **Identity** following the steps mentioned [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/scaffold-identity?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio#scaffold-identity-into-a-blazor-server-project).\r\n\r\nNow this is what I want to achieve:\r\n1. User enters their credentials.\r\n2. If the username is valid (in our Active Directory), I retrieve a field known as `EmployeeId` from the Active Directory.\r\n3. Authenticate the user using `SignInManager.PasswordSignInAsync`.\r\n4. Add `EmployeeId` that I retrieved in Step 2 as a claim to the ClaimsPrincipal. (So that I can use `EmployeeId` from Razor Components [like this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/?view=aspnetcore-7.0#expose-the-authentication-state-as-a-cascading-parameter)).\r\n\r\nMy `OnPostAsync` method in `Login.cshtml.cs` looks like this:\r\n\r\n    public class LoginModel : PageModel\r\n    {\r\n    \tprivate readonly SignInManager<MMTUser> _signInManager;\r\n    \tprivate readonly ILogger<LoginModel> _logger;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic LoginModel(SignInManager<MMTUser> signInManager, ILogger<LoginModel> logger)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t_signInManager = signInManager;\r\n    \t\t_logger = logger;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t// Other Properties, methods etc. here.\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic async Task<IActionResult> OnPostAsync(string returnUrl = null)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\treturnUrl ??= Url.Content(\"~/\");\r\n    \r\n    \t\tif (ModelState.IsValid)\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t// Step 1: Check if this user exists in our AD\r\n    \t\t\t// If YES: Grab the Employee Id and go to next step\r\n    \t\t\t// If NO: Terminate the process\r\n    \t\t\tvar adLookupResult = ADHelper.ADLookup(Input.Username);\r\n    \t\t\tif (adLookupResult == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(adLookupResult.EmployeeId))\r\n    \t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\tModelState.AddModelError(string.Empty, \"Invalid login attempt.\");\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn Page();\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t// Step 2: SignIn the user\r\n    \t\t\tvar result = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(Input.Username, Input.Password, isPersistent: Input.RememberMe, lockoutOnFailure: false);\r\n\r\n                // Step 3: How do I add adLookupResult.EmployeeId to the ClaimsPrincipal?\r\n\r\n    \t\t\tif (result.Succeeded)\r\n    \t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\t_logger.LogInformation(\"User logged in.\");\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn LocalRedirect(returnUrl);\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\telse\r\n    \t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\tModelState.AddModelError(string.Empty, \"Invalid login attempt.\");\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn Page();\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\t// If we got this far, something failed, redisplay form\r\n    \t\treturn Page();\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI tried to use _ClaimsTransformer_ as documented [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/claims?view=aspnetcore-7.0#extend-or-add-custom-claims-using-iclaimstransformation) but since I cannot pass my `adLookupResult.EmployeeId` to `TransformAsync` method, I can't really use that approach.\r\n\r\nI tried adding it using:\r\n`HttpContext.User.AddIdentity(new ClaimsIdentity(new List<Claim> { new Claim(\"NewClaim\", \"EmployeeIdFromStep2\") }));`\r\nright after successful sign in, but that doesn't work.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nEither provide a way to pass claims value to the `public Task<ClaimsPrincipal> TransformAsync(ClaimsPrincipal principal)` method or provide a method to add claims during Login while using **Identity**.\n\n### Additional context\n\nFull source code:\r\n---\r\nhttps://github.com/affableashish/blazor-server-auth/tree/feature/AddClaimsDuringLogin\r\n\r\nAdded Claims during Login (in [Login.cshtml.cs](https://github.com/affableashish/blazor-server-auth/blob/bab11ae89e3e3f1120b523f8688ca91c3ff71dff/src/HMT.Web.Server/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Login.cshtml.cs#L121) file) and accessed those claims from [Razor Component](https://github.com/affableashish/blazor-server-auth/blob/bab11ae89e3e3f1120b523f8688ca91c3ff71dff/src/HMT.Web.Server/Areas/Identity/Components/TakeABreak.razor#L17).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it didn't work. I only get `null` as the claim value. 😔","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/46558","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Claims to a user during login while using Identity\"

Team,\r\n\r\nWe want to use Blazor Appliation for our website, and want to leverage the reusable components features. But we don't want to make the site stateful as we cannot enable the ARR affinity and Websocket for our hosting app service which is the mandatory requirements for publishing a blazor application to azure app service. \r\n\r\n**Referenced  Links:** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/server?view=aspnetcore-3.1\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/publish-to-azure-web-app?view=aspnetcore-3.1\r\n\r\nWe don't have the SPA requirement and the controls interaction (like click event, onchange event etc.), we will handle through javascript code only. \r\n\r\nThe main feature that we would like to use, is the Reusable components (.razor components). We have explored different ways to use the .razor(Blazor) components in a normal .Net core/MVC app, there are many options but they don't seem to be worked in a fully reusable manner e.g. we won't be able to use the nested components etc.\r\n\r\nThe only option we can think of is: We  create a Blazor server app and remove the reference of the \"**_framework/blazor.server.js**\" JS  as that JS is what makes the blazer components interactive and also create the signalR connection. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking some guidance if we can go with this approach, will there be any downsides of removing the \"**_framework/blazor.server.js**\" JS reference?

Please describe the problem.\n\nI was very excited to see that with .NET 7 Blazor team has introduced download progress. Bundle size is known limitation of Blazor client, nice and informative progress bar is essential for any serious web app to mitigate this problem. To achieve this essential goal our team has to use custom loader. DIY solutions in such sensitive area are quite dangerous - each error or bug in this area means potentially lost customer. Therefore we were about to drop our custom loader with new .NET but soon realised that blazor progress shows completely bogus data.\r\nI don't know how Blazor computes total progress but here's what we encountered with:\r\nTotal AOT bundle size is 137 Mb (which is much, but we can put up with) dotnet.wasm occupying the largest part of that:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 11 05 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3992180/217791641-819de078-5bcf-4740-a6ed-b2665c869500.png)\r\nSo, real download progress is 19%, whereas here's what Blazor shows:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 11 09 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3992180/217792641-b67d5672-25f7-4ef9-bd1e-d1c1f4350fb5.png)\r\n\r\nIt got stuck at 98% for the rest of 100Mb of download. Such user experience is even worse than indefinite spinner because it misleading that application is frozen and nothing happens at all. At current state I find this feature useless or even harmful.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nBundle download state should be explicitly exposed.

The reason for this is that including regular expression support on constraints pulls in about 800K of extra file size. We still include the regex constraint resolver when ```CreateBuilder(...)``` is used.\r\n\r\nHowever ... there is an opportunity for people to continue to use regular expressions for router parameters if they implement their own route constraints and provided they know what the regular expression is in advance they can take advantage of source generated regular expressions. We want an analyzer which detects the use of regex constraints and adds a warning which links to documentation on how to create a custom route constraint that uses source generated regex.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Analyzer\r\n\r\n### Analyzer Behavior and Message\r\n\r\nWhen a route pattern is used that includes a regex constraint, we would output the following info message:\r\n\r\n> INFO: Recommend use of custom reoute constraint with source generated regular expressions. See https://aka.ms/aspet/tba for more details.\r\n\r\nNote, if we detect that we are using CreateSlimBuilder (won't always be possible) then we can increase this to a warning?\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\n- [ ] Design\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ] Globalization\r\n- [ ] Interoperability\r\n- [ ] Maintainability\r\n- [ ] Naming\r\n- [ ] Performance\r\n- [ ] Reliability\r\n- [ ] Security\r\n- [ ] Style\r\n- [x] Usage\r\n\r\n### Severity Level\r\n\r\n- [ ] Error\r\n- [ ] Warning\r\n- [x] Info\r\n- [ ] Hidden\r\n\r\n## Usage Scenarios\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\napp.MapGet(\"/products/{productId:regex(...)}\", (string productId) => {});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nTo discuss.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/46546","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Warning on use of regex constraints in route parameters.\" (#46546)"},{"Id":"1577370706","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-09T07:16:27","Actor":"mitchdenny","Number":"46545","RawContent":null,"Title":"First pass at basic query string parameters.","State":"open","Body":"# First pass at basic string binding for request delegate source generator\r\n\r\nThis PR gets the basics of binding strings to the source generated request delegate.

These have all been annotated as unsafe.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic static partial class Results\r\n{\r\n    [RequiresUnreferencedCode(RouteValueDictionaryTrimmerWarning.Warning)]\r\n    public static IResult CreatedAtRoute(string? routeName = null, object? routeValues = null, object? value = null);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have previously worked around this problem by adding overloads that take `RouteValueDictionary`. Values can be explicitly added to the dictionary, and the dictionary is then passed to routing. This is a trimming and AOT-safe alternative.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;\r\n\r\npublic static partial class Results\r\n{\r\n+    public static IResult RedirectToRoute(string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary? routeValues, bool permanent = false, bool preserveMethod = false, string? fragment = null);\r\n+    public static IResult CreatedAtRoute(string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues, object? value = null);\r\n+    public static IResult CreatedAtRoute<TValue>(string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues, TValue? value = default);\r\n+    public static IResult AcceptedAtRoute(string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues, object? value = null);\r\n+    public static IResult AcceptedAtRoute<TValue>(string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues, TValue? value = default);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static partial class TypedResults\r\n{\r\n+    public static RedirectToRouteHttpResult RedirectToRoute(string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary? routeValues, bool permanent = false, bool preserveMethod = false, string? fragment = null);\r\n+    public static CreatedAtRoute CreatedAtRoute(string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues);\r\n+    public static CreatedAtRoute<TValue> CreatedAtRoute<TValue>(TValue? value, string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues);\r\n+    public static AcceptedAtRoute AcceptedAtRoute(string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues);\r\n+    public static AcceptedAtRoute<TValue> AcceptedAtRoute<TValue>(TValue? value, string? routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\napp.MapGet(\"/old-path\", () => Results.CreatedAtRoute(\"RouteName\", new RouteValueDictionary { [\"routeValue1\"] = \"value!\" }));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nGeneric type parameter for route values was explored in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46082. For example:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\npublic static partial class Results\r\n{\r\n+    public static IResult CreatedAtRoute<[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.All)] TRouteValues>(string? routeName, TRouteValues routeValues, object? value = null);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt doesn't require converting the route values object into a `RouteValueDictionary`, but it has some problems:\r\n\r\n1. It doesn't work with polymorphism. Property values are gotten from the route value type based on its runtime type. If the route value instance is cast to `object` and then used with `CreatedAtRoute<TRouteValues>`, its properties aren't preserved.\r\n2. It could be a source-breaking change. There will now be a `CreatedAtRoute<TRouteValues>` overload and a `CreatedAtRoute<TValue>` overload. Code that explicitly specifies the generic type when calling `CreatedAtRoute` could cause an ambiguous method compiler error.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nreturn Results.CreatedAtRoute<object>(\"RouteName\", new { param1 = \"param1Value\" }, new User());\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of overloads, optional parameters and nullable types. It is possible to create method overloads that are ambiguous.\r\n\r\nTo avoid that:\r\n\r\n1. `RouteValueDictionary` args never have a default value. It must be specified.\r\n2.  Tests for methods must be extensive.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/46542","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add RouteValueDictionary overloads to Http.Results\" (#46542)"},{"Id":"1577143771","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-09T02:56:22","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"46541","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add AOT flag to worker template","State":"open","Body":"The worker template is compatible with native AOT.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

We've decided to walk this back though.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nYou can add a custom convention that removes the `MethodInfo` from the endpoint metadata or wait for RC 2 to revert this behavior.

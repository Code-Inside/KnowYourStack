The master branch was at 57mb startup that's reliving, so I went to develop to confirm it's the logging and oh no it still around 57 and barely any GC events, so I was continued looking till I discovered it was the feature branch I were working on the MapStaticFiles port to complete the migration to .net 9. UFF I was looking more into the issue and could confirm it's the staticfiles feature I analyzed the heap by my best ability. I created a reproduction project, taking just the .net 9 Blazor template and reverting it to use UseStaticFiles \n\nThere the impact of the startup was not that huge (expected since there are only 3 static assets mapped compared to my lib which has around 12) but somehow the difference is just 2x more memory consumption compared to my lib which suffered a 10x increase. So I assume it increases on a linier basis relative to the amount of static files served, but that's only a rough guess though the collected data\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA slight reduction of runtime memory and not an increase and raw startup time should be similar *(not build time mentioned) since the mapping will be done on build time as far I understood through the docs and presentation of the .net 9 release\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nJust take the repo and run it to confirm the same results that i gathered on my machine via performance profile\n\nI create 2 separate project based on the latest .net 9 Blazor web app template, the only difference is that one is unmodified and one modified to use the old UseStaticFiles\n\n[Reproduction Project](https://github.com/DeepWorks-Studios/AspNetCore-Reproduction-MemIssue-MapStaticAssets)\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nThat seems like the feature is not ready for shipment if it's not an edge case bug, since I can see a lot of project would suffer if they use it right now in this condition.\n\nFor me, I invested now my whole night to gather the intel and report it properly \nBut regardless of that I know I can't use the feature at this stage and need to push back the feature branch out of my planned release and will need to wait till Microsoft pushes hopefully soon a patch for that major issue since for me 10x increase memory is unbearable.\n\nPersonally I hope my invested time was not a waste \n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.200\n\n### Anything else?\n\nAll data can be found in the [Reproduction Project](https://github.com/DeepWorks-Studios/AspNetCore-Reproduction-MemIssue-MapStaticAssets)\n\n!Failed to upload \"BlazorAppWithMapStaticAssets-BuildLog.txt\" --> Can be found on the repo project\n[BlazorAppWithMapStaticAssets-Counters.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19331443/BlazorAppWithMapStaticAssets-Counters.txt)\n[BlazorAppWithMapStaticAssets-DebugLog.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19331445/BlazorAppWithMapStaticAssets-DebugLog.txt)\n!Failed to upload \"BlazorAppWithUseStaticAssets-BuildLog.txt\" --> Can be found on the repo project\n[BlazorAppWithUseStaticAssets-Counters.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19331442/BlazorAppWithUseStaticAssets-Counters.txt)\n[BlazorAppWithUseStaticAssets-DebugLog.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19331446/BlazorAppWithUseStaticAssets-DebugLog.txt)\n[DotNetEnvorimentInfo.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19331447/DotNetEnvorimentInfo.txt)\n[SystemEnvorimentInfo.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19331444/SystemEnvorimentInfo.txt)\n\n### MapStaticFiles\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7707eae9-05f2-44ad-b6a7-c92ae946e7ac)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f5dde13-9b3f-4457-bc0e-d3f4b8d2c7ca)\n### UseStaticFiles\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4eed08d-3159-4dee-9278-0d994694bd87)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f51218a-82b0-4c96-b800-fb647b8377c6)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61008","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".Net 9 Blazor MapStaticFiles unusable\" (#61008)"},{"Id":"2930176424","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-19T01:20:50","Actor":"RussKie","Number":"61007","RawContent":null,"Title":"Transitive package to provide coherency in dotnet/extensions","State":"open","Body":"Relates to https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/6132\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/61007","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Transitive package to provide coherency in dotnet/extensions\" (#61007)"},{"Id":"2930122468","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-19T00:34:03","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"61006","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove unneeded 'fixed' statements from SocketAddress","State":"open","Body":"Part of the \"reduce unsafe\" effort across the dotnet org.\r\n\r\nA prototype static analysis rule identified SocketAddress as being a good candidate to remove a `fixed` statement.

The usage is purely internal today and also has the issue of never releasing its memory resulting in users thinking there is a memory leak. See: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/55490\n\nAs part of wanting to reduce the memory when the pool is idle we want to use a timer, but creating a timer per pool is not ideal, so we want to put the cleanup on the kestrel heartbeat thread which requires sharing between Sockets, NamedPipes, and Kestrel Core. Ideally we want to avoid internals visible to, so in order to solve this we need a type that can be used by all dlls and shared via DI so we can wire up the pool usage everywhere.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n[Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections.Abstractions.dll](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/Servers/Connections.Abstractions/src/Features)\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections;\n\n+ public interface IMemoryPoolFactory\n+ {\n+    MemoryPool<byte> CreatePool();\n+ }\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.Services.AddSingleton<IMemoryPoolFactory, MyMemoryPoolFactory>();\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\npublic sealed class MyMemoryPoolFactory : IMemoryPoolFactory\n{\n    public MemoryPool<byte> CreatePool()\n    {\n        return MemoryPool<byte>.Shared;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nAlternatively we can use `[InternalsVisibleTo]` on some of our assemblies.\n\n## Risks\n\nN/A\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61003","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add IMemoryPoolFactory to Connections.Abstractions\" (#61003)"},{"Id":"2929916466","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T21:32:55","Actor":"sardar97","Number":"61002","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a Tailwind CSS Template for Blazor in .NET CLI","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nCurrently, when creating a new Blazor project using the .NET CLI (dotnet new blazor), the default template includes Bootstrap as the primary CSS framework. While Bootstrap is widely used, Tailwind CSS has gained significant popularity among developers for its utility-first approach, flexibility, and performance benefits.\n\nIt would be beneficial to provide an official Tailwind CSS template for Blazor projects, similar to the existing Bootstrap-based template. This would allow developers who prefer Tailwind over Bootstrap to start with a clean, optimized setup without having to manually remove Bootstrap and configure Tailwind.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n**Add a Tailwind option to the Blazor project template**\nExample command:\n`dotnet new blazor -css tailwind`\nThis would generate a Blazor project pre-configured with Tailwind CSS, replacing Bootstrap styles and dependencies.\n**Support for Blazor Server & WebAssembly :**\nThe template should support both Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.\n\n### Additional context\n\nMany developers manually configure Tailwind in Blazor projects by removing Bootstrap and setting up Tailwind from scratch.

I wanted to showcase different ways of creating middleware and how to use dependency injection.\n\nI encountered an issue: when using convention-based middleware, we can inject a scoped dependency using method injection, but when using constructor injection, this is not possible!\n\nI decided to investigate the repository to find the root cause, and the issue likely lies in the UseMiddlewareExtensions class:\n\n🔗 https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Http/Http.Abstractions/src/Extensions/UseMiddlewareExtensions.cs#L131\n\nIn line 131, an instance is created and returned when only a single parameter—HttpContext—is provided. However, if there are additional parameters, the assumption is that they are dependencies injected via method injection. The key difference here is that in the latter case, RequestServices are used from the HttpContext to resolve dependencies:\n\n🔗 https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Http/Http.Abstractions/src/Extensions/UseMiddlewareExtensions.cs#L145\n\nI believe a similar approach could be applied when handling a single parameter. Instead of simply using ApplicationServices, we should also consider services registered as Scoped and served via HttpContext.\n\nBelow is my proposed fix—I'd be happy to submit a correction if this solution is accepted. There will be a slight change in behavior: previously, the CreateMiddleware method verified whether the instance could be created upfront, whereas now, this verification will occur at invocation time.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f519846b-ab4b-455b-b7f9-429d0857b002)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAble to use scoped dependencies using both constructor and method injection. \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nPlease check created repository - https://github.com/jwierzbanowski/middleware-scoped-dependency-repro \n\nOr to reproduce, create new Web Api project, add convention-based middleware with Scoped dependency in constructor.

Localization. During culture change strange exceptions occur","State":"open","Body":"I used the Blazor Web App (.net-9.0.3) template to create a project with global interactivity (InteractiveServer).\n\nI followed the localization directions from Microsoft at [Globalization and localization][1] in paragraph **Dynamically set the server-side culture by user preference**.\n\nIt didn't work as expected and has also obvious mistakes (like confusing `app.razor` with `routes.razor`).\n\nAnyway, I fixed localization with small adaptations with the following change:\n\nInstead of \n\n    var supportedCultures = new[] { \"en-US\", \"es-CR\" };\n    var localizationOptions = new RequestLocalizationOptions()\n        .SetDefaultCulture(supportedCultures[0])\n        .AddSupportedCultures(supportedCultures)\n        .AddSupportedUICultures(supportedCultures);\n        \n     app.UseRequestLocalization(localizationOptions);\n\nI use:\n\n    public static CultureInfo[] SupportedCultures =\n       [\n          new CultureInfo(\"el-GR\"),\n          new CultureInfo(\"en-US\"),\n       ];\n\n    builder.Services.AddLocalization();\n    builder.Services.Configure<RequestLocalizationOptions>(options =>\n    {\n        options.SupportedCultures = SupportedCultures;\n        options.SupportedUICultures = SupportedCultures;\n        options.RequestCultureProviders.Clear();\n        options.RequestCultureProviders.Insert(0, new CookieRequestCultureProvider());\n        options.DefaultRequestCulture = new RequestCulture(culture: \"el-GR\");\n    \n    });\n    builder.Services.AddControllers();\n\nSo, culture changes, **BUT**\n\nduring debugging, in every culture change, output window is filled with exceptions: \n\n> Exception thrown: 'System.IO.IOException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll  \n> Exception thrown: 'System.IO.IOException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll  \n> Exception thrown: 'System.IO.IOException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll  \n> Exception thrown: 'System.Net.WebSockets.WebSocketException' in System.Net.WebSockets.dll  \n> Exception thrown: 'System.Net.WebSockets.WebSocketException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll\n\nAll these exceptions maybe are thrown due to violent app restar. All server interactive components are disposed and re-initialized several times (during prerender then for rendering etc.).\n\nThese 5 exceptions are thrown with an empty template project. \n\nBy adding a couple of working components the number of exceptions become frightening:\n\n>Exception thrown: 'System.InvalidOperationException' in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.dll\n>Exception

Create a new WebAPI project (`dotnet new webapi`)\n2. Add package reference to `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server` version 9.0.2\n3. Replace the existing `Program.cs` that came with the template with this code:\n```c#\nusing System.Text.Json.Serialization;\n\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenApi();\nbuilder.Services.ConfigureHttpJsonOptions(options =>\n{\n    options.SerializerOptions.Converters.Add(new JsonStringEnumConverter());\n});\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n    app.MapOpenApi();\n\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => new Res(EnumResult.A, \"Test\"));\n\napp.Run();\n\nrecord Res(EnumResult? Result, string SomeValue);\nenum EnumResult\n{\n    A,\n    B\n}\n```\n4. Build and examine the generated JSON schema\n\nFor the other scenario (where the enum is not encapsulated within another model) use the following code:\n```c#\nusing System.Text.Json.Serialization;\n\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenApi();\nbuilder.Services.ConfigureHttpJsonOptions(options =>\n{\n    options.SerializerOptions.Converters.Add(new JsonStringEnumConverter());\n});\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n    app.MapOpenApi();\n\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => EnumResult.A)\n    .Produces<EnumResult?>();\n\napp.Run();\n\nenum EnumResult\n{\n    A,\n    B\n}\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.200\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

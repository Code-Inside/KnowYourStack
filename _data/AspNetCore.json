changed","State":"open","Body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI am looking at an efficient way to optimize redundant rendering of complex reusable components (e.g. grid).\r\n\r\nHere's a rough draft of the approach that I'm considering:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n        protected bool m_shouldRender = false;\r\n\r\n        protected override void OnParametersSet()\r\n        {\r\n            if (PrimitiveDataTypeParametersChanged() || ReferenceParametersChanged())\r\n            {\r\n                m_shouldRender = true;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected override bool ShouldRender()\r\n        {\r\n            if (m_shouldRender == true)\r\n            {\r\n                m_shouldRender = false;\r\n                return true;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the component will be rendered only if any of the parameter values have changed. According to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/webassembly-performance-best-practices?view=aspnetcore-5.0#avoid-unnecessary-rendering-of-component-subtrees guidance, the framework is already detecting ``PrimitiveDataTypeParametersChanged`` condition - if a component consists only of primitive data type parameters that have not changed, ``OnParametersSet`` is not called to begin with.\r\n\r\nI want to avoid declaring a member field for each parameter to track if it has changed - this is an error prone approach and makes the code look rather cumbersome. Another approach is to use reflection to list all parameter properties and store their values in a dictionary - but it does require some additional CPU cycles that I'd like to avoid - clearly Blazor must be doing something similar internally that I'd like to take advantage of. Is this possible? If not, can you show me the lines in source code that perform this check?\r\n\r\nWith respect to complex data types (references), I'm OK with storing their previous values internally. Consumers of my components will understand that if any of the properties of reference parameters change, they will need to call a public ``Render`` method that will then call ``StateHasChanged``. Practically speaking, this will only be needed in scenarios such as adding a new row to a grid that is not bound to ``ObservableCollection`` - it's an inconvenience that I'm willing to accept.\r\n\r\nI would really prefer not to even bother with this approach, but as various tickets indicate, unnecessary rendering of components is a problem.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32163","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Detecting which parameters have changed\" (#32163)"},{"Id":"867131625","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-25T22:38:03","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"32162","RawContent":null,"Title":"Shorten default timeout to 5 seconds with a debug build","State":"open","Body":"30 seconds is a long time to wait for a unit test to fail when developing on a local machine.

blocks without preceding @ symbol","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nI'm posting this based on aspnet/Razor.VSCode pointing to this repository. Apologies if its the wrong location.\r\n\r\nI recently stared using VSCode instead of Visual studio and noticed the razor syntax highlighting is sub optimal. In one particular case, it was highlighting content totally different of how the compiler would interpret it, leading to subtle bugs.\r\n\r\nThis particular case involves the @ symbol that precedes code blocks and statements in razor templates. \r\n\r\nIn the following case, this if statement is not actually compiled as an if statement, yet Razor syntax highlighting in VS Code shows it as an if statement instead of plaintext. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/348719/116001114-d06f2b00-a5a7-11eb-81cd-2c2869211780.png)\r\n\r\nHere is the same snippet in Visual Studio 2019. Syntax highlighting is correctly marking it as plaintext.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/348719/116001068-9736bb00-a5a7-11eb-9853-a9ce93b3140c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install the C# Extension for VS Code (I'm using v1.23.11).\r\n2. Create a new file \r\n3.

Your report may be eligible for our [bug bounty](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core) but ONLY if it is reported through email.\r\nFor other types of questions, consider using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n#### Passing an object that has a cyclic relationship with another object as parameter to a Razor component via an MVC view throws a `JsonException`.  \r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nI have created a new project to reproduce the problem: [JsonExceptionRepro](https://github.com/amal-stack/JsonExceptionRepro). \r\n\r\nThe project has been created using the ASP.NET Core MVC template. \r\nTo add support for Razor components, I have:\r\n- Added `services.AddServerSideBlazor()` in `ConfigureServices()`\r\n- Added `endpoints.MapBlazorHub()` in `Configure()`.\r\n- Added `<base href=\"~/\">` in the head section of `_Layout.cshtml` and also added a script reference to `blazor.server.js`.\r\n\r\nIn the `Models` folder, I have created two classes with cyclic dependencies. This is a common practice to add navigation properties in EF Core. :\r\n```\r\nclass Question { ... List<Answer> Answers { get; set; } }\r\n```\r\n```\r\nclass Answer { ... Question Question { get; set; } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `Controllers/HomeController`, I have added two actions `ThisWillWork()` and `ThisWillNotWork()` to demonstrate how having the inner property set causes the exception. \r\n\r\n#### What I have tried\r\nI tried adding the following to `Startup.cs`:\r\n```\r\nservices.AddControllersWithViews()\r\n                .AddJsonOptions(options => options.JsonSerializerOptions.ReferenceHandler = ReferenceHandler.Preserve); \r\n```\r\nThis probably is not affecting the component.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I could think of is to pass only the object's ID as parameter to the component and use the DB Context in the component's code section to look up the object. I have asked a related question on StackOverflow but I didn't get any help yet: [Is it safe to inject the DbContext service into a Razor component of an ASP.NET Core project?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67232177/is-it-safe-to-inject-the-dbcontext-service-into-a-razor-component-of-an-asp-net?noredirect=1#comment118849095_67232177)\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n> JsonException: A possible object cycle was detected. This can either be due to a cycle or if the object depth is larger than the maximum allowed depth of 64. Consider using ReferenceHandler.Preserve on JsonSerializerOptions to support cycles.\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- ASP.NET Core version\r\n5.0.5\r\n- Include the output of `dotnet

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This is primarily used to support runtime-compilation based scenarios.\r\n\r\nPrior to .NET 6, `PreserveCompilationContext` was configured to `true` for all apps that target the Razor (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor`) and Web (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`) apps.

This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`. This will not affect any typical application code as it is only a detail of the low-level platform implementation.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe property `EventArgsType` described a nonstandard, Blazor-specific category name for groups of DOM event types. For example, the `click` and `mousedown` events were both mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `mouse`. Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`. There is no longer a need to supply a Blazor-specific category name, so the old property `EventArgsType` is removed.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nIn PR [#29993](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/29993) we have introduced support for custom event arguments classes. As part of this, we no longer rely on all events fitting into a predefined set of categories. The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

From the outset of this effort, [we anticipated that mistakes would be made](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/api-guidelines/nullability.md#breaking-change-guidance) in these annotations and fixes would need to be made.

For example, if a razor class library defined a static web asset to be served under `/folder/file.txt` and the host placed a file under `wwwroot/folder/file.txt` the file on the server would silently override the file on the Razor Class Library or Blazor Webassembly application.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core will now correctly detect when this issue happens and inform of the conflict so that users can be aware and take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis was a bug in the implementation, we never intended for static web assets to be \"overridable\" by files on the wwwroot host of the project since that leads to errors that are hard to diagnose and can result in undefined behavior changes when applications are published.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason for a file on a Razor Class Library to conflict with a file on the host by default since they are prefixed with `_content/${PackageId}` unless we are discussing Blazor Webassembly applications, which get placed by default at the root of the host url space, which makes conflicts easier. (For example, Blazor Webassembly Applications contain a favicon.ico that the host might also include in their wwwroot folder).\r\n\r\nIf the source of the conflict is a file in a Razor Class Library it normally means there is some code that copies the assets from the library into the wwwroot folder of the project. We don't recommend developers doing that since it defeats one of the main goals of static web assets which is that files don't have to be copied around, which is fundamental to get updates on the browser when the contents are updated without having to trigger a new compilation.\r\n\r\nIf despite that you want to preserve this behavior and maintain the file on the host, you can do so by removing the file from the list of static web assets with a custom MSBuild target.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the file on the razor class library or the blazor webassembly file instead of the file from the host project, just remove the file from the host project.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n\"Not detectable via API analysis\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updated validation logic for Static Web Assets\" (#443)"},{"Id":"724794249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-27T19:05:24","Actor":"tatti9018","Number":"442","RawContent":null,"Title":"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"Help with feature “Control Startup class activation”\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n            .ConfigureWebHost(builder =>\r\n            {\r\n                builder.UseStartup(context => new Startup(logger));\r\n            })\r\n            .Build();\r\n```\r\nWhen I use Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly”, I get error: ‘IHostBuilder’ does not contain a definition for ‘ConfigureWebHostDefaults’\r\nWhen I set Project Sdk=”Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, project see ConfigureWebHostDefaults, but project doesn’t work….","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/442","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feature “Control Startup class activation” doesn't work\" (#442)"},{"Id":"712253766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-30T20:21:51","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5","State":"open","Body":"## Updated Blazor browser support for .NET 5\r\n\r\n.NET 5 introduces a variety of [new Blazor features](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514), some of which are not compatible with certain older browsers.

The functionality provided by these packages was based on the AzureAD v1.0 endpoint. \r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 5.0 integration with AzureAD and AzureAD B2C authentication will be provided by [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web) which is based on Microsoft Identity Platform (formerly known as AzureAD v2.0 endpoint).

Starting from ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1, all of those readonly public fields have changed to readonly public properties.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect this change to affect many developers because:\r\n\r\n * Any application or library that simply uses `.razor` files (or even manual `RenderTreeBuilder` calls) to define its components would not be referencing this type directly\r\n * The `RenderTreeFrame` type itself is regarded as an implementation detail, not intended for use outside the framework. ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later includes an analyzer that issues compiler warnings if the type is being used directly.\r\n * Even if you do reference `RenderTreeFrame` directly, this change is binary-breaking but not source-breaking. That is, your existing source code will still compile and behave properly. You will only encounter an issue if compiling against the 3.x framework and then running those binaries against the 5.0 RC1 and later framework.\r\n\r\n## Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1\r\n\r\n## Old behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` were defined as fields, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\n## New behavior\r\n\r\nPublic members on `RenderTreeFrame` are defined as properties with the same names as before, for example `renderTreeFrame.Sequence` and `renderTreeFrame.ElementName`.\r\n\r\nIf older precompiled code has not been recompiled since this change, it may throw an exception similar to *MissingFieldException: Field not found: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame.FrameType'*.\r\n\r\n## Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary in order to implement some high-impact performance improvements in Blazor component rendering on ASP.NET Core 5.0 while retaining the same level of safety and encapsulation as before.\r\n\r\n## Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Blazor developers will not be affected and do not need to take action. This is most likely to affect library/package authors, but still only rarely. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* If you are developing an application, and either staying on ASP.NET Core 3.x or upgrading to 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to make any changes to your own code.\r\n   * However if you depend on a library that needs to upgrade to account for this change, then you would need to update to a newer version of that library.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support only ASP.NET Core 5.0 RC1 or later, you don't need to take any action. Just ensure that your `csproj` declares the `TargetFramework` value `net5.0`.\r\n* If you are developing a library, and intend to support both ASP.NET Core 3.x *and* 5.0, then check whether or not your code attempts to read any of the members of `RenderTreeFrame` (for example, evaluating `someRenderTreeFrame.FrameType`).\r\n    * Most libraries will not do that. This includes libraries that contain `.razor` components. In this case you don't need to take any action.\r\n    * However, if your library does do that, then you will need to use multitargeting to support both `netstandard2.1` and `net5.0`. First, in your `csproj`, replace the existing `<TargetFramework>` with `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`. Then instead of referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` with a fixed version number such as 3.0.0, use a conditional reference to account for both versions you wish to support. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"3.0.0\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\" Version=\"5.0.0-rc.1.*\" Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' != 'netstandard2.0'\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further clarification, see this [diff showing how @jsakamoto already upgraded his `Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement` library in this way](https://github.com/jsakamoto/Toolbelt.Blazor.HeadElement/commit/090df430ba725f9420d412753db8104e8c32bf51).\r\n\r\n## Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n## Affected APIs\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.RenderTreeFrame`","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fields on RenderTreeFrame have become properties\" (#438)"},{"Id":"696062913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T17:46:46","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-1045 | Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core.

If the exception handler, configured via [`ExceptionHandlerOptions.ExceptionHandlingPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.exceptionhandleroptions.exceptionhandlingpath) for example, cannot be found, a 404 response will be produced. The 404 error is especially misleading since it makes it seem like an user error and obscures the fact that an exception occurred on the server.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the default behavior of `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception if the exception handler could not be found. As a result, a 500 response will be produced by the server and it will be more obvious to examine the server logs when debugging the error that occurred.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will currently produce a 404 error response when the configured exception handler could not be found when the middleware executes. \r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nBy default, the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` will now throw the original exception when the configured exception handler could not be found (i.e. the exception handler returns a 404) when the middleware executes. To allow 404 responses to be returned by the exception handler, please configure the option `AllowStatusCode404Response` on `ExceptionHandlerOptions` to `true`. When this option is set to true, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe have often seen `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` with misconfigured handlers producing 404 responses leading to confusion since the 404 error doesn't make it obvious an exception occurred on the server. This change is made so that a 500 error will be produced instead to make it more obvious that it's not caused by user error but rather an exception was encountered on the server.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThere is no API change due to this breaking change so all existing apps will continue to compile and run. The exception thrown will be handled by the server.

The functionality will instead be provided by `DatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter` and its extension methods instead.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 RC 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\n`DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware` and its associated extension methods were not obsolete.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\n`DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware` and its associated extension methods are now obsolete.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe are migrating the existing database error page middleware to the new extensible API for `DeveloperExceptionPage`.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\n1. Remove uses of `DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware`in your app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n    {\r\n        app.UseDatabaseErrorPage();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Ensure `DeveloperExeptionPage` and `MigrationsEndpoint` are added to your app:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n    {\r\n        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\r\n        app.UseMigrationsEndPoint();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add `DatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter` to your services:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n{\r\n    services.AddDatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter();\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n  [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.DatabaseErrorPageMiddleware`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.diagnostics.entityframeworkcore.databaseerrorpagemiddleware)\r\n  [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.DatabaseErrorPageExtensions.UseDatabaseErrorPage`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.databaseerrorpageextensions.usedatabaseerrorpage)\r\n\r\nSee discussion at: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24987\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/432","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting DatabaseErrorPage middleware\" (#432)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1384552432710029321","CreatedAt":"2021-04-20T16:59:58+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Community Standup - https://t.co/eFOzgs22K8 Core updates in .NET 6 - Chat live at… https://t.co/F5kdLCLiKG","Source":"<a href=\"https://periscope.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Periscope</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1384552117210214406","CreatedAt":"2021-04-20T16:58:43+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!

This leads to issues where the server knows the client is authenticated meaning the client can navigate to components that require authentication, but the client thinks the user is unauthenticated for the purposes of rendering something like:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<AuthorizeView>\r\n    <Authorized>\r\n        <p>You are authorized</p>\r\n        Hello @context.User.Identity?.Name!\r\n    </Authorized>\r\n    <NotAuthorized>\r\n        <p>You are not authorized</p>\r\n    </NotAuthorized>\r\n</AuthorizeView>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was caused by the `PersistentAuthenticationStateProvider` on the client attempting to read the `UserInfo` from `PersistentComponentState` after enhanced navigation. At this point the state from the original page load (`/counter` in the examples below) is cleared, and the state that was persisted during the enhanced navigation to `/auth` is simply ignored and never read by anyone despite calling the `RegisterOnPersisting` callback and rendering the state for each enhanced navigation. The `PersistentComponentState` behavior is by design according to @javiercn, and we can make auth work reliably with the current `PersistentComponentState` behavior by greedily reading the `UserInfo` during initial render before any enhanced navigation which is what this PR does.\r\n\r\nFixes #51368\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThis was thankfully reported by a customer trying out the new Identity Blazor components in RC2. It's possible to get into this state with just the template code if a browser session starts in (or reload on) the template's `/counter` page and then does enhanced navigation to a component that uses an `<AuthorizeView>` like the template's `/auth` page. Without this fix, the user is forced to refresh the `/auth` page or any other page with `<AuthorizeView>` before they can see any rendered content that requires authorization.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/54385/742ab1d9-901e-4489-b4d4-183de6423aa5\r\n\r\nNotice how the second time I navigate to the \"Auth Required\" page after refreshing on the \"Counter\" page, you see \"You are authenticated\" followed by \"You are not authorized\" even though any authenticated user should be authorized to see that page. After the fix, you always see \"You are authenticated\" followed by \"You are authorized\" and \"Hello {email}!\" as expected.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/54385/f8549468-ec68-4dfa-8e8c-800a29e6e349\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [ ] High\r\n- [ ] Medium\r\n- [x] Low\r\n\r\nThis is a small change to a single Blazor Identity template component added in RC 2 which slightly simplifies the logic.\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\n- [x] Manual (required)\r\n- [ ] Automated\r\n\r\n## Packaging changes reviewed?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n- [x] N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/51497","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix Blazor template bug where a logged in user could appear to be unauthenticated\" (#51497)"},{"Id":"1953345419","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-20T01:52:15","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"51510","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enable using the Blazor WebAssembly loading progress indicator in a Blazor Web App","State":"open","Body":"In Blazor WebAssembly apps we provided a loading progress indicator that acted as placeholder while the app loaded.

The current mechanism for this relies on the WebAssembly runtime having started up so it can be asked which capabilities it supports. However, in Blazor Web scenarios, WebAssembly runtime startup might be delayed indefinitely, which causes the mechanism to read hot reload capabilities to fail.\r\n\r\nWe worked around this problem in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/36195 by having a fallback, default set of capabilities to use if reading capabilities from the WebAssembly runtime fails.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\nWe could go one of two directions in the future to fully address this issue:\r\n* Expand the capabilities of `dotnet watch` to dynamically update the set of available capabilities if a new runtime becomes available (relatively high complexity)\r\n* Remove WebAssembly capabilities detection completely and rely on the fallback capabilities only (simpler)\r\n\r\nTo simplify the Blazor WebAssembly hot reload infrastructure and make the overall hot reload experience less error prone, I propose we go with the 2nd option that simplifies WebAssembly hot reload capabilities detection by having the full set of capabilities be known by the `dotnet watch` tool without having to dynamically fetch those capabilities from the WebAssembly runtime.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51507","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Simplify WebAssembly hot reload capabilities detection\"

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nThe EditContext for form validation is missing support for an asynchronous [custom validator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/forms-and-input-components?view=aspnetcore-7.0#validator-components). If I want to implement form validation that does asynchronous operations like server calls or using the async [FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/) library, I have to implement some hacks instead of using a custom validator component. The EditForm or custom form implementations have no way of invoking the Validate method on the EditContext asynchronosly to in turn have the EditContext invoke the OnValidationRequested event asynchronously. It appears though that this is something that's planned. But I'm not sure if this will happen or when? It seems this would be a simple feature to implement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI can implement an asynchronous event handler for the OnValidationRequested event of the EditContext. The Validate method of the EditContext and in turn the EditForm await the execution of this event handler.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm also happy to contribute to this feature with a pull request. I was thinking of something like this inside the EditContext (just a draft):\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// Validates this <see cref=\"EditContext\"/>.\r\n/// </summary>\r\n/// <returns>True if there are no validation messages after validation; otherwise false.</returns>\r\npublic bool Validate() // Existing method\r\n{\r\n    OnValidationRequested?.Invoke(this, ValidationRequestedEventArgs.Empty);\r\n    return !GetValidationMessages().Any();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic event Func<object?, EventArgs, Task> OnValidationRequestedAsync; // New\r\n\r\npublic async Task<bool> ValidateAsync() // New\r\n{\r\n    OnValidationRequested?.Invoke(this, ValidationRequestedEventArgs.Empty);\r\n\r\n    await Task.WhenAll(OnValidationRequestedAsync\r\n        .GetInvocationList()\r\n        .Cast<Func<object?, EventArgs, Task>>()\r\n        .Select(invocation => invocation(this, EventArgs.Empty)));\r\n\r\n    return !GetValidationMessages().Any();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe EditForm already has a HandleSubmitAsync method which instead of calling the sync Validate method could call the async ValidateAsync method. This way the change would be non breaking.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task HandleSubmitAsync()\r\n{\r\n    Debug.Assert(_editContext != null);\r\n\r\n    if (OnSubmit.HasDelegate)\r\n    {\r\n        // When using OnSubmit, the developer takes control of the validation lifecycle\r\n        await OnSubmit.InvokeAsync(_editContext);\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        // Otherwise, the system implicitly runs validation on form submission\r\n        var isValid = _editContext.Validate(); // This will likely become ValidateAsync later\r\n\r\n        if (isValid && OnValidSubmit.HasDelegate)\r\n        {\r\n            await OnValidSubmit.InvokeAsync(_editContext);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!isValid && OnInvalidSubmit.HasDelegate)\r\n        {\r\n            await OnInvalidSubmit.InvokeAsync(_editContext);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEdit: Apparently async form validation has already been discussed years ago and then been abandoned. However, I think the approach I'm thinking of is different. I don't plan on doing an async validation on each field change. Rather the async validation is only run once the form is being submitted which I think is legitimate.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51501","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add async support to form validation with EditContext on submit\" (#51501)"},{"Id":"1951514099","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-19T16:46:43","Actor":"Kumima","Number":"51489","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor Web Individual Account Template does not have the Logout form handler","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?

inconsistencies","State":"open","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nA few small nits / inconsistencies after creating a new \"Blazor Web App\" template with the following options\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/4984486/835550e5-3984-4fef-961b-fb2318a01177)\r\n\r\n1. ``ManageNavMenu.razor`` in ``Components\\Layout`` has superfluous ``;`` that can be omitted:\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/4984486/e4c7b0af-c4f4-474f-9e4d-dfc0901da7f8)\r\n\r\n2. In the same file, the private component variable is prefixed with an underscore:\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/4984486/1ddd7189-3ec4-4a82-87a4-40aa2d6c8ef7)\r\nHowever, in the Weather.razor the underscore-less convention is used:\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/4984486/f1cf0ed3-216c-48a9-af71-23280df7e216)\r\nMy personal coding style is: If it is used in the razor template, use a private property, else a private variable with underscore. That way I can distinct private vars only for the code section and vars used in the render template.  \r\nRegisterConfirmation.razor is then inconsistent again with no explicit private modifier and no underscore. Same in ResetPassword.razor\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/4984486/b17519d2-7da2-41d2-8b3c-3b063294002e)\r\n\r\n3. ``StatusMessage.razor`` has logic in the razor template. I would avoid doing that and move the code block at the top into OnParametersSet override.\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/4984486/3dee07af-4757-4b37-a085-1849da52f0d3)\r\n\r\n4.

The first one (\"/\" does not require any authorization).\r\n2. The second one (\"/protected\") requires authorization.\r\n3. The third one (\"/login\") automatically logs in a user.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\n1. When I start the project up, the default route in the Microsoft Edge shows \"Hello SecureApp!\".\r\n2. When I navigate to \"/protected\", it gives authorization error asking me to login, which is what I expect.\r\n3. Then I navigate to \"/login\", which automatically signs me in and shows \"loggedIn as MyUser5e47f268-bebb-4aac-bd6d-933507d2fbdd\"\r\n4. I can see that cookie is issued to localhost domain in Edge dev tools.\r\n6. Then I navigate to \"/protected\", I can see the above cookie is being sent in the request to the server.\r\n7. However, instead of giving me access to this protected resource (because of the auth cookie), it still tells me to login.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;\r\nusing System.Security.Claims;\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\r\n    .AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);\r\n\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthorization();\r\n\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\napp.UseAuthentication();\r\napp.UseAuthentication();\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello SecureApp!\");\r\n\r\napp.MapGet(\"/protected\", () => \"This is protected endpoint!\").RequireAuthorization();\r\napp.MapGet(\"/login\", (HttpContext context) =>\r\n{\r\n    var loggedInAs = \"MyUser\" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString();\r\n    var claim = new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, loggedInAs);\r\n\r\n    context.SignInAsync(new ClaimsPrincipal(new List<ClaimsIdentity>\r\n    {\r\n        new ClaimsIdentity(new List<Claim>()\r\n        {\r\n            claim\r\n        }, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\r\n    }));\r\n\r\n    return $\"loggedIn as {loggedInAs}\";\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe step 6 in my testing should have returned \"This is protected endpoint!\" because I already logged in. What am I missing?\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe code is already included above.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n8.0.100-rc.2.23502.2\r\n\r\n###

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

These events are fired with a context (for instance [TokenValidatedContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.tokenvalidatedcontext?view=aspnetcore-7.0)) that exposes a `SecurityToken` property of abstract type [SecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest). The default real implementation of SecurityToken changed from [JwtSecurityToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest) to [JsonWebToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identitymodel.jsonwebtokens.jsonwebtoken?view=msal-web-dotnet-latest).\r\nIf you really need to keep using `JwtSecurityToken`, you can re-enable it by setting `UseSecurityTokenValidators` on the `JwtBearerOptions`, `WsFederationOptions`, `OpenIdConnectOptions`.\r\n\r\nFor details [#aspnetcore/49469](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49469#issue) API Review.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n.NET 8 Preview 7\r\n\r\n### Previous behavior\r\nUntil ASP.NET Core 8-preview 7, these SecurityToken properties were implemented by a sub-class of SecurityToken named JwtSecurityToken, which is the previous generation of implementation of JWT.

These are some possible options that will keep the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return Accepted(new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult<Model> Get()\r\n{\r\n   return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status202Accepted, new Model());\r\n}\r\n\r\n//or\r\n\r\npublic Model Get()\r\n{\r\n   Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;\r\n   return new Model();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nMVC/API Controller actions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/485","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Breaking change]: ActionResult<T> set StatusCode to 200\" (#485)"},{"Id":"1149914360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-20T20:33:05","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"482","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Breaking change]: Blazor components are type activated by default","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\n\nStarting in .NET 7, Blazor components use [`ActivatorUtilities`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities) to instantiate components. This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

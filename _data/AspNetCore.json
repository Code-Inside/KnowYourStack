Your report may be eligible for our [bug bounty](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core) but ONLY if it is reported through email.\r\nFor other types of questions, consider using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n`CreateClient()` produces an `HttpClient` object that does not auto-inject correlation data when a [`System.Diagnostics.Activity`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.activity?view=netcore-3.1) is instantiated and started (using the [`Start()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.activity.start?view=netcore-3.1) method).\r\n\r\nBackground information about how to use `Activity` to send correlation data can be found here: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/improvements-in-net-core-3-0-for-troubleshooting-and-monitoring-distributed-apps/ (refer to the \"Initiate distributed trace in .NET Core 3.0 app\" section).\r\n\r\nThough the (docs.microsoft.com)[\"Test ASP.NET Core middleware\"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/middleware?view=aspnetcore-3.1) guidance states that `TestServer` \"does not try to replicate all `HttpClient` behavior\", having `TestServer` create an `HttpClient` object such that propagating any correlation data that may be found in the HTTP request header would make functional/integration tests of middleware more complete and righteous as distributed tracing & correlation support is significant to the story of developing & testing ASP.NET Core apps.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nWe ❤ code! Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a GitHub repo.\r\nFor a repro project, create a new ASP.NET Core project using the template of your your choice, apply the minimum required code to result in the issue you're observing.\r\n\r\nWe will close this issue if:\r\n- the repro project you share with us is complex. We can't investigate custom projects, so don't point us to such, please.\r\n- if we will not be able to repro the behavior you're reporting\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSuppose we had a test method like the sample one in (docs.microsoft.com)\"[Send requests with HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/middleware?view=aspnetcore-3.1#send-requests-with-httpclient)\". In addition, we'll wrap the call with an `Activity`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Fact]\r\npublic async Task MiddlewareTest_ReturnsNotFoundForRequest()\r\n{\r\n    using var host = await new HostBuilder()\r\n        .ConfigureWebHost(webBuilder =>\r\n        {\r\n            webBuilder\r\n                .UseTestServer()\r\n                .ConfigureServices(services =>\r\n                {\r\n                    services.AddMyServices();\r\n                })\r\n                .Configure(app =>\r\n                {\r\n                    app.UseMiddleware<MyMiddleware>();\r\n                });\r\n        })\r\n        .StartAsync();\r\n\r\n    var activity = new Activity(\"CallToBackend\").SetIdFormat(ActivityIdFormat.W3C).Start();\r\n    {\r\n        var response = await host.GetTestServer().CreateClient().GetAsync(\"/\");\r\n    }\r\n    finally\r\n    {\r\n        activity.Stop();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd expect that when the registered middleware code is reached, the \"traceparent\" header would be valued (since the Activity ID's format was set to the W3C standard above). However, when the test is run, the expected \"traceparent\" header does not exist in the request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public class CorrelationValidationMiddleware\r\n    {\r\n        // ...\r\n\r\n        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)\r\n        {\r\n            if (context.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(\"traceparent\", out StringValues headerValue) == false)\r\n            {\r\n                context.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.BadRequest;\r\n                await context.Response.WriteAsync($\"The 'traceparent' header is missing.\").ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // ...\r\n\r\n            // Call the next delegate/middleware in the pipeline\r\n            await this.next(context).ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you were to instantiate a new `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` (i.e. `HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient()`) in the unit test (not from `TestServer.CreateClient()`), the \"traceparent\" header would be present along with the generated value.\r\n\r\nJust for your information, my team has developed a workaround so that our instantiated `TestServer` objects in our functional/integration tests produces an `HttpClient` that supports distributed tracing (just as if you were instantiating a new ``System.Net.Http.HttpClient` object outside the `TestServer`) using an extension method:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static class TestServerExtensions\r\n    {\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Creates an HTTP client.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        /// <remarks>\r\n        /// <para>\r\n        /// This method creates an <see cref=\"HttpClient\" /> containing a <c>DiagnosticsHandler</c> so that the\r\n        /// distributed tracing from an <see cref=\"Activity\" /> can automatically be injected into the request\r\n        /// header.\r\n        /// </para>\r\n        /// <para>\r\n        /// This extension method is a workaround solution as the created <see cref=\"HttpClient\" /> from the\r\n        /// <see cref=\"TestServer.CreateClient\" /> method does not inject distributed tracing into the request\r\n        /// header from an instantiated <see cref=\"Activity\" /> as expected.\r\n        /// </para>\r\n        /// </remarks>\r\n        /// <param name=\"testServer\">This <see cref=\"TestServer\" />.</param>\r\n        /// <returns>The HTTP client.</returns>\r\n        public static HttpClient CreateClientWithDiagnosticsHandler(this TestServer testServer)\r\n        {\r\n            Assembly assembly = Assembly.Load(\"System.Net.Http\");\r\n            Type diagnosticsHandlerType = assembly.GetType(\"System.Net.Http.DiagnosticsHandler\");\r\n\r\n            HttpMessageHandler handler =\r\n              (HttpMessageHandler)Activator.CreateInstance(diagnosticsHandlerType, testServer.CreateHandler());\r\n            return new HttpClient(handler) { BaseAddress = testServer.BaseAddress };\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n<!-- \r\nInclude the exception you get when facing this issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- ASP.NET Core version\r\n- Include the output of `dotnet --info`\r\n- The IDE (VS / VS Code/ VS4Mac) you're running on, and it's version\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24633","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TestServer.CreateClient() produces an HttpClient that does not auto-inject distributed tracing when Activity is used\" (#24633)"},{"Id":"674500533","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-06T21:02:31","Actor":"MackinnonBuck","Number":"24624","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixed flaky test 'CanInfluenceHeadDuringPrerender'.","State":"closed","Body":"Failures were caused by references to stale elements.

Please describe.\r\n\r\nI am trying out integrating Blazor Server Side into an existing ASP.NET Core MVC 3.1 web application. I am using the `<component type=\"typeof(..)\"./>` TagHelper and everything is working nicely, but one glaring issue is that developers and content authors alike will not be able to use relative URLs (`<a href=\"../path-to/other-page/relative-to-current-page.html\">Other Page</a>`).\r\n\r\nNot the end of the world but it would be nice to benefit from Blazor without taking on this sometimes awkward convention--a convention that makes sense for Blazor only SPAs, but can conflict with other assumptions/pre-existing conditions when embedding Blazor into an existing or multi-paradigm web application.\r\n\r\nI looked through [open issues related to blazor base href](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/search?q=blazor+base+href&state=open&type=Issues) and found nothing that addresses my issue directly. I found quite a few issues that demonstrate that the current convention creates challenges. It also seems to be surprising since using paths like \"~/whatever\" is a standard convention when it is necessary to reference a resource relative to the root of an ASP.NET Core web application.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nPlease provide an alternative to `<base href=\"/\" />` to specify the root of a Blazor app.\r\n\r\nAn alternative could look like this in a static context:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<meta name=\"blazor-base-href\" content=\"/\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nor like so in an ASP.NET Core context:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<meta name=\"blazor-base-href\" content=\"@Url.Content(\"~/\")\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting this through configuration in Startup.cs or maybe _Imports.razor are other alternatives.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24631","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Alternative to <base href=\"/\" /> to specify the root of a Blazor app\" (#24631)"},{"Id":"674554884","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-06T19:37:52","Actor":"djary","Number":"24629","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to debug some web assembly apps from visual studio 16.7.0","State":"open","Body":"hi, after update vs to 16.7.0 v, I can not debugging blazor webassembly.\r\n\r\nconsole log:\r\n\r\n`info: IdentityServer4.Startup[0]\r\n      Starting IdentityServer4 version 3.0.0.0\r\ninfo: IdentityServer4.Startup[0]\r\n      Using explicitly configured authentication scheme Identity.Application for IdentityServer\r\ninfo: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]\r\n      Now listening on: https://localhost:5001\r\ninfo: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]\r\n      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000\r\ninfo: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]\r\n      Application started.

Run the app in debug with IIS Express in Google Chrome. Navigate to the counter page by using the menu and try to duplicate the tab. There should be an unhandled exception in the new tab. If there's no exception, close Visual Studio, reopen the project and try to run it again. \r\n<!--\r\nWe ❤ code!

I am trying to make a component library for working with a mapbox from blazor. Now I have a main component  MapBoxView, that displays a map and MapboxGeocoder, wich used for finding  objects . Each of component has a procedure OnFirstAfterRenderAsync():\r\n```\r\n        protected async override Task OnFirstAfterRenderAsync()\r\n        {\r\n            await base.OnFirstAfterRenderAsync();\r\n            Dictionary<string, object> o = new Dictionary<string, object>();\r\n            ...\r\n            await JsInvokeAsync<object>(\"mapgl.mymap.initMap\", o);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n        protected async override Task OnFirstAfterRenderAsync()\r\n        {\r\n            await base.OnFirstAfterRenderAsync();\r\n            Dictionary<string, object> o = new Dictionary<string, object>();\r\n            o.Add(\"container\", container);\r\n            await JsInvokeAsync<object>(\"mapgl.mygeocoder.initGeocoder\", o);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nWhen in demo program I use code:\r\n```\r\n@page \"/\"\r\n\r\n<MapBoxView zoom=@_zoom container=@containerName mapCenter=@centerOfView>\r\n</MapBoxView>\r\n\r\n<MapBoxGeocoder Id=\"geocoder\">\r\n</MapBoxGeocoder>\r\n```\r\nthen all works fine, and I get the picture I want:\r\n![map_with_geocoder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67376268/89538152-e0b95d00-d802-11ea-87c6-1999ac59f821.png)\r\nBut when I use next code:\r\n```\r\n    <MapBoxView zoom=@_zoom container=@containerName mapCenter=@centerOfView>\r\n        <MapBoxGeocoder Id=\"geocoder\">\r\n        </MapBoxGeocoder>\r\n    </MapBoxView>\r\n\r\n```\r\nThat is, I put the nested component in the main one, then the geocoder (left bottom window with text - Search on the picture)  is not shown and  the program does not enter the procedure   OnFirstAfterRenderAsync() of MapBoxGeocoder component.\r\n   Main component MapBoxView has razor code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@namespace MapBoxBlazor\r\n\r\n@inherits BaseMapBoxView\r\n\r\n    <div id='mapContainer'>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?

ASP.net Core 3.1 is sending a Ping-Frame from the Server to the client in the defined interval from  `WebSocketOptions.KeepAliveInterval` property. So far everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nBut with a \"malicious\" client, which is not responding with a mandatory Pong-Frame, the Server just keeps sending Ping-Frames and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nAfter quickly scanning through the repo, i am afraid that there is simply nothing implemented, that checks if the client responds with a pong frame in time. To make this clear: The RFC is not defining what the other side should do, when Pong-Fames are not coming back. But it clearly states that the receiver of a Ping-Frame MUST send a Pong-Frame back. Based on that i was expecting some server-side timeout for the websocket connection (like missing three Pong-Frames terminates the connection).\r\n\r\nThis behavior currently prevents the server from detecting broken Websocket-Connections where e.G. an intermediate Router has gone away and now WebSocket Close-Frame and/or TCP FIN packet has been transmitted.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nThis is not that easily reproducable, since you need a WebSocket-Client which you can \"freeze\" without sending a Close-Frame to the server. I used Mojo::UserAgent in a perl script to connect a websocket and after a while i paused the process via CTRL+Z on the command line.\r\n\r\nI watched the network traffic via Wireshark and verified that Ping-Frames are sent and no Pong-Frames are going back anymore. The red line marks the moment when i froze the client-websocket.\r\n\r\n![https://sveneppler.de/stuff/asp-net-websocket-ping-pong.png](https://sveneppler.de/stuff/asp-net-websocket-ping-pong.png)\r\n\r\nI could provide a reproducer repo. But since to my knowledge there is just no handling in the server anyway, a reproducer would be \"useless\".\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- ASP.NET Core 3.1\r\n- Include the output of `dotnet --info`\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.301\r\n Commit:    7feb845744\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     ubuntu\r\n OS Version:  18.04\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         ubuntu.18.04-x64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/3.1.301/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.5\r\n  Commit:  65cd789777\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.807 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  2.2.402 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  3.1.301 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.19 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.8 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.19 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.8 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.5 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.19 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.8 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.5 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24614","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebSockets: No timeout associated to Ping-Pong-Frames\" (#24614)"},{"Id":"673956255","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-06T04:11:58","Actor":"davidfowl","Number":"24609","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actually fix the CopyToAsync this time ","State":"closed","Body":"- Hard code the 4K buffer length for CopyToAsync\r\n- Write a test this time :D\r\n\r\nFixes #24032\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/24609","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Actually fix the CopyToAsync this time \" (#24609)"},{"Id":"673991150","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-06T03:44:20","Actor":"johnwc","Number":"24612","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updating from 2.1 to 3.1 - HTTP Error 500.0 - ANCM In-Process Handler Load Failure","State":"open","Body":"Trying to use a [MS sample code for Azure Ad/OpenID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-aspnet-core-webapp#option-2-register-and-manually-configure-your-application-and-code-sample), I received this error when changing the version of .Net Core to 3.1.

I deleted the .vs folder thinking that the IIS Express .config file just needed to be recreated correctly for the new version because of the new InProcess module, still nothing.

I tested if that was the issue, and it seemed to fix it. Even though I had no spaces. I rename the project from `WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet` to just simply `WebApp`, low and behold it started as expected. There seems to be an issue with the length of the assembly name, as I renamed it back and changed the assembly name to be `WebApp`, and it successfully started again.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

So, starting with .NET 5 preview 7, the `.razor` compiler will omit insignificant whitespace by default.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, this will not have any effect on the visual layout of the rendered component, since the whitespace nodes being removed would not normally affect it. However, the whitespace might affect the rendered output if you are using a CSS rule like `white-space: pre`. If you need to preserve the whitespace, you can use the new directive `@preservewhitespace true` at the top of your `.razor` file, or inside an `_Imports.razor` file to apply the preference to an entire subdirectory or even your whole project.\r\n\r\nFor further discussions, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23568\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following `.razor` code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n    @foreach (var item in Items)\r\n    {\r\n        <li>\r\n            @item.Text\r\n        </li>\r\n    }\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would previously have rendered two whitespace nodes outside the `@foreach`, and then two more around the `<li>`, and then two more around `@item.Text`.

This is available starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 \r\n- A set of ciphers compatible with HTTP/2. THis is available starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\nAs such, Kestrel's behavior when HTTP/2 over TLS is configured has been changed to:\r\n- Downgrade to `Http1` and log a message at the `Information` level when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http1AndHttp2`. Note this is the default value for `ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`.\r\n- Throw a `NotSupportedException` when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http2`.\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 are considered as incompatible since they don't have the necessary ciphers by default, it is possible to update the Computer Configuration settings to use HTTP/2 compatible ciphers, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-8-1). Once configured, HTTP/2 over TLS on Kestrel must be explicitly enabled by setting the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2`, e.g. \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2\", true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that no underlying support has changed. For example, HTTP/2 over TLS has never worked on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012. The change here modifies how errors in these unsupported scenario are presented.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Error during TLS handshake     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Downgrade to Http1                    | Downgrade to Http1     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Throw NotSupportedException     | Throw NotSupportedException &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Downgrade to Http1                    | Downgrade to Http1     | Downgrade to Http1 &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured and the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2` need to be set to `true` to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is made to ensure compatibility errors for HTTP/2 over TLS on older Windows versions are surfaced as early and as clearly as possible. \r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure HTTP/2 over TLS is disabled on incompatible Windows versions.

This is already done by default for appsettings.json and appsettings.{Environment}.json.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n- [GenericHostBuilderExtensions.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(IHostBuilder, Action<IWebHostBuilder>)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.generichostbuilderextensions.configurewebhostdefaults) now calls [KestrelServerOptions.Configure(IConfiguration, bool)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.configure) with `reloadOnChange: true` by default.\r\n\r\nTo discuss this change, use the following issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/22807\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/419","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Kestrel now reacts to configuration changes by default\" (#419)"},{"Id":"631235947","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-05T00:56:04","Actor":"halter73","Number":"418","RawContent":null,"Title":"Changes to Kestrel's default supported TLS protocol versions","State":"open","Body":"## Changes to Kestrel's default supported TLS protocol versions\r\n\r\nKestrel now uses the system default TLS protocol versions rather than restricting connections to the TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 protocols like it did previously.\r\n\r\nThis allows TLS 1.3 to be used by default in environments that support it, but it also allows TLS 1.0 to be used in some environments (such as Windows Server 2016 by default) which is usually [not desirable.][1] To disable older protocols you can either do so system-wide ([Windows instructions][2]) or manually select which protocols you want to support in code as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System.Security.Authentication;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\n.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>\r\n{\r\n    webBuilder.UseKestrel(kestrelOptions =>\r\n    {\r\n        kestrelOptions.ConfigureHttpsDefaults(httpsOptions =>\r\n        {\r\n            httpsOptions.SslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12 | SslProtocols.Tls13;\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's no API to exclude specific protocols.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0.0-preview6\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nKestrel required connections use TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 by default.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nKestrel now allows the operating system to choose the best protocol to use, and to block protocols that are not secure.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nTo support TLS 1.3 and future TLS versions by default as they become available.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nUnless your app has a specific reason not to, you should use the new defaults.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you should verify your system is configured to allow only secure protocols.

In general, your previous `MapHub`/`MapConnectionHandler` calls can be transferred directly from the body of `UseSignalR`/`UseConnections` over to `UseEndpoints` with no change needed.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [SignalRAppBuilderExtensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.signalrappbuilderextensions) class\r\n\t* [UseSignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.signalrappbuilderextensions.usesignalr) method\r\n* [ConnectionsAppBuilderExtensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.connectionsappbuilderextensions) class\r\n\t* [UseConnections](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.connectionsappbuilderextensions.useconnections) method\r\n* [ConnectionsRouteBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder) class\r\n\t* [MapConnectionHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder.mapconnectionhandler) method\r\n\t* [MapConnections](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder.mapconnections) method\r\n* [HubRouteBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.hubroutebuilder) class\r\n\t* [MapHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.hubroutebuilder.maphub) method\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/412","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removed `UseSignalR`, `UseConnections` and related methods\" (#412)"},{"Id":"580166413","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-12T19:20:48","Actor":"anurse","Number":"411","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migrating dotnet/extensions content to dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"*Please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806 for discussions on this topic*\r\n\r\nAs part of the [ongoing repository consolidation effort](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119) in .NET 5, we are working to move most of the content from dotnet/extensions into other repositories. Most of these packages were developed by and are currently maintained by the ASP.NET team. However, moving forward we want to enable more scenarios with these packages, outside of ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nThe packages which we believe are usable in various application models (Configuration, DI, Hosting, etc.) are being moved to the **dotnet/runtime repository**. Packages which are primarily used in ASP.NET Core applications (Web Encoders, etc.) are moving to the **dotnet/aspnetcore repository**. Finally, in order to avoid introducing third-party dependencies into dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore, some packages are remaining in the **dotnet/extensions repository** as they have dependencies on third-party packages (such as integrations with StackExchange.Redis and other components).\r\n\r\nThe full list of packages that are moving can be found at the end of this announcement. In general, tests and samples will be moving to the relevant repo based on where the main package moved. Issue tracking for the relevant packages will also move to that repository.\r\n\r\n## PR/Issue migrations\r\n\r\nThere are 400+ open issues and ~50 open PRs (at time of writing) in dotnet/extensions.\r\n\r\nSince we are actively working on migrating the packages now, we recommend waiting to open new PRs until we update this announcement indicating the migration is complete. Some packages are building in two repositories and we want to make sure your changes land in the right place. Over the migration process, we'll be closing most of the active PRs that target packages which have been moved and asking the author to migrate the PR to the relevant repository.\r\n\r\nFor issues, feel free to continue opening them and we'll respond to them as best we can during the migration. If the package your issue relates to has been moved, we'll handle transferring the issue. We'll be doing some triaging of the incoming issues and the backlog and will attempt to migrate as many issues as possible. As part of this process, we'll also close issues that are no longer relevant, duplicates of other issues, or enhancements we don't plan to support.\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n\r\nIf your question isn't answered here, use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask it!\r\n\r\n#### Are these packages moving in to the Base Class Library (\"BCL\"), or Microsoft.NETCore.App?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to change how these components ship as part of this migration. Packages that currently ship on NuGet.org will continue to do so. Libraries that are currently included in ASP.NET Core will continue to be included. We are not adding any of these components to the BCL at this time.\r\n\r\n#### If package `Microsoft.Extensions.X` is moving to the runtime repo, why not rename it to `System.X`?\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to rename assemblies and redirect type references, it is **not** possible to change package identities, namespaces or type names in a non-breaking way. Renaming these types would be extremely disruptive and provide very little benefit. All of these components are *already* covered by the [.NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) and will continue to be in the future, just like the `System.*` assemblies.\r\n\r\n#### Will these packages still support .NET Standard 2.0?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to reduce the set of frameworks these packages can be used on as part of this migration. If they currently support .NET Standard, we have no plans to change that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why are some packages staying in dotnet/extensions?\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we want to avoid third-party dependencies in the dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore repositories. The packages that depend on third-party dependencies are remaining in dotnet/extensions to help preserve this.\r\n\r\n#### Where should I file issues related to these packages?\r\n\r\nIn general, file issues in the repo that contains the package. Some feature areas are split between multiple repos. If you're not sure, feel free to file issues in any of the three repos (dotnet/runtime, dotnet/extensions or dotnet/aspnetcore) and the team can transfer the issue as needed.\r\n\r\n#### Why did you move package `X` to repo `Y`?\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask questions about specific packages.\r\n\r\n## Package List\r\n\r\nThe following list identifies all the packages we currently ship from [dotnet/extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions) and which repo they are moving

Since ASP.NET Core SignalR users may be using this package, we want to bring this issue to the attention of all ASP.NET Core users.*\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability that affects ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability exists when using the [`MessagePack`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MessagePack/) NuGet package. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how MessagePack handles deserialization.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18716\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-runtime) or your application has a dependency on any of the packages listed in [affected packages](#affected-packages), you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-runtime\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core 2.1, 3.0 or 3.1 application using SignalR with the MessagePack Hub Protocol.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core-based application that uses any of the vulnerable packages shown below, or any ASP.NET Core application running on .NET Core 2.1.x, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMessagePack | 1.0.0 - 1.8.x | 1.9.3 *With code change described below*\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0 - 3.1.1 | *Update transitive reference to `MessagePack`*\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** MessagePack 2.x is *not compatible* with ASP.NET Core SignalR.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nFirst examine the packages you have installed. If you have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` in your package graph, you must update it. If you have a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` in your project, you likely have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` and should fix it by [directly referencing a secure version](#fixing-transitive-dependencies).\r\n\r\n**In addition to updating** you must set the `MessagePackSecurity.Active` static property to enable the `UntrustedData` mode for the MessagePack serializer, to ensure you are protected. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for details. Add the following code to the top of your app's entry point:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n  // Add the following lines\r\n  // Enable additional security in MessagePack to handle untrusted data.\r\n  MessagePackSecurity.Active = MessagePackSecurity.UntrustedData;\r\n\r\n  // Continue with program initialization...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your application provides any custom `IMessagePackFormatter<T>` implementations, you should also update them to include the relevant security measures by ensuring reads of variable-length values (such as strings) are done within a `using (MessagePackSecurity.DepthStep())` block. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for more details.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.8.80\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `MessagePack` version 1.8.80\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `MessagePack` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `MessagePack` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

In ASP.NET Core 5.0, we will move from the 1.x version to the latest 2.x version. This is a breaking change for:\r\n\r\n* Anyone who is setting/configuring values on [`MessagePackHubProtocolOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.messagepackhubprotocoloptions)\r\n* Anyone who was using the MessagePack APIs directly **and** using the ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol in the same application, as the newer version will be loaded instead of the previous version.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously, ASP.NET Core SignalR used the MessagePack 1.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNow, ASP.NET Core SignalR will use the MessagePack 2.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior will impact some aspects of message serialization and deserialization. See the [guidance for migrating from 1.x to 2.x](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md) published by the MessagePack package authors. Specifically, there are [behavioral changes to how DateTime values are serialized](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md#behavioral-changes).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe believe updating to MessagePack v2.x will add useful new functionality and allow us to stay current with the latest improvements in that package.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you are using MessagePack directly in your application **and** using the SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol, update your usage to adapt to any breaking changes in the 2.x release of MessagePack.

As targeting .NET Framework adds dependencies for various packages you must update the dependencies your application uses, recompile and redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means one of the following:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages.\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The first thing I am seeing is that whenever each SubComponent is initially created, the onclick seems to be firing. Is this normal? Or have I set something up incorrectly? The objective is to create a list of these things, then when I click on one of them, it disappears from the list, but I can't seem to get the signalling worked out.\r\n\r\nOne other odd thing I have seen as well. In attempting to figure this out, I moved my list initialization code from OnInitialized to OnAfterRender. When I do, I see that OnAfterRender is only called a single time with firstRender=true. I'm a bit confused by this as well. I'm still learning here, but I have experienced that OnInitialized, etc. are called twice during component setup with Blazor server. I assumed (but admittedly never actually tested) that since their is a firstRender bool it would be called once true and once false. If this isn't the case, what is the purpose of the bool?\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\michael>dotnet --info\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.302\r\n Commit:

polymorphism","State":"open","Body":"### What problem are you trying to solve?\r\nHere is a simplified version of what I am trying to solve.\r\n\r\nI am working on a razor component that uses a `<select>` to choose the value of a property on a tracked entity.\r\n\r\nI have a base `Dropdown` class and multiple classes that derive from it, e.g. `Color`, which is a property on the tracked entity.\r\n\r\nTo make the razor component generic enough, I pass in a `List<Dropdown>` created from a `List<Color>`.\r\n\r\nAfter the `<select>` is changed, I want to assign the new choice to the `Color` on the tracked entity.\r\n\r\nThere is no way I can find to set the `Color` property directly - razor component doesn't know it's a `Color` and no way to create a `Color` object using its type and the values from the `List<Dropdown>` corresponding to `<select>` value.\r\n\r\nWithout polymorphism support, is there a way it can be accomplished, or is it a current limitation?\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThis is an idea:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// I'm using reflection in my code, but for this example, I'm leaving it out for simplicity\r\nvar createdColor = [create a new Color

So we have moved to another approach, We completely disable a UI rendering and updates in the C# side using the ShouldRender lifecycle and add JS codes to rendering and updating the UI like below-highlighted code.\r\n\r\n[UseofJS.razor]\r\n\r\n```\r\n@page \"/UseofJS\"\r\n@*Wired mouse events*@\r\n\r\n<div @onmousemove=\"@OnMousemove\" @onmousedown=\"@OnMousedown\" @onmouseup=\"@OnMouseup\" style=\"width:700px;height:700px\">\r\n    <svg height=\"700\" width=\"700\">\r\n\r\n        @*rendered the rect elements inside the SVG element*@\r\n\r\n        @for (int i = 0; i < @Shapes.Count; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            <rect id=\"@Shapes[i].ID\" x=\"@Shapes[i].X\" y=\"@Shapes[i].Y\" height=\"50\" width=\"50\"></rect>\r\n        }\r\n    </svg>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n@code{\r\n\r\n    [Inject]\r\n    protected IJSRuntime jsRuntime { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    //created the list for shapes\r\n    List<Shape> Shapes = new List<Shape>();\r\n    bool inAction = false;\r\n    Point Diff = new Point();\r\n    Point Curr = new Point();\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnInitialized()\r\n    {\r\n        // added 500 shapes to render in SVG\r\n        Shapes = new List<Shape>();\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            Shapes.Add(new Shape() { ID = (i.ToString()), X = i * 10, Y = i * 10 }); ;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // wired mousedown event\r\n    public void OnMousedown(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.MouseEventArgs args)\r\n    {\r\n        inAction = true;\r\n        // get the current point\r\n        Curr = new Point() { X = args.ClientX, Y = args.ClientY };\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    // wired mouseup event\r\n    public void OnMouseup(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.MouseEventArgs args)\r\n    {\r\n        inAction = false;\r\n    }\r\n    // wired mousemove event\r\n    public void OnMousemove(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.MouseEventArgs args)\r\n    {\r\n        Diff = new Point() { X = args.ClientX - Curr.X, Y = args.ClientY - Curr.Y };\r\n        if (inAction)\r\n        {\r\n            // update the x and y position for shapes\r\n            Shapes[0].X += Diff.X;\r\n            Shapes[0].Y += Diff.Y;\r\n            jsRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync(\"updateUI\", new object[] { new Point() { X = Shapes[0].X, Y = Shapes[0].Y } });\r\n        }\r\n        Curr = new Point() { X = args.ClientX, Y = args.ClientY };\r\n        StateHasChanged();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Prevented the auto rendering\r\n    protected override bool ShouldRender()\r\n    {\r\n        var renderUI = false;\r\n        return renderUI;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    class Shape\r\n    {\r\n        public string ID { get; set; }\r\n        public double X { get; set; }\r\n        public double Y { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n    class Point\r\n    {\r\n        public double X { get; set; }\r\n        public double Y { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Sample.JS]\r\n\r\n```\r\nwindow.updateUI = function (pt) {\r\n    var rect = this.document.getElementById(\"1\");\r\n    rect.setAttribute('x', pt.x)\r\n    rect.setAttribute('y', pt.y)\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the second approach also we are facing more problem\r\n1.\tFor each interaction, we need to make an interop call to update UI from C# to JS. So it makes more performance delay in the server application. (when hosting it into another server machine)\r\nhttp://23.92.60.125:8123/UseofJS\r\n2.\tAlso, we need to use the mouse wheel and touch events along with I need to preventDefault actions these events like the below code. However, it does not work and it shows below error on console \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Chrome I also see the following in the console...\r\n[Intervention] Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener due to the target being treated as passive.

Please describe.\r\n\r\nRazorViewEngine being registered as a singleton limits the ability to support use cases such as applications with plugins (where a plugin may impact view resolution) and multi-tenancy (where tenants may require different view resolution). Generally speaking, singleton seems like it should be avoided where possible, as they function similar to statics, and limit applications' ability to customize behavior on a per-request basis. The registration with Singleton lifespan appears to be driven by the caching of state for the resolution of views. Currently, flushing the cache is not possible and the alternative method of clearing the cache (de-registering the RazorViewEngine and registering a new instance) quickly becomes messy as the full graph of dependents must also be re-instantiated.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWhile the ability to support the aforementioned use cases need not be part of the default implementation of RazorViewEngine, at present it is also not possible to implement cleanly in a derived classes, as the ViewLookupCache cannot be set by derived classes. Consequently, in order to support such behavior, it becomes necessary to either implement IRazorViewEngine from scratch (where 95%+ of the code is copy/pasted from RazorViewEngine) or to use reflection to modify the private field behind ViewLookupCache. This feels like a miss in terms of the balance of open vs. closed. Adding a constructor, as show in [this PR](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23889/commits/32831a849cb74764a2bcfb0f618639b34e4431c2) would allow derivations of RazorViewEngine to provide better control over caching, and to potentially inject the cache and move RazorViewEngine to Scoped lifespan (have tested).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24328","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"More flexibility for RazorViewEngine\" (#24328)"},{"Id":"665883256","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-26T23:43:18","Actor":"JamesNK","Number":"24327","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rollout T? on unconstrained type parameters","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/39877 but for aspnetcore\r\n\r\n@pranavkm ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24327","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Rollout T? on unconstrained type parameters\" (#24327)"},{"Id":"665859671","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-26T21:03:30","Actor":"igrmk","Number":"24326","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bound Dictionary<int, int> causes FormatException if no data is posted","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nBound `Dictionary<int, int>` causes `FormatException` if no data is posted\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `dotnet new webapp`\r\n2.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

So, starting with .NET 5 preview 7, the `.razor` compiler will omit insignificant whitespace by default.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, this will not have any effect on the visual layout of the rendered component, since the whitespace nodes being removed would not normally affect it. However, the whitespace might affect the rendered output if you are using a CSS rule like `white-space: pre`. If you need to preserve the whitespace, you can use the new directive `@preservewhitespace true` at the top of your `.razor` file, or inside an `_Imports.razor` file to apply the preference to an entire subdirectory or even your whole project.\r\n\r\nFor further discussions, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23568\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following `.razor` code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n    @foreach (var item in Items)\r\n    {\r\n        <li>\r\n            @item.Text\r\n        </li>\r\n    }\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would previously have rendered two whitespace nodes outside the `@foreach`, and then two more around the `<li>`, and then two more around `@item.Text`. If the list contained 100 items, this would have been 402 whitespace nodes - i.e., more than half of all nodes rendered, even though none of them would visually affect the rendered output. Eliminating them at compile time greatly improves performance for rendering and diffing.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes were preserved\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhitespace nodes are removed if:\r\n\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within an element\r\n * ... they are leading or trailing within a `RenderFragment` parameter (e.g., child content being passed to another component)\r\n * ... they precede or follow a C# code block such as an `@if`, `@foreach`, etc.\r\n\r\n... except if the `@preservewhitespace` directive is used with value `true`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nPerformance. See above.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIn most cases no action is required, as applications will typically continue to behave normally (but faster). If the whitespace stripping causes any problems for a particular component, use `@preservewhitespace true` in that component to disable this optimization.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\nBlazor\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor components now trim insignificant whitespace by default\" (#426)"},{"Id":"646581464","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-27T01:24:05","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"425","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.*, Microsoft.JSInterop.* packages will no longer target netstandard2.1","State":"open","Body":"## Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components, Microsoft.JSInterop packages no longer target netstandard2.1\r\n\r\nIn 3.2, Blazor WebAssembly applications compiled to netstandard2.1.

This is available starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 \r\n- A set of ciphers compatible with HTTP/2. THis is available starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\nAs such, Kestrel's behavior when HTTP/2 over TLS is configured has been changed to:\r\n- Downgrade to `Http1` and log a message at the `Information` level when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http1AndHttp2`. Note this is the default value for `ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`.\r\n- Throw a `NotSupportedException` when [`ListenOptions.HttpProtocols`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c4c6e25a0660ffbcae2d81c979495ec9533ccaff/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/ListenOptions.cs#L79) is set to `Http2`.\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 are considered as incompatible since they don't have the necessary ciphers by default, it is possible to update the Computer Configuration settings to use HTTP/2 compatible ciphers, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-8-1). Once configured, HTTP/2 over TLS on Kestrel must be explicitly enabled by setting the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2`, e.g. \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2\", true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that no underlying support has changed. For example, HTTP/2 over TLS has never worked on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012. The change here modifies how errors in these unsupported scenario are presented.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0 preview 7\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Error during TLS handshake     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Downgrade to Http1                    | Downgrade to Http1     | Error during TLS handshake &ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP/2 over TLS is configured:\r\n\r\n| HttpProtocols | Windows 7, <br /> Windows Server 2008 R2, <br /> or earlier | Windows 8, <br /> Windows Server 2012 | Windows 8.1, <br /> Windows Server 2012 R2 | Windows 10, <br /> Windows Server 2016, <br /> or newer |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Http2         | Throw NotSupportedException                   | Throw NotSupportedException     | Throw NotSupportedException &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n| Http1AndHttp2 | Downgrade to Http1                    | Downgrade to Http1     | Downgrade to Http1 &ast;&ast;     | No error                                 |\r\n\r\n&ast;&ast;: Compatible cipher suites need to be configured and the app context switch `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.EnableWindows81Http2` need to be set to `true` to enable these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis change is made to ensure compatibility errors for HTTP/2 over TLS on older Windows versions are surfaced as early and as clearly as possible. \r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nEnsure HTTP/2 over TLS is disabled on incompatible Windows versions.

This is already done by default for appsettings.json and appsettings.{Environment}.json.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n- [GenericHostBuilderExtensions.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(IHostBuilder, Action<IWebHostBuilder>)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.generichostbuilderextensions.configurewebhostdefaults) now calls [KestrelServerOptions.Configure(IConfiguration, bool)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.configure) with `reloadOnChange: true` by default.\r\n\r\nTo discuss this change, use the following issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/22807\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/419","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Kestrel now reacts to configuration changes by default\" (#419)"},{"Id":"631235947","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-05T00:56:04","Actor":"halter73","Number":"418","RawContent":null,"Title":"Changes to Kestrel's default supported TLS protocol versions","State":"open","Body":"## Changes to Kestrel's default supported TLS protocol versions\r\n\r\nKestrel now uses the system default TLS protocol versions rather than restricting connections to the TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 protocols like it did previously.\r\n\r\nThis allows TLS 1.3 to be used by default in environments that support it, but it also allows TLS 1.0 to be used in some environments (such as Windows Server 2016 by default) which is usually [not desirable.][1] To disable older protocols you can either do so system-wide ([Windows instructions][2]) or manually select which protocols you want to support in code as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System.Security.Authentication;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\n.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>\r\n{\r\n    webBuilder.UseKestrel(kestrelOptions =>\r\n    {\r\n        kestrelOptions.ConfigureHttpsDefaults(httpsOptions =>\r\n        {\r\n            httpsOptions.SslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12 | SslProtocols.Tls13;\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's no API to exclude specific protocols.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 5.0.0-preview6\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nKestrel required connections use TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 by default.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nKestrel now allows the operating system to choose the best protocol to use, and to block protocols that are not secure.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nTo support TLS 1.3 and future TLS versions by default as they become available.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nUnless your app has a specific reason not to, you should use the new defaults.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you should verify your system is configured to allow only secure protocols.

In general, your previous `MapHub`/`MapConnectionHandler` calls can be transferred directly from the body of `UseSignalR`/`UseConnections` over to `UseEndpoints` with no change needed.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [SignalRAppBuilderExtensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.signalrappbuilderextensions) class\r\n\t* [UseSignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.signalrappbuilderextensions.usesignalr) method\r\n* [ConnectionsAppBuilderExtensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.connectionsappbuilderextensions) class\r\n\t* [UseConnections](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.connectionsappbuilderextensions.useconnections) method\r\n* [ConnectionsRouteBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder) class\r\n\t* [MapConnectionHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder.mapconnectionhandler) method\r\n\t* [MapConnections](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder.mapconnections) method\r\n* [HubRouteBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.hubroutebuilder) class\r\n\t* [MapHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.hubroutebuilder.maphub) method\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/412","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removed `UseSignalR`, `UseConnections` and related methods\" (#412)"},{"Id":"580166413","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-12T19:20:48","Actor":"anurse","Number":"411","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migrating dotnet/extensions content to dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"*Please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806 for discussions on this topic*\r\n\r\nAs part of the [ongoing repository consolidation effort](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119) in .NET 5, we are working to move most of the content from dotnet/extensions into other repositories. Most of these packages were developed by and are currently maintained by the ASP.NET team. However, moving forward we want to enable more scenarios with these packages, outside of ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nThe packages which we believe are usable in various application models (Configuration, DI, Hosting, etc.) are being moved to the **dotnet/runtime repository**. Packages which are primarily used in ASP.NET Core applications (Web Encoders, etc.) are moving to the **dotnet/aspnetcore repository**. Finally, in order to avoid introducing third-party dependencies into dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore, some packages are remaining in the **dotnet/extensions repository** as they have dependencies on third-party packages (such as integrations with StackExchange.Redis and other components).\r\n\r\nThe full list of packages that are moving can be found at the end of this announcement. In general, tests and samples will be moving to the relevant repo based on where the main package moved. Issue tracking for the relevant packages will also move to that repository.\r\n\r\n## PR/Issue migrations\r\n\r\nThere are 400+ open issues and ~50 open PRs (at time of writing) in dotnet/extensions.\r\n\r\nSince we are actively working on migrating the packages now, we recommend waiting to open new PRs until we update this announcement indicating the migration is complete. Some packages are building in two repositories and we want to make sure your changes land in the right place. Over the migration process, we'll be closing most of the active PRs that target packages which have been moved and asking the author to migrate the PR to the relevant repository.\r\n\r\nFor issues, feel free to continue opening them and we'll respond to them as best we can during the migration. If the package your issue relates to has been moved, we'll handle transferring the issue. We'll be doing some triaging of the incoming issues and the backlog and will attempt to migrate as many issues as possible. As part of this process, we'll also close issues that are no longer relevant, duplicates of other issues, or enhancements we don't plan to support.\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n\r\nIf your question isn't answered here, use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask it!\r\n\r\n#### Are these packages moving in to the Base Class Library (\"BCL\"), or Microsoft.NETCore.App?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to change how these components ship as part of this migration. Packages that currently ship on NuGet.org will continue to do so. Libraries that are currently included in ASP.NET Core will continue to be included. We are not adding any of these components to the BCL at this time.\r\n\r\n#### If package `Microsoft.Extensions.X` is moving to the runtime repo, why not rename it to `System.X`?\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to rename assemblies and redirect type references, it is **not** possible to change package identities, namespaces or type names in a non-breaking way. Renaming these types would be extremely disruptive and provide very little benefit. All of these components are *already* covered by the [.NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) and will continue to be in the future, just like the `System.*` assemblies.\r\n\r\n#### Will these packages still support .NET Standard 2.0?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to reduce the set of frameworks these packages can be used on as part of this migration. If they currently support .NET Standard, we have no plans to change that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why are some packages staying in dotnet/extensions?\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we want to avoid third-party dependencies in the dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore repositories. The packages that depend on third-party dependencies are remaining in dotnet/extensions to help preserve this.\r\n\r\n#### Where should I file issues related to these packages?\r\n\r\nIn general, file issues in the repo that contains the package. Some feature areas are split between multiple repos. If you're not sure, feel free to file issues in any of the three repos (dotnet/runtime, dotnet/extensions or dotnet/aspnetcore) and the team can transfer the issue as needed.\r\n\r\n#### Why did you move package `X` to repo `Y`?\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask questions about specific packages.\r\n\r\n## Package List\r\n\r\nThe following list identifies all the packages we currently ship from [dotnet/extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions) and which repo they are moving

Since ASP.NET Core SignalR users may be using this package, we want to bring this issue to the attention of all ASP.NET Core users.*\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability that affects ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability exists when using the [`MessagePack`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MessagePack/) NuGet package. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how MessagePack handles deserialization.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18716\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-runtime) or your application has a dependency on any of the packages listed in [affected packages](#affected-packages), you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-runtime\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core 2.1, 3.0 or 3.1 application using SignalR with the MessagePack Hub Protocol.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core-based application that uses any of the vulnerable packages shown below, or any ASP.NET Core application running on .NET Core 2.1.x, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMessagePack | 1.0.0 - 1.8.x | 1.9.3 *With code change described below*\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0 - 3.1.1 | *Update transitive reference to `MessagePack`*\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** MessagePack 2.x is *not compatible* with ASP.NET Core SignalR.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nFirst examine the packages you have installed. If you have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` in your package graph, you must update it. If you have a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` in your project, you likely have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` and should fix it by [directly referencing a secure version](#fixing-transitive-dependencies).\r\n\r\n**In addition to updating** you must set the `MessagePackSecurity.Active` static property to enable the `UntrustedData` mode for the MessagePack serializer, to ensure you are protected. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for details. Add the following code to the top of your app's entry point:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n  // Add the following lines\r\n  // Enable additional security in MessagePack to handle untrusted data.\r\n  MessagePackSecurity.Active = MessagePackSecurity.UntrustedData;\r\n\r\n  // Continue with program initialization...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your application provides any custom `IMessagePackFormatter<T>` implementations, you should also update them to include the relevant security measures by ensuring reads of variable-length values (such as strings) are done within a `using (MessagePackSecurity.DepthStep())` block. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for more details.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.8.80\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `MessagePack` version 1.8.80\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `MessagePack` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `MessagePack` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

In ASP.NET Core 5.0, we will move from the 1.x version to the latest 2.x version. This is a breaking change for:\r\n\r\n* Anyone who is setting/configuring values on [`MessagePackHubProtocolOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.messagepackhubprotocoloptions)\r\n* Anyone who was using the MessagePack APIs directly **and** using the ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol in the same application, as the newer version will be loaded instead of the previous version.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously, ASP.NET Core SignalR used the MessagePack 1.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNow, ASP.NET Core SignalR will use the MessagePack 2.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior will impact some aspects of message serialization and deserialization. See the [guidance for migrating from 1.x to 2.x](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md) published by the MessagePack package authors. Specifically, there are [behavioral changes to how DateTime values are serialized](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md#behavioral-changes).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe believe updating to MessagePack v2.x will add useful new functionality and allow us to stay current with the latest improvements in that package.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you are using MessagePack directly in your application **and** using the SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol, update your usage to adapt to any breaking changes in the 2.x release of MessagePack.

As targeting .NET Framework adds dependencies for various packages you must update the dependencies your application uses, recompile and redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means one of the following:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages.\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

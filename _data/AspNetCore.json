have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe spec I'm using uses a [specification extension](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#specification-extensions) under [path item objects](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#path-item-object).\r\n\r\nWhen I run a build after adding an OpenAPI Reference, NewtonSoft throws an exception when it hits this extension. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAs OpenAPI allows for specification extensions, the tooling to process a spec should quietly ignore any extension is doesn't know about. Therefore the client generation should succeed.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn this repo (which is not an asp.net application, it's a simple console app) you will find an OpenAPI spec with the key `x-visibility` under `/pets` path. \r\n\r\nThis should be allowed but your parser complains.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet build\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 17.1.1+a02f73656 for .NET\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

A `ValidationAttribute` that isn't a `RequiredAttribute` only kicks in if the property value isn't null. In other words, the `CompareAttribute` only works if both properties have a value.\r\n\r\nIn my case I want to check if the other property has a certain value (true/false/etc.). If so, the actual property is required. See the code example below.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class RequiredIfTrueAttribute : RequiredAttribute\r\n{\r\n    public RequiredIfTrueAttribute(string otherProperty)\r\n    {\r\n        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(otherProperty);\r\n\r\n        OtherProperty = otherProperty;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public string OtherProperty { get; private set; }\r\n\r\n    protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)\r\n    {\r\n        var otherPropertyInfo = validationContext.ObjectType.GetProperty(OtherProperty);\r\n        if (otherPropertyInfo == null)\r\n        {\r\n            throw new MissingMemberException($\"Property '{OtherProperty}' doesn't exist.\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        object otherPropertyValue = otherPropertyInfo.GetValue(validationContext.ObjectInstance, null);\r\n        if (!Equals(true, otherPropertyValue))\r\n        {\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return base.IsValid(value, validationContext);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `otherPropertyValue` is always null. The `ObjectInstance` is the PageModel. All the properties of the model are null or default in the `ObjectInstance`.\r\n\r\nThe custom attribute is used in a PageModel like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[BindProperties]\r\npublic class CreateModel : PageModel\r\n{\r\n    [RequiredIfTrue(nameof(RequireDescription), ErrorMessage = \"{0} is required.\")]\r\n    public string Description { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public bool RequireDescription { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public IActionResult OnPost()\r\n    {\r\n        if (!ModelState.IsValid)\r\n        {\r\n            return Page();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return Page();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nModel validation comes after model binding. The `ValidationContext` `ObjectInstance` must contain the model with the binded properties and have property values.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\nnet6.0\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41582","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"PageModel ValidationContext ObjectInstance missing property values\" (#41582)"},{"Id":"1229493112","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-09T11:56:50","Actor":"lonix1","Number":"41580","RawContent":null,"Title":"Target html and body tags in css isolated files","State":"closed","Body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\nI originally posted on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/72161251/9971404).\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI'm using \"css isolation\" with RazorPages.\r\n\r\nI have a `_Layout.cshtml` and `_Layout.cshtml.css`.

I have a Blazor component `LifePointDetail.razor` which is embedded into a Leaflet popup as a [Blazor Custom Element](https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs/tree/main/src/BlazorCustomElements):\r\n```js\r\nlet marker = L.marker([latitude, longitude]);\r\nmarker.bindPopup(\"<life-point-detail></life-point-detail>\");\r\nmarker.addTo(leafletMap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works fine so far, but I'm stumbling across an issue which I don't know how to solve: Leaflet popups have the ability to automatically pan the map when opening a popup ([see docu](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#popup-autopan)). But in conjunction with my Blazor Custom Element, this doesn't work. Please see the following screenshot to better understand the problem:  \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4560672/167306291-011d3b54-b6f6-4163-a81d-afae89fb96a4.png)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nInstead, it should look like this after clicking the marker and opening the popup:  \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4560672/167306280-6b5be58c-4015-4ee7-8db8-f8d1bd83b16e.png)\r\n\r\nPlease note that in a vanilla Leaflet application, you don't have to pan manually: the popup automatically gets centered in the middle so that it is completely visible.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

This allows components to resolve parameters from a DI container using constructor injection. Constructor injection is supported in addition to property injection that is already supported via the `InjectAttribute`.\r\n\r\nFor most existing applications, this change is not discernable. However, this may be a breaking change for libraries or applications that provided non-empty constructors for components where parameters are not meant to be resolved from the DI container.\r\n\r\nFor questions or further discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40405\n\n### Version\n\n.NET 7\n\n### Previous behavior\n\nIn the ordinary case, components do not specify a constructor or have a parameter-less constructor and this is a non-breaking change. However, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyMultipleConstructorComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent () { }\r\n\r\n   public MyMultipleConstructorComponent (int someValue) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn .NET 6 and earlier, the parameter-less constructor would be used to instantiate the component.\n\n### New behavior\n\nIn .NET 7, parameters in a component are resolved from the DI container. Consider this component:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyComponent : ComponentBase\r\n{\r\n   public MyComponent(IMyService myService) { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting in .NET 7, `IMyService` is resolved from the container while instantiating the component. Using `[InjectAttribute]` to property inject services remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nGoing back to `MyMultipleConstructorComponent` from the earlier section - in .NET 7, `ActivatorUtilities` defaults to using the constructor with the most parameters to instantiate an object. In this case, the constructor with the single `int` parameter will be attempted to be resolved from the DI container and a runtime exception will be thrown if parameters are not resolvable.   \n\n### Type of breaking change\n\n- [X] **Binary incompatible**: Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load/execute or different run-time behavior.\n- [ ] **Source incompatible**: Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime/component/SDK, such as compile errors or different run-time behavior.\n\n### Reason for change\n\nConstructor injection was a popular request from Blazor users.\n\n### Recommended action\n\nIf this change severely impacts your ability to migrate your apps to .NET 7, please let us know in the associated discussion thread and we would be happy to reconsider this change.

This experience is going to focus on decoupling the frontend from the backend into two separate projects. For details here.

Sometime after we shipped, the IdentityServer team made [an announcement changing the license for future versions of IdentityServer](https://leastprivilege.com/2020/10/01/the-future-of-identityserver/) to a reciprocal public license – a license where the code is still open source but if used for commercial purposes then a paid license must be bought. This type of approach is common in the open-source world, where sustaining an income is difficult as your project becomes your full-time work.\r\n\r\nTwo of the reasons behind the choice to ship IdentityServer was the community’s well-expressed desire that we did not compete with an established open-source project and IdentityServer’s deep knowledge of the identity space. The .NET team are not OAuth and OIDC experts as we focus on providing building blocks for your application and a starting point from which you can be successful. Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

Optionally, captured the new returned `IDisposable` and dispose it if you later wish to undo the effects of the call.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[EditContextDataAnnotationsExtensions.AddDataAnnotationsValidation(EditContext)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.forms.editcontextdataannotationsextensions.adddataannotationsvalidation?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/458","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting AddDataAnnotationsValidation and replacing with EnableDataAnnotationsValidation\" (#458)"},{"Id":"848690041","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T18:24:35","Actor":"BrennanConroy","Number":"457","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Java Client updated to RxJava3","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nThis issue template is for use in opening issues that document breaking changes.

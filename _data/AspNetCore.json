Created a new diagnostic description (ASP0011). \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe analyzer tracks class declarations and if a class is in a set of categories (controller, filter, razor page, signalr hub), the analyzer scans members of the class in attempt to find 'async void' statement on a member declaration. The members are filtered and only methods are processed. The analyzer scans all methods (disregarding their access modyfier, virtuality, etc.) in classes that belong to controllers, signalr hubs, and implementations of non-async filters. In case the class belongs to the razor page, only handler-like methods are scanned (to this category relate methods that follow a pattern 'On + HTTP method'.\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n\r\n* Startup.Configure/ConfigureServices is not covered within this PR. I'd appreciate suggestions on how the Startup class should be detected. Currently I see 2 options. The first one, very simple and straightforward, lookup the class by its' name and if it or one of ancestors contains a 'Startup' part in its' name, and additionally the Configure/ConfigureServices methods are present, then start 'async void' detection process. The second option is to detect an operation with the kind of the 'OperationKind.Invocation', if this is UseStartup method invocation, fetch a generic type passed and analyze this type on having 'async void' in a method declaration. Though the second option looks more reliable I doubt it is feasible.\r\n* In either case, should the analyzer for the Startup class be present in this PR or it's possible to create a standalone later?\r\n* With this PR only 4 HTTP mehods are considered to be valid in scope of Razor Pages (these are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE). The method names are checked to follow the pattern 'On + HTTP method'. Should this list be extended and cover all existing?\r\n* Should the analyzer consider all methods that are declared in a class that implements an I*Filter interface? Or it should track only methods that are implementation of the interface?\r\n* The PR doesn't introduce a code fix for the analyzer. Is it required in this situation? If yes, could the code fix be provided in another PR?\r\n\r\nFixes #28217 (not completely, see questions)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/40165","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add analyzer to detect async void usage\" (#40165)"},{"Id":"1133229870","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-11T22:46:34","Actor":"daviddesmet","Number":"40164","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow customizing the cookie consent value","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWe welcome API proposals!

Unfortunately, given the [nature of the event](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42914045) adding support for it that uses browser intrinsic is going to be difficult / impossible. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/24417/ attempted to solve this by hijacking browser navigation and managing it via Blazor. This is a fairly involved solution, with possible significant perf overhead, and we'd like to determine if using a narrower solution would suffice here.\r\n\r\nA popular theme in the issue focused on preventing navigation to avoid losing unsaved changes in a component. A well-upvoted comment provides a sample for just this - https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/Blazr.Demo.EditForm/tree/master/Blazr.NavigationLocker. This spec is a way to determine if this is something we could get away with.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\n* Most popular issue for Blazor at the time of writing.\r\n\r\n## In-scope\r\n\r\n* Add an API that allows components to prevent navigation in a platform-independent way.\r\n* Provide turnkey solution that integrates with EditForm\r\n\r\n##  Out-of-scope\r\n\r\n* Not a general purpose location changing event handler.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe introduce an API on `NavigationManager` that allows users to confirm when a navigation is to occur.`AddNavigationConfirmationAsync` returns an `IAsyncDisposable` which prompts for a confirmation until the returned value is disposed.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\npublic class NavigationManager\r\n{\r\n+   public ValueTask<IAsyncDisposable> AddNavigationConfirmationAsync(string message, CancellationToken cancellationToken);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's an example of it in use:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n@inject NavigationManager Nav\r\n\r\n<form @oninput=\"OnInput\" @onvalidsubmit=\"OnSubmit\">\r\n    ...\r\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\r\n</form>\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    IAsyncDisposable? _navigationConfirmation;\r\n\r\n    async Task OnInput()\r\n    {\r\n        _navigationConfirmation ??= await Nav.AddNavigationConfirmationAsync(\"Are you sure you want to exit without saving?\");\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    async Task OnSubmit() => await RemoveNavigationConfirmationAsync();\r\n\r\n    ValueTask IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync() => RemoveNavigationConfirmationAsync();\r\n    \r\n    ValueTask ClearConfirmationAsync() => await (_navigationConfirmation?.DisposeAsync() ?? default);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementation relies on [window.confirm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm) for a navigation that is handled via Blazor's routing and [beforeunload event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event) for all other navigation. The `message` parameter is used as part of the `confirm` dialog, but is likely to be ignored by the unload event since browsers do not consistently support specifying it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, we introduce a `LockNavigationWhenDirty` component that uses `EditContext`'s dirty state (`IsModified() / `MarkAsUnmodified()`) to add / remove navigation confirmations. Here is what this component looks like:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class LockNavigationWhenDirty : IAsyncDisposable\r\n{\r\n    public LockNavigationWhenDirty(NavigationManager navigationManager);\r\n    [EditorRequired, Parameter] public string Message { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n```razor\r\n<EditForm ... @onvalidsubmit=\"OnValidSubmit\">\r\n    <LockNavigationWhenDirty /> \r\n    ...\r\n</EditForm>\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    async OnValidSubmit()\r\n    {\r\n        // Save content\r\n        repository.SaveAsync(..);\r\n        \r\n        // Release the lock now that we're satisfied\r\n        editContext.MarkAsUnmodified();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40149","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Add support for confirming navigations\" (#40149)"},{"Id":"1132892184","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-11T17:29:25","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"40148","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make InputRadioGroup preserve child elements","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #31610 and #39145, and supersedes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/39208\r\n\r\n@MariovanZeist - thanks so much for contributing #39208. I hope you don't mind me coming up with a slightly different solution in this PR. The reasons I wanted to do it differently are:\r\n\r\n * The approach in #39208 is to create a custom system of registering for notification to be re-rendered when an ancestor changes. This happens to be equivalent to what CascadingValue does natively when `IsFixed` is false, so simply by removing the `IsFixed=true` we get the desired behavior without needing a new mechanism.\r\n * There isn't really any perf drawback to removing the IsFixed=true. Descendants have to be notified to re-render one way or another, because their actual output must change if they become (de)selected. Prior to this fix, the mechanism used `@key` to recreate the entire child hierarchy every time, whereas now it retains the child hierarchy and just triggers the appropriate re-rendering.\r\n\r\nThe fix could have been reduced to removing these two lines from `InputRadioGroup`:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n        builder.SetKey(_context);\r\n        builder.AddAttribute(1, \"IsFixed\", true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in this PR I also chose to reduce allocations by not creating a new `InputRadioContext` on every render, and instead retaining the existing instance and mutating it in place. It's not particularly complicated to do that but did add quite a few extra changes to the PR diff.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, this produces the desired behavior and works as well as the PR at #39208. I verified that it also passes the E2E tests supplied in that PR.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Creating and sustaining an authentication server is a full-time endeavor, and Microsoft already has a team and a product in that area, Azure Active Directory, which allows 500,000 objects for free. The ASP.NET team feels a managed cloud solution remains the best practical option for developers – the security is managed, you don’t store credentials locally with the risks that presents, and new features like passwordless authentication appear seamlessly in your authentication workflow. However, we also realize that a cloud solution can be impossible for some customers due to regulatory or data sovereignty concerns.\r\n\r\nFor .NET 6 we will continue to ship IdentityServer in our templates, using the new RPL licensed version. We continue to think this is the most mature option for creating self-deployed, locally hosted token service with ASP.NET Core. We will make the licensing requirement clear if you are using a template that includes Duende IdentityServer. The [new Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) continues to be open source, but now has a dual license. This license allows it to be used for free for development, testing, and learning, free for non-commercial open source, and free for use in commercial settings if the entity or organization makes less than 1 million USD/year. The license requires [a fee](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) to be used in used in a commercial setting if the entity or organization makes more than 1M USD/year. The previous version of IdentityServer will continue to be supported for as long as .NET 5 is supported, until [around February 2022](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).\r\n\r\nFor .NET 7 we will investigate if we can build tooling to allow development and testing of OIDC (OpenID Connect) enabled applications when disconnected from the internet. You will always be free to choose whatever identity system is best for you in production by updating a few lines of code when you’re ready to go live. We’re committed to giving you options for production identity systems now and going forward.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of this announcement can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32494","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 6 and Authentication Servers\" (#464)"},{"Id":"878150269","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T22:51:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"463","RawContent":null,"Title":"Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## Actions returning IAsyncEnumerable<> are no longer buffered by MVC when using System.Text.Json\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, MVC added support for output formatting `IAsyncEnumerable<>` types by buffering the sequence in memory and formatting the buffered collection.

The options `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` no longer exist, and some additional options now exist.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously to use the MessagePack hub protocol in the browser you needed to include 3 script references\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/msgpack5/msgpack5.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr-protocol-msgpack.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition the `msgpack5` package was downloaded to your `node_modules` so you could use it in your app if you wanted.\r\n\r\n`MessagePackOptions` had `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` properties, but doesn't anymore.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nTo use the MessagePack hub protocol in the browser you now only need 2 script references\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"~/lib/signalr/signalr-protocol-msgpack.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you will have the `@msgpack/msgpack` package downloaded to your `node_modules` if you want to use the directly in your app.\r\n\r\n`MessagePackOptions` has new properties and removed the `disableTimestampEncoding` and `forceFloat64` properties.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nReduced asset size, reduced complexity to consume the package, and more customizability.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you were previously using `msgpack5` in your app, you will need to add a direct reference to the library in your package.json.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nRemoved `MessagePackOptions.disableTimestampEncoding`\r\nRemoved `MessagePackOptions.forceFloat64`\r\n\r\n### Discussion issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30471\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/454","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Changed MessagePack library in @microsoft/signalr-protocol-msgpack javascript library\" (#454)"},{"Id":"814357042","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T11:05:37","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"453","RawContent":null,"Title":"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName","State":"open","Body":"## WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\r\n\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.WebEventDescriptor` class is part of Blazor's internal protocol for communicating events from JavaScript into .NET. This class is not typically used by application code. It is typically used only by platform authors.\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.0, the `EventArgsType` property on `WebEventDescriptor` is being replaced by a new property called `EventName`. This will not affect any typical application code as it is only a detail of the low-level platform implementation.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n6.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe property `EventArgsType` described a nonstandard, Blazor-specific category name for groups of DOM event types. For example, the `click` and `mousedown` events were both mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `mouse`. Similarly, `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` events were all mapped to an `EventArgsType` value of `clipboard`. These category names were used to determine the .NET type to use for deserializing the incoming event args data.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe new property `EventName` simply specifies the original name of the event, for example `click`, `mousedown`, `cut`, `copy`, or `paste`. There is no longer a need to supply a Blazor-specific category name, so the old property `EventArgsType` is removed.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nIn PR [#29993](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/29993) we have introduced support for custom event arguments classes. As part of this, we no longer rely on all events fitting into a predefined set of categories. The framework now only needs to know the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplication code should not be affected in any way and does not need to change.\r\n\r\nAnyone building a custom Blazor rendering platform may need to update their mechanism for dispatching events into the `Renderer`, replacing any hardcoded rules they had before about event categories with simpler logic that supplies the original, raw event name.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendertree.webeventdescriptor.eventargstype?view=aspnetcore-5.0)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WebEventDescriptor.EventArgsType replaced by WebEventDescriptor.EventName\" (#453)"},{"Id":"802371479","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-05T18:11:56","Actor":"Pilchie","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disabling GitHub Discussions tab for dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"## Rationale\r\n\r\nSince we enabled GitHub Discussions, we've found them quite hard to manage for a repository the size of aspnetcore.

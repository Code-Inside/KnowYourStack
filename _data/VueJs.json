In `child` add `parent` both for `extends` as well as `components`. \r\n\r\nIn `parent` add a (boolean)-flag, say `condition`, as `data` and initialize it with `true` (thus making it reactive). In the template of `parent` add some conditional content with `v-if` based on `condition`. For debugging purposes you could also add a `watch` on `condition`. Now add a button both to `child` and `parent` with a click-handler inverting the value of `condition`. In both cases `watch` in `parent` is invoked with the correct state but only the click-handler in `parent` actually causes the template to update accordingly.\r\n\r\nCan also be reproduced using class-components and typescript.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nChanges to a reactive property in a parent-component should affect the parent-template regardless of whether the change has been triggered from the parent or the child component.\r\n\r\nOr at least if changes from a child on a parent-property are not working the `watcher` on parent should not be invoked.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOnly changes caused by the parent itself are reflected on the template.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSince the changes are at least \"visible\" using a watcher you could of course handle the required ui-changes yourself by using this.$el.findElementBy... and the `remove()` the element (if it can be removed from the DOM) or add a class/style with `display: none;` or `display: inline|block;` respectively.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Clone my github repository at: https://github.com/MaxiMilli/bug-report.git\r\n2. Main focus of this bugreport lies on `HelloWorld.vue` in the CSS animation with the name `e2***`\r\n3. Build the project and open the `dist/css/app.xxxxx.css` in your editor/IDE\r\n4. Serve the project and open the page\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI expect in both situations (build and serve) that the svg-animation with the name 'e2' works. The yellow square in the circle should move upwards when the mouse pointer is hovered (and starts again, when again hovered).\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe serve situation works perfectly fine. The hover and the animation is working.\r\nThe build situation on the other hand is not working. On hover is nothing happend. I found in the `dist/css/app.xxxxx.css` when I chose an animation name wich starts with `e2***` the build sequence replaces the `e2` in the `animation: e2 3s linear;` call with `NaN`. Even if the name is longer and starts with `e2***` (* = placeholder). If I scope the css nothing changes to the bug.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI ran into this bug, because i generated the svg-animations with a webtool. the tool generates random names for animations and two out of ten animations won't work. i (luckily) discovered, that both animation names starts with `e2*`. I fixed the bugs with a replacement of `e2` with `a2`.\r\nThank you for your work, vue is awesome!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, if you are looking at data in a route/component, and that data needs to be replaced/reloaded, you are stuck in a difficult situation. Either you need to reload the entire page/app, navigate away and then back to the route, or setup overly complex logic to modify potentially deeply nested object properties in place (Which is largely unfeasible if you have to do this for hundreds of different routes...).\r\n\r\nThe solution? Simply reloading the current route as if it was being navigated to. This triggers all the route guards, triggers all the data fetching, triggers all the props assignments, and sets up the component(s) fresh as they need to be. \r\n\r\nBack in AngularJS days, this made completely refreshing a route and it's data beyond simple, as all the navigation triggers & guards have the logic to handle data getting & assignment. KISS in it's finest.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that vue router has no support for re-navigating/reloading the current route. It requires hacks or extensive workarounds, most of which directly impact user experience.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nUnsure.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of misc discussions about this, for years, all of which have been shut down.

The code that produces the error is `var newStack = error.stack.split('\\n');`. `error.stack` is `undefined`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction createRouterError (from, to, type, message) {\r\n  var error = new Error(message);\r\n  error._isRouter = true;\r\n  error.from = from;\r\n  error.to = to;\r\n  error.type = type;\r\n\r\n  var newStack = error.stack.split('\\n');\r\n  newStack.splice(1, 2); // remove 2 last useless calls\r\n  error.stack = newStack.join('\\n');\r\n  return error\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn chrome, it has the value of the stack property.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn IE, the stack property is undefined.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the following reference documentation, the stack property is called a non-standard property.\r\n\r\nError.prototype.stack (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/stack)\r\n\r\n> **Non-standard**\r\n> This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track.

But the watch i have for state variable 'newMEssage' is called only for third message . This is happening when we have three consecutive calls to 'setNewMessage' action. But if i have three consecutive calls to 'setNewMessage' from three different components it works fine or even from single component when there is delay\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Right now the use of [generic parameter defaults](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-3.html#generic-parameter-defaults) in helper.d.ts only requires Typescript 2.3._\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the typings of `Store`. Right now, given code like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet moduleC = {\r\n    state() {\r\n        return {\r\n            valueC: -13\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet moduleA = {\r\n    state() {\r\n        return ({\r\n            valueA: \"6\",\r\n        })\r\n    },\r\n    modules: {\r\n        c: moduleC,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet moduleB = {\r\n    state: {\r\n        a: 36,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n    state: () => ({\r\n        foo: 6\r\n    }),\r\n    modules: {\r\n        a: moduleA,\r\n        b: moduleB,\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould result in the type of `store.state` to only consider the local state in the root. Also `store.state` would be typed as a function and not as its return type. With this PR the type of `store.state` will correspond to\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    foo: number;\r\n    a: {\r\n        valueA: string;\r\n        c: {\r\n            valueC: number;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    b: {\r\n        a: number;\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nWe provided defaults for new generics, therefore one should be able to still use the types as before.\r\n\r\n### About older TS versions\r\nThere seems to be a strange bug in older versions of Typescript. Sometimes the type of a store differs depending on wheather you use the `{ state() { return {...}}, ... }` or the `{ state: () => ({...}), ... }` syntax. Its not that much of a problem though. We tested the typings in 2.8.4 and the only thing that happens was that the properties are missing, but TS does not throw an error (as long as you don't try to access one of these properties) In newer versions of Typescript everything is fine.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1797","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support modules and state functions in Store typings\" (#1797)"},{"Id":"653914558","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T09:43:48","Actor":"ohdnf","Number":"1795","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix link typo in Korean README","State":"closed","Body":"Remove duplicated parenthesis of link to \"Scrimba\" in Korean README markdown file.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1795","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix link typo in Korean README\" (#1795)"},{"Id":"653096417","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T08:25:15","Actor":"zaffsite","Number":"1794","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vuex data remains undefined when called in private/incognito mode","State":"closed","Body":"**Version**\r\n3.1.1\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nHard to explain and reproduce, only in incognito mode with Firefox 78.0.1, for a few reasons, it doesn't always happen.\r\n\r\n**What is expected?**\r\nData cannot be undefined because a default data has associated them, but remains undefined, or it is a setter problem.\r\n\r\n**What is actually happening?**\r\nSome data are and stay undefined.\r\n\r\nNo problem in normal navigation mode.\r\nHas anyone ever had this problem ?\r\n\r\nThanks","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1794","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Vuex data remains undefined when called in private/incognito mode\" (#1794)"},{"Id":"651089103","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T17:24:04","Actor":"samuelgozi","Number":"1793","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix code inconsistencies","State":"closed","Body":"I fixed some code inconsistencies in the English documentation.\r\nPlease let me know if ane changes are needed.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1793","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix code inconsistencies\" (#1793)"},{"Id":"650694251","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-04T03:17:41","Actor":"mattnathan","Number":"1792","RawContent":null,"Title":"Slow registerModule when the module has getters","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n3.5.1\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://jsfiddle.net/qaL8f36y/](https://jsfiddle.net/qaL8f36y/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n0.

There were repeated warning in the console `[Violation] 'setTimeout' handler took 1552ms` where the time was increasing each time, which I took to mean something wasn't linear/constant time. I finally took the time to create a minimal reproduction but found the issue was present without Vue/Vuex devtools open, though the numbers needed to crash the browser were larger without devtools.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

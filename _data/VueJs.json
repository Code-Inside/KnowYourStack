Also, a change would need to be approved in `vue-router` as well for the memory leak there to even go away (see https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2606), and that might get fixed by other means, so this might not be worth doing anything with if that doesn't also get approved.\r\n\r\nBecause we're in control of when the app is created in SSR it didn't seem like there was any other sensible option but to give us control of when to clean it up, though maybe something can be done based on `runInNewContext`.

So it seems like I'm asking for a regression.\r\n\r\nI tried to find what formed the basis for making such a decision (to resolve them before props and data) but I haven't been able to find any related issue.\r\n\r\nI have a component `<tree-view>` that renders another component called `<tree-item>` inside. The `tree-item` may itself recursively render one or more `tree-view`s.\r\n\r\nThe `tree-view` accepts a number of options that I pass to it as props (let it be a sole option called \"mode\" for the sake of brevity):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<tree-view\r\n    mode=\"folders\"\r\n>\r\n    ...\r\n</tree-view>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `tree-view` accepts it as a prop:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nprops: {\r\n    mode: {\r\n        default: \"all\",\r\n        validator: ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I want to provide it to all the nested `tree-view`'s, so that I don't have to pass this option to the nested `tree-item` so that *only from there* it can be passed to the nested `tree-view`. But I can't do so because **the props since 2.2.1 are initialized after the injected properties**.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThat is what I'm trying to achieve\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nprops: {\r\n    mode: {\r\n        default: \"all\"\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n\r\nprovide() {\r\n    return {\r\n        /*\r\n            This one works OK, this.mode is taken from the `props`\r\n        */\r\n        mode: this.mode\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n\r\ninject: {\r\n    mode: {\r\n        /*\r\n            But this one doesn't since the `props` are not yet initialized\r\n        */\r\n        default: this.mode\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy point is that the root `tree-view` isn't provided with the `mode` injected property (because it's the root one obviously) so the warning \"Injection \"mode\" not found\" is thrown for each root `tree-view`. But all the nested `tree-view`'s *are* provided with the injected property \"mode\" so the provided value is taken instead of the `default` one.\r\n\r\nMay be (I'm not sure, just a guess) the proposed API will need to like something like\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ninject() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's that the `injected` property can accept a function as its value instead of just an array or an object.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

If a validator function throws an error, use it as a custom message for prop validation. Also, allow `{{name}}` interpolation in error message. So the `email` can be defined as:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n...\r\n  props: {\r\n    email: {\r\n      validator(value) {\r\n        if (!value.endsWith('@gmail.com')) throw new Error('the prop '{{name}}' should be a valid GMail address.')\r\n        return true\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Is there reason to have this inconsistency?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem occurs when you try to watch getters\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\nwatch: {\r\n  '$store.state.user.name': {\r\n    handler(name) {\r\n      console.log(name)\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  '$store.getters[user/fullName]': { // not working\r\n    handler(fullName) {\r\n      console.log(fullName)\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCurrent solution Is to use mapGetters() helper for getters only. Why? because of weird api.\r\nPlease note that we try to avoid mapGetters, mapState helpers... due to explicitly in large app\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdd api for getters same as is for state.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`$store.gettters.user.fullName`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

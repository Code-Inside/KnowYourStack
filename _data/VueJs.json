That means the convenience is unavailable for computed properties that rely on Vuex state and methods that dispatch Vuex actions, which is a big limitation.\r\n\r\n- It requires tight coupling of components to Vuex modules, which I've found doesn't scale well to large apps. Instead, I've found it very useful to _never_ use the `mapXXX` helpers directly in my components, but in a [state helpers file](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/blob/master/src/state/helpers.js), which describes the public interfaces for all Vuex modules. From this file, I'll import the concerns I care about into individual components. For example:\r\n  ```js\r\n  import {\r\n    authComputed,\r\n    notificationsComputed,\r\n    notificationsMethods,\r\n    searchMethods,\r\n  } from '@state/helpers'\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...authComputed,\r\n    ...notificationsComputed,\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...notificationsMethods,\r\n    ...searchMethods,\r\n  },\r\n  ```\r\n  This prevents verbose and duplicated `mapXXX` code in components, replaced by a nice list of the global concerns this component cares about. But the benefit _really_ comes in when adding new state/getters/actions or when refactoring a Vuex module. For example, if I add a new `userLoggedIn` getter to `authComputed`, it will automatically be available in any component using `authComputed`. Or, if I rename some state or split it out into additional modules, the state helpers file allows the refactor to be done in two steps: first on the Vuex side, while updating the state helpers for compatibility, _then_ in my components (if I actually want the public interface to change as well).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I feel like the `mapXXX` helpers should stay and the scoped slot pattern should actually be avoided.

When removing hundreds or thousands of links from the page, this cost is noticeable, especially on slow devices. The goal is a cost of `O(N)`.\r\n\r\nHundreds or thousands of links might seem too much, but sure there might be some cases where it makes sense, like an infinite scroll or some big grids. In many cases [vue-virtual-scroller][vue-virtual-scroller] should solve the general problem, but I think it would be better not to require it as a rule.\r\n\r\nRemoving the dependency on `$route` means effectively disabling reactivity for the RouterLink and thus all the related features. At this moment, I think the only affected features are the CSS classes to show a link is active.\r\n\r\n**Why this cost?**\r\n\r\nThe singleton `_route` is created for the `_routerRoot` [once][route-react]. At this moment, Vue instantiates a Dep to track writes and reads on this attribute.\r\n\r\nEach time a RouterLink is created, its render Watcher detects the `$route` [is accessed][route-render], so that the Watcher adds the Dep to its dependencies (`Watcher.deps`) and the Dep adds the Watcher to its subscribers (`Dep.subs`). This means the `Dep.subs` for `_route` is, at least, as large as the number of rendered RouterLinks.\r\n\r\nWhen the `$route` changes, all the RouterLink are [updated][notify] because they are on the `Dep.subs`.\r\n\r\nWhen destroying all the RouterLink (page change), all the components [teardown][teardown] their watchers, and each watcher have to remove itself from the `Dep.subs`. Removing a single RouterLink's Watcher from the `Dep.subs` costs O(N - i), where `N` is the number of RouterLink and `i` the number of RouterLink already removed.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the cost of removing N RouterLinks at once is O((N^2)/2).\r\n\r\n[watcher]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L4418\r\n[dep]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L701\r\n[notify]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L720\r\n[teardown]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L4601\r\n\r\n[route-react]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1299\r\n[route-getter]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1314\r\n[route-render]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1096\r\n\r\n[vue-virtual-scroller]: https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdding a `no-reactive` prop on RouterLink should be enough.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this prop is effectively disabling reactivity on the current route to improve the overall performance, especially when destroying many RouterLink at once.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, this flag turns off any feature that depends on the current route. At this moment, I think the only affected features are related to the CSS classes to show if a link is active or not.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

My answer to that would be it would make Vuex significantly more developer-friendly and make a significantly better developer experience. Which is the reason why Vue was created in the first place - to create a approachable/developer-friendly way to build user interfaces. A bunch of people agreed that the feature would be a good thing. Closed.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/is-it-possible-to-declare-a-watcher-inside-a-vuex-store/50375  \r\n@mikepatton75 asks if it's possible. The answer is no. Then a bunch of talk about his use-case which didn't need to happen if Vuex just had a watch option, right? Either way, there is no discussion as to WHY the feature isn't available in the Vuex API. So, that's a dead-end as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/vuex-can-i-use-watch-feature-inside-a-vuex-module/75633  \r\n@lwxbr says he does an \"extensive workaround\" to make a watcher in a store for his use-case, then opens an issue.  But, all he needed was a just simple watcher, right?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1624  \r\n@lwxbr opens the issue. Closed with reference back to #1219 that didn't have an answer.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/can-a-vuex-module-register-a-watcher-to-watch-its-local-state/8003  \r\n@jri asks if a store can watch its own state, but with an obscurely worded question about a circular file import that is pretty easy to fix with using a 3rd file. But, it never got answered, probably because the question was too obscure? But, perhaps the reason why it was obscure was probably because @jri just needed a simple watcher, but didn't have it, so it was hard to explain the problem in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nPlenty of people have already done this and have been ignored. So, that has proven to be unproductive. I'm simply asking a question \"why\" and am requesting an answer and/or productive discussion about it so that developers who have the same thought in the future have a productive place to look and understand why Vuex doesn't have a watch option.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to hear from a creator of Vuex with in-depth knowledge about Vuex/Vue as well as the philosophies behind them.\r\n\r\nPlease do not give just a random answer like, \"it's not necessary\" because, don't forget, Vue \"isn't necessary\" either. Let's all use Vanilla! \r\n\r\nI myself am a creator of a UI framework that I designed for beginner developers to learn JavaScript while also making UI frameworks easier to learn later on down the road. I've even taught Vue+Vuex to an entire development team at a company. So, I know how important the core philosophy of a library is.\r\n\r\nI have utmost respect for the developers of Vue and Vuex for making such incredible libraries, and I would hope to have that respect reciprocated with an actual productive discussion into this core feature.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Let's say I have a city name and a zip code in my state. I do not want to change the zip code if the city is not within the area of that zip code. If I do that in a mutation I have no way to reject that change or to catch an error. However if I do it in an action I still need a mutation since actions cannot modify the state directly. Now my colleague is new to our huge project and doesn't notice that one must use the action instead of the mutation and causes the state to become inconsistent. Hence I propose mutations that may only be called from an action. This would enable developers to restrict changes in state to only non-breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSince I use TypeScript the obvious way to do it seems a decorator. However to maintain consistency with the api and to be pure js compatible one might introduce a whole different category (e.g. \"setters\"). If backward compatibility were not an issue this may also become the default behavior as use-cases for mutations directly in components are rare anyhow, since most data needs validation. \r\n![Infographic from the official documentation](https://vuex.vuejs.org/vuex.png)\r\n\r\nThis infographic at  seems to imply this also. However these are just proposals off the top of my head and any implementation would need careful consideration as they would deeply impact the vuex api.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

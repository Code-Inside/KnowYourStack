Create another boolean called \"changed\". Bind a watcher to the first to detect when it changes to true, setting the \"changed\" state to true. In a function, set \"foobar\" to true and then to false. Bind this function to a button. (CodeSandbox link has all this set up.)\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe watcher should run when \"foobar\" is set to true, which would then set \"changed\" to true.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nChanged does not get set to true. The watcher is not called at all when the value is set to true.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf you remove the line that sets \"foobar\" back to false, the watcher on \"foobar\" is triggered and \"changed\" is set to true, which is weird behavior. Even weirder is that if the function is async and an await statement is placed, then things work as expected. The await can go anywhere (as shown in the CodeSandbox example).\r\n\r\nWe ran into this because we had to have a \"changed\" flag to avoid a race condition. We are using Google Maps autocomplete, which was binding to an input element, but our event listeners still needed to be on that input as well. By having the flag, we make sure to only run the proper functions once and in the correct order. We are setting the flag to true immediately and then setting it back to false after some synchronous data manipulation, but when the value is set back to false, the first switch to true is not picked up. Weird. Then somehow we tried using await this.$nextTick(), which solved it but we don't think that should be necessary.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

My current issue report says I used 3.1.3 because new-issue.vuejs.org does not let me choose 3.1.5.

Note `someProperty` will be `undefined`\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nWhen installing a dynamic module and there is no state present, a default state should be created\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen installing a dynamic module and there is no state present, the module is not registered causing reads to the state for that module to fail.\r\n\r\n---\r\nNOTE: Was unable to reproduce the issue cleanly in CodeSandbox so the reproduction is not working, but the key aspects are still there.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, it was discovered the [_vuex-module-decorators_](https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-module-decorators) lib [passes their `preserveState` flag down](https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-module-decorators/pull/102) to the vuex layer.  When the dynamic module is installed with the `installModule` function and the `hot` option is enabled, the current implementation skips creating any state for the new module.  This introduces side effects, where the module is registered in the vuex store but the state can't be retrieved if there was no state previously present.\r\n\r\nThe [_vuex-persist_](https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-persist) lib is in use, but it is used to hydrate any past state down to _vuex_.  The store, while using the _vuex-persist_ lib, has the data initialised in the following order.\r\n\r\n1. The store is created by _vuex_ and any known modules are initialised with their default values.\r\n2. If there are data in the local storage within the browser, it is loaded into the store state replacing the default state data.\r\n3. Dynamic modules are added as they are needed.\r\n\r\nUpon modifying the `installModule` function, to check if the state of the new dynamic module exists, the problem is resolved.  Essentially, if the state of the module doesn't currently exist in the `parentState` within the store, then the default module state is created and registered.\r\n\r\nOne set of changes that fix this case are as follows.\r\n\r\nIn [`src/store.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/dev/src/store.js) the following code seems to be the offending code.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// set state\r\nif (!isRoot && !hot) {\r\n  const parentState = getNestedState(rootState, path.slice(0, -1))\r\n  const moduleName = path[path.length - 1]\r\n  store._withCommit(() => {\r\n    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\r\n      if (moduleName in parentState) {\r\n        console.warn(\r\n          `[vuex] state field \"${moduleName}\" was overridden by a module with the same name at \"${path.join('.')}\"`\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    Vue.set(parentState, moduleName, module.state)\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen modified, the default state is created when the `moduleName` isn't found in the `parentState`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// set state\r\nvar parentState = getNestedState(rootState, path.slice(0, -1));\r\nvar moduleName = path[path.length - 1];\r\nvar moduleStateExists = moduleName in parentState\r\nif (!isRoot && (!hot || !moduleStateExists )) {\r\n store._withCommit(function () {\r\n   {\r\n     if (moduleStateExists) {\r\n       console.warn(\r\n         (\"[vuex] state field \\\"\"   moduleName   \"\\\" was overridden by a module with the same name at \\\"\"   (path.join('.'))   \"\\\"\")\r\n       );\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   Vue.set(parentState, moduleName, module.state);\r\n });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere may be other ways to fix this issue, this is one potential solution that was discovered after some investigation.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

My comment with tens of positive reactions and with helpful solution/workaround was deleted. Many users now can not see it. I think that it is not acceptable to do that by maintainer. Maintainer feels offended but he did not answer to my questions and to questions of other users. Here is a non-censored version from google cache https://gofile.io/d/V9pfeT (can be downloaded and viewed in chrome). My comment here https://i.ibb.co/MS85nnt/screen1.png (now deleted) another user was thanking for my comment here https://i.ibb.co/9GVS7nx/screen2.png (now deleted).\r\n\r\nI have quoted maintainer and I present proofs that he is not right. Pasting again and I will be grateful for answer.\r\n\r\n> it's because you're in composition mode (For accents, or languages like Japanese) (see the underline)\r\n\r\n**It is not truth. This bug also happens for any language (including english) when I turn on text auto prediction. It has not to do with languages like Japanese but in global with text auto prediction enabled.**\r\n\r\n> This is completely normal because until composition isn't finished, the browser doesn't inform about something being typed\r\n\r\n**It is also not truth. Browser must be informed because of this two proofs:**\r\n\r\n**1.) How it is possible that in VUE 1 v-model was working fine with text auto prediction enabled? I have tested it now.**\r\n\r\n**2.)

This environment is one namespace within a kubernetes Cluster. All services in a current develop state are deployed with the new \"snapshot\" version of the service that triggered the CICD pipeline. To have a clear route for each snapshot environment, we use the namespace as part of the URL (https://HOST/NAMESPACE/APP/paths)\r\n\r\n## Our Problem\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the URL is highly dynamic, but currently, we could just build the container with the path and be happy. Thats our current setup. Unfortunately, we want the possibility, to deploy each and every container image on every HOST as well as every NAMESPACE, those parts are only known at runtime, not in the CICD Pipeline.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to handle such a scenario with vue.js. I have basically every freedom to edit the app as well as the container, but can't change the way we want to host our app. Currently we build the App on the cluster and inject the NAMESPACE, which was the \"easiest\" way to do this. But if there is any other way, I would love to not have the build and run step together.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nNo proposed API as this is more of an question, which was asked in Forum, Discord and Stackoverflow and didn't find an answer. If its not possible to do this, a proposed API would look like the current one, with\r\n```js\r\npublicPath :\"./\"\r\n```\r\nand no change in output dir.

However,  many warnings are more severe than a warning - they break functionality. Duplicate keys are a good example. These are hard to filter out in a development environment because the production data could be different. \r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a project where parts of the API and corresponding data are over 15 years old.\r\n\r\nThis means that when a user triggers an error, we're flying blind. No errors are reported. We recently implemented Sentry (which we already ran for Laravel) but again, no errorHandler or warningHandler is triggered.\r\n\r\nWhat I would have liked was a way for us to see the error in production, but not show it to the user in their console. The error and warning handlers are perfect for this purpose, but lack this feature.\r\n\r\nAfter extensively digging through the code and making alterations I've been able to create a production build that outputs warnings and errors. Without activating development features (like devtools, perf traces etc.) - just the warnings. No loss in performance. But it took tweaking both the Vue core files and the `component-compiler-utils`.\r\n\r\nStill, it's possible, and for us, running Vue at scale, with many unknown variables - it's a must have. With these Sentries (or whatever bug tracker someone would choose) it's easy to quickly zero in on production bugs. So I'd love to improve on our solution, push it to the main repo and give back to your awesome framework :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nMy proposal is to add a new `process.env` variable called `DEBUG_LEVEL`, `WARN_LEVEL` or something along those lines. Maybe a config setting. Something simple. With it you can pick your desired verbosity. When set to FULL, it's identical to the development build. When set to HANDLER it will only trigger custom handlers (which would then be where you'd call the Sentry / error tracker). This allows for more granular control over what is triggered, and how it's shown. And then the final setting would be NONE. Which would be identical to the current production build.\r\n\r\nCurrently the `process.env.NODE_ENV` controls both the warnings _and_ the debug tools. My proposal is to separate the two. \r\n\r\nI've already done most of the leg-work. With your thumbs-up I will clean things up, write tests and push it to the dev branch.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I have not tested it, but since route A is rendered on the server and route B is rendered on the client, you might run into hydration issues. More than that, in case route A does not match any component, the SSR might unnecessarily return an error based on how you handle routes with no matched components.\r\n\r\nYou can circumvent this issue by using the `router.push` API, but I guess this is not the intended way to navigate within navigation guards?\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```js\r\nnext({\r\n  path: '/routeB',\r\n  ignoreRedirectErrors: true\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I need to replace this sidebar with `UserProfileLeftSidebar` on `/home/profile` route. However, this not possible because `leftSidebar` named view is defined in the parent view.\r\n\r\nI think that this a pretty common use case that you have a navigation bar or sidebar that needs to be replaced or modified on some router paths.\r\n\r\nI would be very glad if someone could share a solution how to implement a dynamic sidebar or navigation bar using vue-router. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe API could look like in the example above. However, it requires that every named view must have globally unique name.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

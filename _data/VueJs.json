So when `beforeLeave` is called for the second element, the first element already has `position: absolute`. This means that (while the DOM has not yet rendered the change) the position of the second element has moved to be where the first element used to be, meaning that `el.offsetLeft` is now 'incorrect'. The visual effect is that the first two elements both float to the same position. \r\n\r\nThis can be shown clearly by clicking the 'Remove First 2' button.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But instead of re-rendering just the `h1` that outputs the `message`, the entire component appears to be re-rendered, thus re-triggering all methods bound to other elements.  This occurs seemingly regardless of how the other element attributes are bound.

Currently the vnode parameter we pass to a directive includes a list of event listeners, but only exposes the reference to the event handler on an element via a private member `_wrapper`.  This is the event handler reference I will need in order to call `removeEventListener` from an element.\r\n\r\nThe use-case here is to build a reusable directive that allows gating certain features based on a condition.  Say for example you'd like to gate any component or element based on a user's permission.  You could add a `v-admin-only` directive that will disallow clicking and taking an action if the user is not an admin.  In order to accomplish that, we will need a reference to the event handler on the element in order to remove the event listener from the element.  I have found that the only location that handler is accessible is via (for a click event example) `vnode.data.on.click._wrapper` and `vnode.data.nativeOn.click._wrapper`.  The `_` implying a private member.  I'd like to be able to expose this publicly so as to be confident that this method of accessing the function would be officially supported.\r\n\r\nThe only other ways I've found for achieving a similar behavior would be to use Chrome's `getEventListeners` method, but that's only available for Chrome browser, or, overriding the native `addEventListener` method to track event listeners by element myself.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a valuable feature for Vue to support as there isn't another way to achieve this that I've found and would make directives very powerful.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n`vnode.data.on.<eventType>.wrapper`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Delete the compiled async chunks (e.g. with a command like this one:\r\n```\r\nfind ./public/assets/chunks -type f -name '[0-9]*.[0-9a-zA-Z]*.js' -delete\r\n```\r\n)\r\n\r\n3. Try to navigate to a route whose component is async\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIf a chunk fails to load or there is another navigation error, no redirect should happen, or it should be a way to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe `onError` should be used by the user to control the behaviour\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhenever a chunk fails to load, the router redirects to whatever `router.options.base` is defined to.\r\n\r\nThis redirect can't be prevented even if the `onError` catch is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nI would like to show an error screen and suggest the users to reload the page if the navigation fails.\r\n\r\nBut since the route is overwritten, reloading the page would make users end up in a totally different place from where they wanted to go.\r\n\r\nThis is an example code to give context on what I'm trying to achieve\r\n\r\n```\r\nrouter.onError((error) => {\r\n  const pattern = /Loading chunk (\\d)  failed/g;\r\n  const isChunkLoadFailed = error.message.match(pattern);\r\n  const targetPath = router.history.pending.fullPath;\r\n  if (isChunkLoadFailed) {\r\n    // Here it would be nice to show the user a button to try refreshing the page,\r\n    // But A few milliseconds after this code is executed, a redirection to \"/\" happens\r\n    // Therefore refreshing the page takes you to another page\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor anyone encountering this error, I found out you can use `history.replaceState` to go back to the current path. But I find it weird to have to do this in the first place.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Handle missing chunks\r\nrouter.onError((error) => {\r\n  const pattern = /Loading chunk (\\d)  failed/g;\r\n  const isChunkLoadFailed = error.message.match(pattern);\r\n  const targetPath = router.history.pending.fullPath;\r\n\r\n  if (isChunkLoadFailed) {\r\n    console.error(error);\r\n\r\n    modals.showError();\r\n\r\n    history.replaceState(\"\", \"\", targetPath);\r\n  } else {\r\n    throw error;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, if you are looking at data in a route/component, and that data needs to be replaced/reloaded, you are stuck in a difficult situation. Either you need to reload the entire page/app, navigate away and then back to the route, or setup overly complex logic to modify potentially deeply nested object properties in place (Which is largely unfeasible if you have to do this for hundreds of different routes...).\r\n\r\nThe solution? Simply reloading the current route as if it was being navigated to. This triggers all the route guards, triggers all the data fetching, triggers all the props assignments, and sets up the component(s) fresh as they need to be. \r\n\r\nBack in AngularJS days, this made completely refreshing a route and it's data beyond simple, as all the navigation triggers & guards have the logic to handle data getting & assignment. KISS in it's finest.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that vue router has no support for re-navigating/reloading the current route. It requires hacks or extensive workarounds, most of which directly impact user experience.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nUnsure.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of misc discussions about this, for years, all of which have been shut down.

But the watch i have for state variable 'newMEssage' is called only for third message . This is happening when we have three consecutive calls to 'setNewMessage' action. But if i have three consecutive calls to 'setNewMessage' from three different components it works fine or even from single component when there is delay\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

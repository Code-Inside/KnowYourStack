I decided to just go for it since it's a pretty small modification. Hopefully this explanation is enough, but I can always add an issue later if needed.\r\n- I'm pretty sure that I added all relevant tests and they all seem to have passed.

It might be worth considering adding the other forms as well (`NFD`,`NFKC`,`NFKD`).\r\n\r\nMore informaton on `String.normalize()` and its usefulness can be found in the following links:\r\n- [Why you need to normalize unicode strings](https://withblue.ink/2019/03/11/why-you-need-to-normalize-unicode-strings.html)\r\n- [String.normalize() ­— MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize)","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/9779","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(v-model): add normalize modifier\" (#9779)"},{"Id":"425745355","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-27T04:26:07","Actor":"longzhangtong","Number":"9780","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't `v-for` be used for Set data types?","State":"closed","Body":"### What problem does this feature solve?\r\n```\r\n\"vue\": \"^2.6.6\",\r\n```\r\nTry to use the `v-for` to traverse the Set data type, but it doesn't work.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nTraversing the Set data type using `v-for`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Immediately is optimal. But to do that, you need to assign a temporary ID until the backend responds with the actual one.\r\n\r\nCurrently, by updating an iD, you are signalling to vue that the original object has been removed, and a new one with this other ID has been added.

It seems you can use these reactive properties directly in views (you don't need to use them through local computed properties). In this scenario, it would be nice to be able to also have global state based computed properties. This way, you'd be able to create a very nice and imo quite capable yet simple store pattern (compared to more verbose and complex solutions like Vuex). You also don't have to sprinkle computed props on components where they imo don't really belong.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to do a workaround by initiating new Vue instances, but I assume that causes some significant and completely unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI'm completely open for your wisedom ;-) A few suggestions:\r\n\r\nA)\r\nVue.computed({\r\n  computedProp: function() { ... }\r\n});\r\n\r\nB)\r\nVue.observable({\r\n  regularReactiveProp: 'something',\r\n  get computedProp: function () { ... }\r\n});\r\n\r\nI'm btw. not a big fan of transforming all functions to computed props, as this makes it less simple (impossible?) to pass along one store object that also contains all methods (for a more full scale model layer).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

So, the issue is the following:\r\n\r\n**routes.js**\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    path:'/',\r\n    components:{\r\n        allPageView:LytSPA\r\n    },\r\n    meta:{\r\n        requiresAuth:true\r\n    },\r\n    children:[\r\n        {\r\n            path:'',\r\n            name:'admin',\r\n            components:{\r\n                sectionView:AdminDashboard\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            name:'admin.users',\r\n            path:'usuarios',\r\n            components:{\r\n                sectionView:Users\r\n            },\r\n            children:[\r\n                {\r\n                    name:'admin.users.create',\r\n                    path:'crear', \r\n                    components:{\r\n                        sectionView:UsersCreateEdit\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        }]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the paths are: / , /usuarios and /usuarios/crear.\r\n\r\nMy views are: App.vue (with a named view), LytSPA.vue (with a named view), AdminDashboard.vue, Users.vue, UsersCreateEdit. So, I have 2 node views and 3 leaf views.\r\n\r\n**App.vue**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n<router-view name=\"allPageView\"></router-view>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**LytSPA.vue**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n<div>\r\n    <header>\r\n        <header-view></header-view>\r\n    </header>\r\n    <transition name=\"slide-left-aside\">\r\n        <aside v-show=\"!collapsed\">\r\n            <aside-view @collapse=\"collapseAside\"></aside-view>\r\n        </aside>\r\n    </transition>\r\n    <transition name=\"slide-expand-button\">\r\n        <b-button @click=\"collapseAside(false)\" id=\"btnExpand\" v-show=\"collapsed\">\r\n            <font-awesome-icon icon=\"chevron-right\"/>\r\n        </b-button>\r\n    </transition>\r\n    <section id=\"sectionSPA\" :class=\"{collapsed: collapsed}\">\r\n        <breadcrumb-view></breadcrumb-view>\r\n        <router-view name=\"sectionView\" key=\"$route.fullPath\"></router-view>\r\n    </section>\r\n</div></template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, in **LayoutSPA.vue** I dropped my main views in the container **sectionView**, thus:\r\n\r\n - when the path is / load the Dashboard view.\r\n - when the path is /usuarios load the Users view.\r\n\r\nAnd here comes the problem, when the path is /usuarios/crear doesn´t load the UsersCreateEdit view, else it keeps the last one (Users.vue). However, the routing is working because I put a redirect validation for unknown URLs, since the url usuarios/crear doesn´t change so that's work but doesn´t load the view.\r\n\r\nI have already worked of this way with UI-Router in AngularJS and there wasn´t any problem because it works with inheritance of states, but I want to know if exists any way to do the same in Vue???\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nShow the view UserCreateEdit.vue\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nShow the view Users.vue ,this is incorrect, because it shows the same view for 2 different paths.\r\n\r\n---\r\nNote: I have an alternative solution but I don´t like it, because I have to put the admin.users.create route as a sibling of admin.users and it works but I need that it be nested because I need to retrieve the matched routes to build my breadcrumb and I don't want to parse the path to build it.\r\n\r\nImage of running application: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ZC1c.png\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

If I create a function and attach it to a click event (e.g. on a Button) such as shown below, I have no issues.

So when `beforeLeave` is called for the second element, the first element already has `position: absolute`. This means that (while the DOM has not yet rendered the change) the position of the second element has moved to be where the first element used to be, meaning that `el.offsetLeft` is now 'incorrect'. The visual effect is that the first two elements both float to the same position. \r\n\r\nThis can be shown clearly by clicking the 'Remove First 2' button.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Currently the vnode parameter we pass to a directive includes a list of event listeners, but only exposes the reference to the event handler on an element via a private member `_wrapper`.  This is the event handler reference I will need in order to call `removeEventListener` from an element.\r\n\r\nThe use-case here is to build a reusable directive that allows gating certain features based on a condition.  Say for example you'd like to gate any component or element based on a user's permission.  You could add a `v-admin-only` directive that will disallow clicking and taking an action if the user is not an admin.  In order to accomplish that, we will need a reference to the event handler on the element in order to remove the event listener from the element.  I have found that the only location that handler is accessible is via (for a click event example) `vnode.data.on.click._wrapper` and `vnode.data.nativeOn.click._wrapper`.  The `_` implying a private member.  I'd like to be able to expose this publicly so as to be confident that this method of accessing the function would be officially supported.\r\n\r\nThe only other ways I've found for achieving a similar behavior would be to use Chrome's `getEventListeners` method, but that's only available for Chrome browser, or, overriding the native `addEventListener` method to track event listeners by element myself.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a valuable feature for Vue to support as there isn't another way to achieve this that I've found and would make directives very powerful.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n`vnode.data.on.<eventType>.wrapper`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

You can view the two components in the `/components` folder in order to see the differences. The only difference (aside from naming) in the two components is that one adds a watch onto the computed property.\r\n\r\nThe basic concept here is:\r\n1. Have an empty data option\r\n2. Add some data nodes in the `created` option\r\n3. Have a `computed` property which derives from the values of these nodes\r\n4. Echo or make use of the computed property in the created method after the nodes are created.\r\n5. Add a watch on the computed property (causes the error).\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nAdding a watch shouldn't significantly change the life-cycle of when computed properties are calculated. So adding the watch shouldn't cause the computed property to fail. \r\n\r\nI thought that was the point of the `immediate` flag on a watch, which is to say that the watch will not by default trigger before the component is created unless that flag is set.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt seems that before the watch is added, the computed property is only calculated within the `created` method. However once the watch is added, the computed property attempts to calculate its value before the value exists, regardless of whether the `immediate` flag on the watch is set or not.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt may be that when a computed property is calculated is determined not by the lifecycle but rather by when that value is first used, in which case this is not essentially a bug but rather an edge-case. However I would submit that this is problematic for the Vue ecosystem and reputation because by adding a watch you can inadvertently fundamentally change the operating sequence of your component, which breaks things and makes it very hard to refactor or design resilient components.\r\n\r\nThere should be some way to control this so that you can create a watch on a computed property but have the same flexibility extended in the sense of being able to hydrate that computed property in a lifecycle hook before the watch kicks in. \r\n\r\nThe way I ran into this bug is as follows. I started out with a component that needs a watch function on a computed property in order to add dynamic rows to a variety of other affected components. This was working fine while the `empty row` state was static. However, at a certain point I decided that those empty states needed to be fetched remotely, which meant that the data nodes used within the computed properties wouldn't exist immediately. Instead they would be added by the `created` hook. Once I did that my code immediately broke because the watch tries to access the computed properties before they are viable.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, if you are looking at data in a route/component, and that data needs to be replaced/reloaded, you are stuck in a difficult situation. Either you need to reload the entire page/app, navigate away and then back to the route, or setup overly complex logic to modify potentially deeply nested object properties in place (Which is largely unfeasible if you have to do this for hundreds of different routes...).\r\n\r\nThe solution? Simply reloading the current route as if it was being navigated to. This triggers all the route guards, triggers all the data fetching, triggers all the props assignments, and sets up the component(s) fresh as they need to be. \r\n\r\nBack in AngularJS days, this made completely refreshing a route and it's data beyond simple, as all the navigation triggers & guards have the logic to handle data getting & assignment. KISS in it's finest.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that vue router has no support for re-navigating/reloading the current route. It requires hacks or extensive workarounds, most of which directly impact user experience.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nUnsure.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of misc discussions about this, for years, all of which have been shut down.

But the watch i have for state variable 'newMEssage' is called only for third message . This is happening when we have three consecutive calls to 'setNewMessage' action. But if i have three consecutive calls to 'setNewMessage' from three different components it works fine or even from single component when there is delay\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Right now the use of [generic parameter defaults](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-3.html#generic-parameter-defaults) in helper.d.ts only requires Typescript 2.3._\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the typings of `Store`. Right now, given code like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet moduleC = {\r\n    state() {\r\n        return {\r\n            valueC: -13\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet moduleA = {\r\n    state() {\r\n        return ({\r\n            valueA: \"6\",\r\n        })\r\n    },\r\n    modules: {\r\n        c: moduleC,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet moduleB = {\r\n    state: {\r\n        a: 36,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n    state: () => ({\r\n        foo: 6\r\n    }),\r\n    modules: {\r\n        a: moduleA,\r\n        b: moduleB,\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould result in the type of `store.state` to only consider the local state in the root. Also `store.state` would be typed as a function and not as its return type. With this PR the type of `store.state` will correspond to\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    foo: number;\r\n    a: {\r\n        valueA: string;\r\n        c: {\r\n            valueC: number;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    b: {\r\n        a: number;\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nWe provided defaults for new generics, therefore one should be able to still use the types as before.\r\n\r\n### About older TS versions\r\nThere seems to be a strange bug in older versions of Typescript. Sometimes the type of a store differs depending on wheather you use the `{ state() { return {...}}, ... }` or the `{ state: () => ({...}), ... }` syntax. Its not that much of a problem though. We tested the typings in 2.8.4 and the only thing that happens was that the properties are missing, but TS does not throw an error (as long as you don't try to access one of these properties) In newer versions of Typescript everything is fine.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1797","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support modules and state functions in Store typings\" (#1797)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-09-10T05:30:43.8971994Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1793}

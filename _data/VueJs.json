Vue.nextTick doesn't seem to cover it, and setTimeout(..., 0) is not good enough.","State":"closed","Body":"### What problem does this feature solve?\r\n\r\nExample in a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/szal/eywraw8t/500316/ - when I click Load, I never see the \"Loading...\" indicator. \r\n\r\nWhen I have a Vue component in a .vue file with a data member isLoading: false, and a template:\r\n\r\n    <div v-show=\"isLoading\" id=\"hey\" ref=\"hey\">Loading...</div>\r\n    <button @click=\"loadIt()\">Load it</button>\r\n\r\nAnd a method:\r\n\r\n     loadIt() {\r\n       this.isLoading = true\r\n       this.$nextTick(() => {\r\n          console.log(this.$refs.hey)\r\n          // ...other synchronous work here that causes other DOM changes\r\n        this.isLoading = false\r\n       })\r\n     }\r\n\r\n(\"Loading\" here refers to loading from the in-memory store, not an AJAX request. I want to do this so that I can show a simple \"loading\" indicator instantly while the DOM changes that might take 0.2-0.5 second or so are occurring.)\r\n\r\nI thought that the $nextTick function would allow both the virtual and actual DOM to update. The console log reads that the item was \"shown\" (removing the display: none style). However, in both Chrome and Firefox, I never see the \"Loading...\" indicator; the short delay happens, and the other DOM changes happen without the Loading indicator being shown.\r\n\r\nIf I use setTimeout instead of $nextTick, I will see the loading indicator, but only when the other work is sufficiently slow. If there is a delay of a few tenths of a second, the loading indicator never shows. I'd like it to appear immediately on click so that I can present a snappy GUI.\r\n\r\nMy unsatisfying solution: I have to wrap the work in a setTimeout(..., 25), per seebiscuit's findings here: https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1023#issuecomment-358456384\r\n\r\nThis seems to reveal that the documentation on Vue.nextTick at https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Vue-nextTick is inaccurate: \"Defer the callback to be executed after the next DOM update cycle. Use it immediately after you’ve changed some data to wait for the DOM update.\"  This seems wrong; this is a good case where the user doesn't see the DOM update at all even though Vue.nextTick was used.\r\n\r\n Calling setTimeout(..., 25) doesn't seem very discoverable or intuitive for anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI'd propose either a change to Vue.nextTick to work better, or a parallel call just like Vue.nextTick, perhaps \"nextRender\" (maybe there's a better name?) that ensures that any DOM changes can get displayed to the user before its callback is invoked asynchronously.  So then I could do something like:\r\n\r\n    methods: {\r\n     async selectThing() {\r\n      this.thingIsLoading = true  // this triggers a dead-simple v-show\r\n      await this.$nextRender() // the new Vue API call; give browser a chance to paint the loading indicator\r\n      const route = setQuery(this.$route, 'thingid', this.thingViewModel.thing.id)\r\n      this.$router.push(route) // this triggers lots of reactivity that may take a big fraction of a second to rerender/paint\r\n      this.thingIsLoading = false\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf others feel that instead an enhancement to the behavior of Vue.nextTick is in order, I'd prefer that.\r\n\r\nI'd also propose changing the documentation at https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Vue-nextTick to be more accurate and perhaps explain this limitation and a workaround to future developers.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

So it also works with deconstructing:\r\n\r\n``` vue\r\n<comp v-scope=\"{ msg }\">\r\n  {{ msg }}\r\n</comp>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why a New Directive\r\n\r\nI believe the team briefly discussed what I proposed in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7740#issuecomment-371309357 on Slack some time back, but I could no longer find the chat record. Here's the reasoning behind a new directive:\r\n\r\n- `slot-scope` was introduced as a special attribute instead of a directive (attributes that start with `v-` prefix) because `slot` is an attribute, and we wanted to keep slot-related attributes consistent. `slot` was in turn introduced as a non-directive attribute because we want the usage to mirror the actual slot usage in the Shadow DOM standard. We figured it would be best to avoid having our own parallel `v-slot` when there's something that is conceptually the same in the standard.\r\n\r\n- Originally, `slot-scope` was designed to be only usable on `<template>` elements that act as abstract containers. But that was verbose - so we introduced the ability to use it directly on a slot element without the wrapping `<template>`. However, this also makes it impossible to allow using `slot-scope` directly on the component itself, because it would lead to ambiguity as illustrated [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7740#issuecomment-370252860).\r\n\r\n- I thought about adding modifiers or special prefixes to `slot-scope` so that that we can use it on a component directly to indicate its slot content should be treated as the default scoped slot, but neither a modifier or a prefix like `$` seem to be the right fit. The modifier by design should only be applied to directives, while new special syntax for a single use case is inconsistent with the whole syntax design.\r\n\r\n- For a very long time we've shied away from adding more directives, part of it being template syntax is something we want to keep as stable as possible, part of it being that we want to keep core directives to a minimum and only do things that users cannot easily do in userland. However, in this case scoped slot usage is important enough, and I think a new directive can be justified for making its usage significantly less noisy.\r\n\r\n### Concerns\r\n\r\n- The expression accepted by `v-scope` is different from most other directives: it expects a temporary variable name (which can also be a deconstruction), but not without a precedence: it acts just like the alias part of `v-for`. So conceptually `v-scope` falls into the same camp with `v-for` as a structural directive that creates temporary variables for its inner scope.\r\n\r\n- This would break the users code if the user has a custom directive named `v-scope` and is used on a component.\r\n\r\n  - Since custom directives in v2 are primarily focused on direct DOM manipulations, it's relatively rare to see custom directives used on components, even more so for something that happens to be called `v-scope`, so the impact should be minimal.\r\n\r\n  - Even in the case of it actually happening, it is straightforward to deal with by simply renaming the custom directive.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RFC: Simplify scoped slot usage\" (#9180)"},{"Id":"389397144","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-10T17:30:33","Actor":"minaseem","Number":"9179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Autocomplete email field's model is not populated properly when there are multiple forms in a single page","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.5.2\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codesandbox.io/s/5xlrk8v80k](https://codesandbox.io/s/5xlrk8v80k)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nGo to https://codesandbox.io/s/5xlrk8v80k\r\n1.

On the other hand it is not possible to hook into a plugins destroy/replacement.\r\nIn production mode there is no need for such hook, because it's not possible to remove a plugin (this might be reconsidered after https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/467#issuecomment-266493888).\r\n\r\nBut given the [plugin example](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/plugins.html#committing-mutations-inside-plugins) which registers event handlers on the `socket` and taking [hot reloading](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/hot-reload.html) into account, the handlers are registered multiple times.\r\nThere is no way to unregister an event handler before the plugin gets replaced.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a general problem with a HMR system (like webpack's) or if its caused by the [`store.hotUpdate()`](https://vuex.vuejs.org/api/#hotupdate) function. I suspect, that even `store.subscribe()` gets called multiple times causing the code to be executed multiple times after some hot replacements.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**:\r\nStore event handlers in a local variable outside the plugin's context.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nEither additional methods exposed by the plugin (similar to [this](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/467#issuecomment-270836284)):\r\n```\r\nconst myPlugin = {\r\n  init(store) {\r\n     registerAllEventListeners()\r\n\r\n     store.subscribe((mutation, state) => {\r\n        doSomething()\r\n     })\r\n  },\r\n  beforeDestroy(store) {\r\n     unregisterAllEventListeners()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr as a store instance method:\r\n```\r\nconst myPlugin = (store) => {\r\n   registerAllEventListeners()\r\n\r\n   store.subscribe((mutation, state) => {\r\n       doSomething()\r\n   })\r\n\r\n  store.subscribeBeforeDestroy(() => {\r\n     unregisterAllEventListeners()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter wouldn't introduce breaking changes of the plugin API.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Consider the fact that some component can be delayed rendered by `v-if=state` (so components may be mounted/unmounted during time-traveling), the same may also happen if the one uses `@vue/vuex-router-sync`, this feature is good to have.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWhen we click \"time travel to the state\" in the dev tool, Vuex internally have a mechanism to silent and ignore any dispatch or commit to be performed (or prevent state to be mutated during time-traveling).  This locking mechanism can be unlocked if we decide to either **revert** or **traverse** to the latest state (they are basically the same).  While I have little clue how we are going to implement this or should we have this, after discussed with my colleagues, I think it would be beneficial to open this discussion.\r\n\r\n** the reason I post this here is due to the fact that the devTool have to touch the vuex core if we want to have this.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Overuse string when using `mapState`, `mapGetters`, `mapActions`\r\n2. Duplicated namespace in components\r\n\r\nlike this:\r\n_my-component.vue_ (AS-IS version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...mapState(\"todos\", {\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...mapGetters(\"todos\", {\r\n      doneItems: \"doneItems\",\r\n      activeItems: \"activeItems\",\r\n    }),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, `\"doneItmes\"` is written by string. It will cause bug easily.\r\nAnd there are duplicated namespace called `\"todos\"`. It will inhibit maintainabillity.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe way to introduce it is not to suggest a new API, but to use the existing API properly.\r\nWe can use `createNamespacedHelpers` API with constants in store directory!\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/types.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const NAMESPACE = \"todos\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/index.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createNamespacedHelpers } from\"vuex\";\r\nimport { NAMESPACE } from \"./types\";\r\n\r\n// Key point !\r\nconst { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions } = createNamespacedHelpers(NAMESPACE);\r\n\r\nexport { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions };\r\n\r\nexport default { /* namespaced, state, getters, mutations, actions */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/getters.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Key point !\r\nexport const DONE_ITEMS = \"DONE_ITEMS\";\r\nexport const ACTIVE_ITEMS = \"ACTIVE_ITEMS\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  [DONE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => todo.isDone),\r\n  [ACTIVE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => !todo.isDone)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we can use customized binding helpers.\r\n\r\n_my-component.vue_ (TO-BE version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as todos from '@/store/todos'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as getters from '@/store/todos/getters'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as actions from '@/store/todos/types'; // Key point !\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...todos.mapState({\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...todos.mapGetters([\r\n      getters.DONE_ITEMS,\r\n      getters.ACTIVE_ITEMS,\r\n    ])\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...todos.mapActions([\r\n      actions.ADD_ITEM,\r\n    ]),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow about this? If you do not mind this, I would like to post it on the official Vuex document.\r\nYou can see the all example code in [this repository](https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/vuex-best-practice-lab)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

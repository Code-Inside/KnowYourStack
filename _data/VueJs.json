We abstracted it in a way that would enable us to keep the complicated functionality in reusable components, while the style of the UI and the contents of cards could be customized from a higher level view component. We were able to support the data and functionality of this pretty easily with slots and slotProps. But when it came time to style things, it got a lot harder. \r\n\r\nAnother use case I've run into in the past was redesigning an existing app that had global CSS files set in `main.js`. I wanted to be able to work on my new pages and components in the same codebase, without having to worry about inheritance issues with the old styles and without breaking every other page. So I tried to figure out how I could take the CSS files out of main, and include them on the highest level component of the old app, so I could create a new high level component with different CSS files, or just scoped styles in each component. I was pretty new to Vue at the time, but I couldn't find a way to do this. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nFor both of my use cases, a `deep` attribute on the style tag in single-file components would have addressed this. It could behave exactly like the `:deep` and `:slotted` selectors work in CSS, except this would enable both style blocks and external stylesheets to have their scope defined and it would be a cleaner way to set these styles because there would be less issues with CSS preprocessors struggling with custom selectors.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped></style>\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" deep></style>\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" slotted></style>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, I am unable to find mutations nor actions.\r\n\r\nI first tried to set namespace to false, the mutations and actions were not registered as global mutations and actions. (There are no such mutations or actions at all)\r\n\r\nI then tried to set namespace to true, the mutations and actions were not registered as namespaced mutations and actions neither. (```this.$store.commit('moduleName/mutationName')``` doesn't work; an error message pops up: ```[vuex] unknown action type: categories/getAllCategories```)\r\n\r\nI tried to debug by printing out the 'categories' module object and the store object and I found that:\r\n\r\n 1. Modules themselves are correctly defined. Mutations and Actions are correctly defined in the module object.\r\n 2. Module states are correctly registered in store.state (as per previously tested)\r\n 3. Module mutations and actions are not correctly registered in ```store._mutations``` and ```store._actions``` (no matter the modules are namespaced or not, the mutations and actions don't appear as global or namespaced properties); ```store._mutations``` and ```store._actions``` show as empty objects. \r\n 4. Modules can be seen in ```store._modules.root._children``` and ```store._modules.root._rawModule```\r\n\r\nThe result of console.log(categories) and console.log(this.$store) are shown: \r\n[![console.log(categories)][1]][1]\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n[![console.log(this.$store)][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone help me to solve the issue?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Steps to reproduce\r\n- In a nodejs app open app.js with VSCode and type \"import create\"\r\n- Select \"createStore / node_modules/vuex/types/index\" and press enter\r\n- Results in \"import { createStore } from 'node_modules/vuex/types/index';\"\r\n- Execute \"npm run watch\"\r\n- Fails with \"Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'node_modules/vuex/types/index' in '/var/www/vhosts/yourwebsite/httpdocs/resources/js'\"\r\n- Change \"import { createStore } from 'node_modules/vuex/types/index';\" to \"import { createStore } from 'vuex';\"\r\n- \"npm run watch\" now works BUT autocompletion for the \"store\" is no longer available\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n\"npm run watch\" should work simultaneous with autocompletion\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n\"npm run watch\" works or autocompletion works, not both\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

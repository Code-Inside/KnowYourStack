It makes migration from `2.x` to `3.x` one step easier.\r\n\r\n> If you were previously using @vue/composition-api, update imports from it to vue instead.

This is a breaking change when compared to 2.6 because here the `exports` field is not used and hence you always get the commonjs version. This can be problematic for example when using @vue/test-utils or vue-template-compiler because those use require to import vue (which led me to open this issue).\r\n\r\nAs per the [dual package hazard](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#dual-package-hazard), I think it would be better to use an esm wrapper, where `vue.runtime.mjs` does something like\r\n```js\r\nimport Vue from './vue.runtime.common.js';\r\nexport default Vue;\r\nexport const { watch, computed, h, ... } = Vue;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

All that's happening here is the state is being set to a value. According to Pinia's docs, this should work just fine. And indeed it does _in the browser._\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport serialize from 'serialize-javascript'\r\n\r\nexport const useSiteStore = defineStore('site', {\r\n  state: () => ({\r\n    domain: null\r\n  }),\r\n  actions: {\r\n    async setSite(domain) {\r\n      console.log(serialize(this.domain)) // { \"value\": null }\r\n      this.domain = domain\r\n      console.log(serialize(this.domain)) // \"example.com\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe console.log outputs should match _in structure_ with just the value having changed. I'm unsure whether it should be an object returned or strictly just the value, but it should be the same for both. (The browsers return `null` and then `\"example.com\"`). `this.domain` should be updated reactively.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen `this.domain = domain` is executed, the reactive reference or whatever you'd call it is _overwritten and replaced_ by a plain JS string. The result is that `this.domain` is no longer reactive. It's worth noting that the above code works perfectly in Chrome/Firefox. It only fails during SSR. As a result Node.js is outputting `[Vue warn]: toRefs() expects a reactive object but received a plain one.`\r\n\r\n---\r\nI initially filed this issue with the Pinia team, but they don't seem convinced that this is a Pinia issue. https://github.com/vuejs/pinia/discussions/1425\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Open Codesandbox\r\n2. Click on \"Click me\"\r\n3. The browser opens `example.org`\r\n\r\nLocally:\r\n1. Create a blank Vue app with vue-router\r\n2. Add a link as follow: <router-link :to=\"url\">Click me</router-link>\r\n3. Specify a url with a line break such as :\r\n```js\r\n/\r\n/example.com\r\n```\r\n4. Click the link, your browser will open `/example.com`\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIt should trigger an error. Whether not a valid URL or not the same origin or redirect to `/`.\r\nOr it should redirects to `//example.com` (removing line breaks)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe browser opens `http://example.com`\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe bug was reported to us by a bug hunter. \r\n\r\nOne of our URL `https://dashboard.mailmeteor.com/login?redirect=%2F` was affected by the bug. If you share a URL to Mailmeteor having a line break in it, such as `https://dashboard.mailmeteor.com/login?redirect=%2F%0D%0A%2Fexample.com`, our application was redirecting to the distant domain. This has been fixed on our application by preventing redirection to URLs with multiple lines.\r\n\r\nWhile looking at the source of this issue, turns out that vue-router codebase defaults to `window.location.replace` in case the `history.replaceState` methods triggers an error. See here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/677f3c1f714fb61cc495345e535409b1cbb90429/src/util/push-state.js#L40\r\n\r\nAnd `window.location.replace(url)` has a \"bug\" that when you provide a url with a line break, it redirects to the last line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar url = `/\r\n/example.org`\r\nwindow.location.replace(url) // opens \"example.org\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

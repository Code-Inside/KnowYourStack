Sometimes how an element looks and is styled really depends to the component it belongs to.\r\nPardon me if there's something I overlooked and that isn't an actual issue. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWhat catches my attention about scoped styling is it goes down to the following structure:\r\n`<div data-v-783f90ce=\"\"><header data-v-783f90ce=\"\">` so the styling goes like:\r\n```css\r\ndiv header[data-v-783f90ce] {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen I believe in regular css is perfectly fine to use inheritance like:\r\n```css\r\ndiv[data-v-783f90ce] header {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAlthough I believe that the problem I witnessed has somewhat in common with the `data-v-` attribute but not quite sure is it the real reason for the current implementation behavior.\r\nNevertheless I think **vuejs** is great framework  and I just love it and especially the ease and convenience it creates and how good and logical it structured and interacts naturally. So I believe that the following precedent creates inconvenience and is in conflict with framework great nature.\r\nI sure believe that what occurs isn't accidental so there's a particular reason for current implementation perhaps this is how upcoming native css specification looks like so you have to follow it or some other particular reason but still there might be a solution.\r\n\r\nProbably `scoped=\"deep\"`  where deep selecting works as default  or `scoped=\"inherit\"` where `data-v` inheritance concerns parent and it takes care for its children styling might be a good tip so please consider it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time keep up the good work. Appreciate it, great framework.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Whether the users can use a slot doesn't rely on if they want data from slot scope, but on whether the slot is gonna be rendered for multiple times inside the component self, this may raise more confusion for our users (like #8175).\r\n\r\nSo why don't we just get rid of such caveats and let a slot to be rendered more than once? We can clone them on duplication to prevent render errors as we already run the scoped slot function each time anyway. This makes the logic a lot simpler for users IMO: if we do not expect to use data from the slot scope, just use a slot, otherwise we'll always have to declare `slot-scope` to create the binding.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this would make documenting the (scoped) slots of a component more consistently, we just declare the data structure for a slot scope and users can decide if they want some data to bind to the `slot-scope` and don't need to care about how many times it will be rendered.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nNo additional API needed, just clone the slot nodes upon render and remove the waring about duplicated slots.\r\n\r\nIt may be implemented in userland today in a quite hacky way, see: https://codesandbox.io/s/lp11y2wovz\r\n\r\nI just tweaked the `cloneVNode` function from the Vue core a little bit and it seemed to be working as expected using render function (without losing reactivity and event binding). There maybe some other edge situations I missed so correct me if it's not such trivial.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But mutation is for change the state, if I use it like this, I will be doing something too strange that I don't want really want to do.\r\n\r\nI hope really Vuex getters can have a payload.\r\n\r\nLast question, I think there maybe also a design problem with the name getter. In fact, if a getter return directlly the state, then we can change the state use this getter. It's strange because it's just a getter not getter&&setter.\r\n\r\nI hope really someone can fix the two problems, for a long time I think I can work with these problems exist.....it's not true now......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n1. getter can have a payload\r\n2. getter cant change directly the state\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Oddly enough, there are some circumstances where it renders properly. In my use-case, I had no issues with the multiple root elements when I put the component inside a `<table>`, but when I wrapped the component with a `<tbody>` I ran into this issue I'm reporting.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Our css and js bundles tend to increase in size and we are always trying to reduce them.\r\n\r\nWe are now looking into some options for isomorphic templates in js and I think it's curious most of the other ones have a way to hydrate from the client js code.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for here is to send less code to client and only necessary code. Apart from bundle size I'm also considering https://medium.com/dev-channel/the-cost-of-javascript-84009f51e99e\r\n\r\nIf I use vuejs as framework to write all my templates in server side (code consistency, less time teaching developers multiple technologies and other benefits) I will end up with:\r\n- some static pages (such as documentation or FAQ) \r\n- some very dynamic pages (search, e-commerce catalogs)\r\n- some hybrid pages (might be such as a static page with a options for signup and search with some validation and/or autocomplete inside)\r\n\r\nWhen I try to create js bundles to send to the customer I'm trying to keep only the necessary js code with tree shaking and import of modules based on components used.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understood from https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/hydration.html the attribute that will tell vuejs that this application needs to be hydrated is created in the ssr version and is only available in the wrapper element of the application. This means that the only way to do hydration is to send the whole page app (SPA isn't something possible in the following years). If I want to force hydration of specific components I'll have to manually add this attribute to each one myself (a hack that would increase risk of bad implementations).\r\n\r\nI like the way [Reactjs has a .hydrate method](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate) or how Svelte [has a hydration flag](https://svelte.technology/guide#hydration). This way I can just ship a small component as part of the js bundle and initialize in the way I want.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAs it seems the clientside vuejs doesn't use any extra configuration and only read the attribute right now, I guess this could be done with a flag when creating the Vue instance.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar app = new Vue({\r\n  hydrate: true,\r\n  el: '#my-specific-component',\r\n  data: {\r\n    message: 'Hydrated!'\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nor maybe this can be done in vue config (at least for my case).\r\n\r\n```\r\nVue.config.hydrate = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Signals are usually carried as events and reacted to via `vm.$on()` resp. `vm.$once()`.\r\nNow that we have `async/await`, we could improve developer ergonomy greatly by having a Promise returned from `vm.$once()` – similar to `vm.$nextTick()`.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n> **Note:** I've omitted any additional boilerplate from the examples below. Please assume each example is executed in the context of an `async` Vue method.\r\n\r\nSo what we'd want to do is deferring the execution of our code until the `signal` event is emitted by our Vue instance.\r\n\r\nA quick recap how this could currently be done:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Old School: Use a callback\r\nthis.$once('signal', (...payload) => {\r\n  // Could lead to some callback hell though\r\n})\r\n\r\n// Alternatively: Wrap in a Promise\r\nconst payload = await new Promise(resolve =>\r\n  this.$once('signal', (...payload) => resolve(payload))\r\n)\r\n// However, this is an awful lot of boilerplate, and it gets incredibly messy if we'd want to await various different signals\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow this would look with the proposed change:\r\n```javascript\r\n// The following $once() call got no callback parameter, so it returns a Promise (which resolves to an array of the event parameters)\r\nconst payload = await this.$once('signal')\r\n\r\n// This is effectively equivalent to the Promise wrap example from above\r\n\r\n// Bonus: Multiple different signals\r\nconst payloads = await Promise.all([\r\n  this.$once('signal-1'),\r\n  this.$once('signal-2'),\r\n  this.$once('signal-3')\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that a Promise would only be returned if the callback parameter was omitted, so the following still works:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Inside some method\r\nthis\r\n  .$once('signal', (...payload) => {\r\n    // This $once() call still returns the Vue instance, no change to current behaviour\r\n  })\r\n  .$on('other-event', () => {\r\n    // That means we can still chain event listeners and avoid a practical breaking change\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is technically a breaking change, it's a rather soft one since previously using the `$once()` method without a callback had no use case.\r\n\r\nTo me, this change sounds like pretty low-hanging fruit.

But as a nature of web app, user may directly visit any \"deep route\" via a \"deep url\" and the \"back\" button loses its power to navigate through the reverse path:\r\n\r\n1. User visits `https://app.example.com/settings/general/about`\r\n2. User clicks back\r\n3. App exits \r\n*Instead, we want the app to navigate to `/settings/general`*\r\n\r\nI have managed to automatically inject the `/settings`, `/settings/general` routes when user directly visits `/settings/general/about`. The problem is these two pages and transitions associated to them show up in this process. \r\n\r\nI need the routing life cycles of auto injected routes, i.e. `/settings`, `/settings/general`,  to be complete to make the later `back` operation possible, but a complete routing life cycle causes the corresponding component to be rendered thus the problem occurred.\r\n\r\nIf I can mute/turn off the `<router-view>`'s rendering before the automatic injection starts and then turn it on later when the injection ends the problem would be hopefully solved.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nrouter.mute()\r\nrouter.unmute()\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Great! However, when an anchor tag is appended to trigger an app behavior (e.g. www.my-vue-spa.com/playlist-1234#fullview), the router pushes this as part of the history so that the back-button undoes the anchor state instead of returning to the previous page.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe proposed solution would be to enforce what the current documentation currently suggests: to not let anchor tags drive routing history. The descriptions for 'hash' mode is \"uses the URL hash for routing\" and since history mode is not hash mode, the anchor tag would not affect $router.hash.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The only action in our entire application that does not have such effects is our scroll to effect.  As it is the only transition-free state change, it often is jarring to users when it occurs.  Adding a simple scroll effect to the scroll behavior would go a long way to making the user experience for many Vue applications more seamless.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nHonestly I have no idea what this would look like as I have only just begun looking into your docs today.

But right now it can (accidentally) be circumvented with closures, by adding a function to the state.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Create a closure\r\nconst myFunctionFactory = () => {\r\n\tconst myValues = {\r\n\t\tfoo: 0,\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\treturn () => {\r\n\t\tmyValues.foo  = 1;\r\n\t\treturn myValues.foo;\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Get the function inside the closure\r\nconst myFunction = myFunctionFactory();\r\n\r\n// Add the function to the state\r\nVue.set( state, 'myFunction', myFunction );\r\n\r\n// New each time the function is called, a different result is returned\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 1;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 2;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 3;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 4;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can introduce really subtle bugs and also makes time travel unusable. There also seems to be no way to prevent this, except for not allowing functions in state at all.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to hear other peoples opinions on the subject.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIn my opinion adding functions to the state should be discouraged in docs.\r\n\r\nIn dev mode it would be great if an error could be thrown if a function is discovered in the state - at least if strict mode is enabled or something like that.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

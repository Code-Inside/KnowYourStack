We need to use Composition API in our project as preparation for Vue 3 + Nuxt 3 migration\r\n2. Nuxt Bridge is not stable enough, so we use Nuxt Composition API\r\n3. Internally, Nuxt Composition API uses Vue's native instance realization\r\n4. Nuxt Composition API doesn't have helper functions for context fixing, unlike Nuxt 3/Nuxt Bridge (can't use yet)\r\n5. We lose instance after calling one await without able to restore\r\n6. All Nuxt helpers become unavailable with \"This must be called within a setup function\" error\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { defineComponent, onMounted, ref, getCurrentInstance, setCurrentInstance } from 'vue';\r\n//...\r\n        const instance = getCurrentInstance();\r\n        onMounted(async () => {\r\n            await someAsync();\r\n            setCurrentInstance(instance?.proxy); //not exported right now\r\n            store.action(); //Uses Nuxt Helpers, which are unavailable without instance\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nsetCurrentInstance is exported just like getCurrentInstance does\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

link\r\n[github.com](https://github.com/YataoZhang/vueSSRwithWebpack5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nstep 1: write a simple vue-router use cases：\r\n```javascript\r\nimport Vue from 'vue';\r\nimport VueRouter from \"vue-router\";\r\n\r\nVue.use(VueRouter);\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    const router = new VueRouter({\r\n        mode: 'history',\r\n        base: '/',\r\n        routes: [\r\n            {\r\n                path: '/',\r\n                redirect: '/index'\r\n            }, {\r\n                path: '/index',\r\n                component: () => import(\r\n                    /* webpackChunkName: \"index\" */\r\n                    '@/pages/index.vue'\r\n                )\r\n            }, {\r\n                path: '/about',\r\n                component: () => import(\r\n                    /* webpackChunkName: \"about\" */\r\n                    '@/pages/about.vue'\r\n                )\r\n            }],\r\n    });\r\n    return router;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 2: configuration vue.config.js for server bundle of SSR Mode:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { defineConfig } = require('@vue/cli-service')\r\nconst nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals');\r\nconst VueSSRServerPlugin = require('vue-server-renderer/server-plugin');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = defineConfig({\r\n  productionSourceMap: false,\r\n  css: {\r\n    extract: false,\r\n  },\r\n  transpileDependencies: true,\r\n  configureWebpack: {\r\n    entry: '@/enter-server.js',\r\n    target: 'node',\r\n    output: {\r\n      library: {\r\n        type: 'commonjs2'\r\n      },\r\n      libraryTarget: 'commonjs2',\r\n    },\r\n    externals: nodeExternals({\r\n      allowlist: [/\\.css$/],\r\n    }),\r\n    optimization: {\r\n      splitChunks: { chunks: 'all' },\r\n    },\r\n    plugins: [\r\n      new VueSSRServerPlugin(),\r\n    ],\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 3: write a render test case:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { createBundleRenderer } = require('vue-server-renderer');\r\nconst serverBundle = require('./dist/vue-ssr-server-bundle.json');\r\nconst createRenderer = (bundle, options = {}) => {\r\n    return createBundleRenderer(bundle, Object.assign(options, {\r\n        runInNewContext: false\r\n    }));\r\n};\r\nlet renderer = createRenderer(serverBundle);\r\nconst ctx = {\r\n    route: { path: '/index' },\r\n};\r\nrenderer.renderToString(ctx, (err, html) => {\r\n    if (err) {\r\n        return console.log(err);\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(html);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nrun command: `npm run build`, and it will emit some errors:\r\n```\r\n[vue-router] Failed to resolve async component default: Error: Cannot find module '../js/index.5c9c2de1.js'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIn Webpack5, when the output.target is \"node\". it will use the `installChunk(require(\"../\" + __webpack_require__.u(chunkId)));` to load the all async modules. and \"`vue-server-renderer/server-plugin`\" will put all modules in .json file.\r\n\r\nThe reason it on the \"../\". while `renderToString()` was executed. \r\ncause cannot resolve and async components bundle with prefix ”.../“ in `evaluateModule()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nfinally, i am apologize for my pool english.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When removing hundreds or thousands of links from the page, this cost is noticeable, especially on slow devices. The goal is a cost of O(N).\r\n\r\nHundreds or thousands of links might seem too much, but sure there might be some cases where it makes sense, like an infinite scroll or some big grids. In many cases [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller) should solve the general problem, but I think it would be better not to require it as a rule.\r\n\r\nRemoving the dependency on $route means effectively disabling reactivity for the RouterLink and thus all the related features. At this moment, I think the only affected features are the CSS classes to show a link is active.\r\n\r\n### Why this cost?\r\n\r\nThe singleton _route is created for the _routerRoot [once](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1299). At this moment, Vue instantiates a Dep to track writes and reads on this attribute.\r\n\r\nEach time a RouterLink is created, its render Watcher detects the $route [is accessed](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1096), so that the Watcher adds the Dep to its dependencies (Watcher.deps) and the Dep adds the Watcher to its subscribers (Dep.subs). This means the Dep.subs for _route is, at least, as large as the number of rendered RouterLinks.\r\n\r\nWhen the $route changes, all the RouterLink are [updated](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L720) because they are on the Dep.subs.\r\n\r\nWhen destroying all the RouterLink (page change), all the components [teardown](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L4601) their watchers, and each watcher have to remove itself from the Dep.subs. Removing a single RouterLink's Watcher from the Dep.subs costs O(N - i), where N is the number of RouterLink and i the number of RouterLink already removed.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the cost of removing N RouterLinks at once is O((N^2)/2).\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdding a no-reactive prop on RouterLink should be enough.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this prop is effectively disabling reactivity on the current route to improve the overall performance, especially when destroying many RouterLink at once.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, this flag turns off any feature that depends on the current route. At this moment, I think the only affected features are related to the CSS classes to show if a link is active or not.\r\n\r\n**ORIGINAL LINK: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3500#issue-839908459**","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3808","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Ability to disable reactivity to improve performance on destroy - On 2.6.* \" (#3808)"},{"Id":"1454709778","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-18T10:00:30","Actor":"daniil4udo","Number":"3807","RawContent":null,"Title":"next(false) clears path on global Navigation Guards","State":"closed","Body":"@posva, sorry my bad in the example, but I found the reason behind my \"path flashes\", it's `ensureURL` method in the `HTML5History` class.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// next(false) -> abort navigation, ensure current URL\r\nthis.ensureURL(true)\r\n```\r\nIf we take a look at this method\r\n\r\n```\r\nensureURL (push?: boolean) {\r\n  if (getLocation(this.base) !== this.current.fullPath) {\r\n    const current = cleanPath(this.base + this.current.fullPath)\r\n    push ? pushState(current) : replaceState(current)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nif I try to go straight to the restricted path, at some point, in my app I have `next(false)`, that causes half-second absolutely clear URL.\r\n\r\nWhen I logged vars in this method I noticed that it pushes to `to` url WITH aborting navigation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"312\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34333374/201911818-b123d461-58d2-452d-a1a9-70094fc1576c.png\">\r\n\r\nWhen I commented that `ensureURL(true)` app worked as expected without annoying flashes.\r\n\r\nCould you plz explain why do we need it?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3807","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"next(false) clears path on global Navigation Guards\" (#3807)"},{"Id":"1449946401","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-18T07:35:36","Actor":"tachib-shin","Number":"3806","RawContent":null,"Title":"[feature or defect]: no `\\(` when opening a new group in group path","State":"closed","Body":"It sounds a little confusing, so I'm going to interpret it with a valid and invalid path:\r\n| type | path |\r\n| --- | ----- |\r\n| Valid: | `/phim/:season/:chapName(?:(.+\\)-)?:chap(\\d+)?` |\r\n| Notvalid: | `/phim/:season/:chapName(?:\\(.+\\)-)?:chap(\\d+)?` |\r\n\r\nas soon as I add `\\` first `(` to mark this as a group, vue-router error message cannot identify the group\r\n\r\nDemo: https://paths.esm.dev/?p=AAMeJRyAwQIWLALcM-BMgWII2IPZDhsDpEHIARpvUADEDwGVDdAOQJSA0QJRt1IlE8DcJkEBAAA.&t=/phim/sfweferg/tap-432#\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is a feature or a bug, but if it's a feature, please add it as noted in the document.

This allowed refactoring some options-API components to composition-api \"mode\" while keeping my test suite intact. \r\n\r\nI thought the refactor to use the official package hooks would be a simple find/replace but my test suite broke. After some digging, the reason is that the hooks implementation relies on `router.currentRoute` property and `afterEach` hook, which made the tests using the simplest $route mock as suggested in [vue-test-utils docs](https://v1.test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/using-with-vue-router.html#mocking-route-and-router) to fail. \r\n\r\nOf course there's several ways to fix it: updating the test mocks as below; setting up a router with localVue [as per docs](https://v1.test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/using-with-vue-router.html#installing-vue-router-with-localvue);  stubbing modules `jest.mock()`; etc;\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nimport { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';\r\nimport SomeComponent from './SomeComponent.vue';\r\n\r\nconst $route = {\r\n  path: '/some/path',\r\n};\r\n\r\nfunction Wrapper() {\r\n  return mount(SomeComponent, {\r\n    mocks: {\r\n-      $route,\r\n+      $router: { currentRoute: $route, afterEach: vitest.fn() },\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Question\r\n If you went this way[^1], I'm sure there are good reasons for it. I'm just curious on why didn't you go with a [similar approach as vue-router@4](https://github.com/vuejs/router/blob/5d548e34bbecb78d1764ae9027e1665ce4d46007/packages/router/src/router.ts#L1231-L1243), as in, with a reactive object derived from `getCurrentInstance().proxy.$route` as per[^2] which kept tests working without any change — but surely break some other stuff. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for your work on the router!

This allowed refactoring some options-API components to composition-api \"mode\" while keeping my test suite intact. \r\n\r\nI thought the refactor to use the official package hooks would be a simple find/replace but my test suite broke. After some digging, the reason is that the hooks implementation relies on `router.currentRoute` property and `afterEach` hook, which made the tests using the simplest $route mock as suggested in [vue-test-utils docs](https://v1.test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/using-with-vue-router.html#mocking-route-and-router) to fail. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/e3273b3db905f0d162d57725fba0c459ea5bb463/src/composables/globals.js#L23-L30\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n1. Giving a basic options API component\r\n    ```vue\r\n    <!-- using composition API -->\r\n    <template>\r\n       <div>{{ msg }}</div>\r\n    </template>\r\n    \r\n    <script>\r\n    import { useRoute } from 'vue-router/composables';\r\n    import { computed } from 'vue';\r\n    \r\n    export default {\r\n      computed: {\r\n          msg() {\r\n             return `My route name is ${this.$route.name}`;\r\n          }\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    </script>\r\n    ```\r\n2. refactoring to composition api\r\n    ```vue\r\n    <!-- Refactoring using composition-api -->\r\n    <script>\r\n    import { useRoute } from 'vue-router/composables';\r\n    import { computed } from 'vue';\r\n    \r\n    export default {\r\n      setup() {\r\n        const $route = useRoute();\r\n        const msg = computed(() => {\r\n          `My route name is ${$route.name}`;\r\n        });\r\n    \r\n        return {\r\n          msg,\r\n        };\r\n      },\r\n    };\r\n    </script>\r\n    ```\r\n3. The test that worked before, now breaks.\r\n    ```js\r\n    import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';\r\n    import SomeComponent from './SomeComponent.vue';\r\n    \r\n    const $route = {\r\n      path: '/some/path',\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    function Wrapper() {\r\n      return mount(SomeComponent, {\r\n        mocks: {\r\n          $route,\r\n        },\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    test('mount component',  () => {\r\n      const wrapper = Wrapper();\r\n      \r\n      expect(wrapper.exists()).toBe(true);\r\n      // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'currentRoute')\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n### One of The Fixes\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nimport { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';\r\nimport SomeComponent from './SomeComponent.vue';\r\n\r\nconst $route = {\r\n  path: '/some/path',\r\n};\r\n\r\nfunction Wrapper() {\r\n  return mount(SomeComponent, {\r\n    mocks: {\r\n-      $route,\r\n+      $router: { currentRoute: $route, afterEach: vitest.fn() },\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest('mount component',  () => {\r\n  const wrapper = Wrapper();\r\n  \r\n  expect(wrapper.exists()).toBe(true);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n...or setting up a router with localVue [as per docs](https://v1.test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/using-with-vue-router.html#installing-vue-router-with-localvue)... or stubbing modules `jest.mock()`.\r\n\r\n### Expectations\r\n- using options/composition-api should not affect the test suite output — implementation details?! \r\n\r\n### Reproducing Demos\r\n- Example using options-api (passing) https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-rdjvxj?file=src/views/About.test.js\r\n- Same Example using composition-api (failing) https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-exqdxv?file=src/views/About.test.js\r\n\r\n```\r\n@vue/test-utils@1.3.4\r\nvue@2.7.13\r\nvue-router@3.6.5\r\n`vitest` (can be any test runner)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Question\r\n If you've went this way, I'm sure there are good reasons for it. But curious on why didn't you gt with a [similar approach as vue-router@4](https://github.com/vuejs/router/blob/5d548e34bbecb78d1764ae9027e1665ce4d46007/packages/router/src/router.ts#L1231-L1243), as in, with a reactive object derived from `getCurrentInstance().proxy.$route` as per https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/pull/3763/commits/f1eb2b1dba9b5cc5011b230a3121c882d883c4c0#diff-2042e0452c0d0edd730403740acc8d4337382101087ad62a677e1e2fdae05e8fR8-R17 which kept tests working without any change — but surely break some other stuff. \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for your work on the router!

encountered with the store's `commit()` method when working with a list of objects, so we do not know what to make of it.\r\n\r\nIt seems like any call to `commit()` persists all pending changes to the state, even if the method called in `commit()` does not do anything.\r\n\r\nIn the example below, when editing one of the fields and clicking \"Commit nothing\", the changes are persisted in the state, even though the store's `doNothing()` method did not do anything.\r\n\r\nThe [Vuex \"Mutations\" page](https://v3.vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html) does not address this at all, hence we wonder, is this a bug or intended behavior?\r\nIn case of the latter, it should be documented and emphasized on the \"Mutations\" page, because it is very unintuitive.\r\n\r\n###

The second component falls into an infinite update loop without ever properly rendering.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe docs are unclear as to whether or not dynamic-and-async components are allowed.\r\n\r\n[The docs say say](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Dynamic-Components) that for a dynamic component, the `:is` prop should evaluate to \"either: [the] name of a registered component, [or] a component's option object\".\r\n\r\nThis doesn't allow the possibility of `:is` returning an [async component constructor](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components), which is a function returning a promise. Despite this, my example shows that a dynamic-and-async component *does* work sometimes (but only sometimes).\r\n\r\nBecause the docs are unclear, I can't actually claim that this is certainly a bug. If dynamic-and-async components are intended to work, it is. If they are not, then Vue should disallow the case that happens to work and/or print a warning in the console.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The site is deployed directly from the /client/dist folder in the GitHub repo, the contents of which were generated by running \"npm run build\".\r\n\r\nInspect the same .orbit element as before. But now, you'll find that the following line is different:\r\n\r\n    top: calc(var(--diameter-vw) - var(--orbit-diameter));\r\n\r\nThis line is not correct.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI expect the two lines to be the same. The latter should be the same as the former because they are compiled from the same source .vue file.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe CSS rule that is applied in my deployed app is not correct, resulting in breaking the visual appearance of the app.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Even though I've added some comments there I'll try and explain what this code does. I added noop beforeEach hook there because I want to prevent a resolution of the initial route meaning I don't want to show dashboard or login page before the authentication check is resolved. Only after the user is authenticated (or not) I am calling `resolveRoute` function and redirecting the user to the correct page. This worked great with vue-router <= 3.2.0, but something has changed in the newer version and I can't figure out how to fix it in my code or if it has to be fixed inside a vue-router.

This calls `beforeDestroy` of `Contact.vue` that un-registers the `contact` module.\r\n- The `changeContact` tries to call the `setContact` mutation, but, since the module does not exist, an error message is thrown in the Console `[vuex] unknown local mutation type: setContact, global type: contact/setContact`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It would be convenient if, from the outside, the difference between getters and state's properties were not visible. Getters should act as state properties in the same way that views act as read-only tables in RDBMS.\r\n2. It would be nice if part of a store, including a state and its mutations, could be provided to components as a standalone object, in the same way that we provide an object with methods in OOP programming.\r\n3. Accessing the root store from a Vuex module is a kind of recursive programming, and recursive programming is bad. Additionally, \"namespaced modules\" are a boring non-JS way to think.\r\n4. We need type inference with TypeScript.\r\n5. After trying the composition API, we love composing, and we want to compose.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice: I haven't implemented a prototype but I have implemented [the types of a prototype](https://github.com/paleo/vuex5-proposal). I am therefore able to guarantee that all the ideas below are understandable by TypeScript and can produce fully typed stores._\r\n\r\n## Solution to 1: Vuex 3 _state_ is replaced by _innerState_, then now _state_ means something else\r\n\r\nHere is a first store using a brand new `createStore` API:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst category1 = createStore(() => {\r\n  const innerState = {\r\n    id: \"1\",\r\n    name: \"Flowers\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const getters = {\r\n    double: () => innerState.name + innerState.name,\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const mutations = {\r\n    SET_NAME(name) {\r\n      innerState.name = name\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    innerState,\r\n    getters,\r\n    mutations,\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `createStore` API takes a builder function as a parameter, which takes no parameter and returns the implementation of a store object. After this function is called by `createStore`, a store object is generated from the implementation.\r\n\r\nIn our store, the **state** property is now a read-only object composed by `innerState` and `getters`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconsole.log(category1.state)\r\n// {\r\n//   id: \"1\"\r\n//   name: \"Flowers\"\r\n//   double: \"FlowersFlowers\"\r\n// }\r\n\r\ncategory1.commit.SET_NAME(\"New name\")\r\n\r\nconsole.log(category1.state)\r\n// {\r\n//   id: \"1\"\r\n//   name: \"New name\"\r\n//   double: \"New nameNew name\"\r\n// }\r\n\r\ncategory1.state.name = \"Other name\" // ERROR: readonly property 'name'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution to 2: Multiple stores can be easily instantiated using a _store builder_\r\n\r\nIf multiple stores need to be created from the same model, then use `createStoreBuilder`. With `createStoreBuilder`, the inner builder function can take any parameters. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface CategoryPayload {\r\n  id: string\r\n  name: string\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const categoryBuilder = createStoreBuilder((payload: CategoryPayload) => {\r\n  const innerState = payload\r\n\r\n  const getters = {\r\n    double: () => innerState.name + innerState.name,\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const mutations = {\r\n    SET_NAME(name: string) {\r\n      innerState.name = name\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    innerState,\r\n    getters,\r\n    mutations,\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, here is how to create the same `category1` as above:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst category1 = categoryBuilder({\r\n  id: \"1\",\r\n  name: \"Flowers\"\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated builder function simply passes all its parameters to our inner builder function. \r\n\r\n## Solution to 3: _Modules_ and _Root Store_ are replaced by _References_ to _Stores_\r\n\r\nA store is no longer a tree but a node in a network. The parent-child relationship is replaced by **references**: each store can be referenced by zero or several stores.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is how to create a store builder for blog posts, with a reference to a category store:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface PostPayload {\r\n  id: string\r\n  title: string\r\n  body?: string\r\n  categoryId?: string\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst postBuilder = createStoreBuilder((payload: PostPayload, category?: CategoryStore) => {\r\n  const innerState = payload\r\n  const references = { category }\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    innerState,\r\n    getters: {\r\n      fullTitle: () => `${innerState.title} - ${references.category?.state.name}`\r\n    },\r\n    mutations: {\r\n      SET_CATEGORY(category: CategoryStore) {\r\n        innerState.categoryId = category.state.id\r\n        references.category = category\r\n      },\r\n      SET_BODY(body: string) {\r\n        payload.body = body\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    references\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, here is how to create a store named `post1` that has a reference to `category1`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst post1 = postBuilder(\r\n  {\r\n    id: \"1\",\r\n    title: \"Post #1\",\r\n    categoryId: \"1\"\r\n  },\r\n  category1\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the store `post1`, the reference to `category1` is directly accessible as a read-only property `category`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconsole.log(post1.category?.state) // Show the content of the category1 state\r\n\r\nconst category2 = categoryBuilder(/* ... */)\r\npost1.category = category2 // ERROR: readonly property 'category'\r\n\r\npost1.commit.SET_CATEGORY(category2)\r\n\r\nconsole.log(post1.category?.state) // Show the content of the category2 state\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution to 3 (bis): References can be single stores, but also: lists, maps, and sets of stores\r\n\r\nTo illustrate that, let's create a single store `globalData` that references all the existing categories in a `Map`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const globalData = createStore(() => {\r\n  const categories = new Map([\r\n    {\r\n      id: \"1\",\r\n      name: \"Flowers\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      id: \"2\",\r\n      name: \"Animals\"\r\n    },\r\n  ].map(item => ([item.id, categoryBuilder(item)])))\r\n\r\n  const mutations = {\r\n    ADD_CATEGORY(payload: CategoryPayload) {\r\n      categories.set(payload.id, categoryBuilder(payload))\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    mutations,\r\n    references: { categories },\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, our previous `postBuilder` can be improved using `globalData` and `payload.categoryId` to get rid of its second parameter:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst postBuilder = createStoreBuilder((payload: PostPayload) => {\r\n  const innerState = payload\r\n\r\n  const references = {\r\n    category: payload.categoryId !== undefined\r\n      ? globalData.categories.get(payload.categoryId)\r\n      : undefined\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // … Same implementation as before …\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: A Map, Set or Array of references that is exposed by a store, is in fact a `ReadonlyMap`, a `ReadonlySet` or a `readonly array[]`. It shouldn't be possible to mutate these collections from outside the store implementation. Only store's mutations can mutate the collections in `references`.\r\n\r\n## Solution to 4: Types with TypeScript\r\n\r\nTyping is provided by inference:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport type CategoryStore = ReturnType<typeof categoryBuilder>\r\nexport type PostStore = ReturnType<typeof postBuilder>\r\nexport type GlobalDataStore = typeof globalData\r\n```\r\n\r\nMutations are called and typed in the same way as [direct-vuex](https://github.com/paleo/direct-vuex):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncategory1.commit.SET_NAME(\"New name\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTyping can be tested by cloning [this repo](https://github.com/paleo/vuex5-proposal).\r\n\r\n## Solution to 5: The type of the implementation object\r\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, the build function passed to `createStore` or `createStoreBuilder` must return an implementation object that follows a determined structure. Here is this structure in TypeScript syntax:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface StoreImplementation {\r\n  innerState?: object\r\n  getters?: { [name: string]: () => any }\r\n  mutations?: { [name: string]: (payload?: any) => void }\r\n  references?: { [name: string]: AnyStore | Array<AnyStore> | Map<any, AnyStore> | Set<AnyStore> | undefined }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe properties are all optional. The properties `getters`, `mutations`, `references` are dictionary (key-value) objects.\r\n\r\n## Other points to discuss\r\n\r\n### _Actions_ are moved out of the store\r\n\r\nI suggest removing actions from Vuex because they don't need to have access to the store's internal implementation. By convention, we can call **action** a function that takes a store as the first parameter, and an optional payload as the second parameter.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport async function savePostBody({ commit, state }: PostStore, body: string) {\r\n  await httpSendSomewhere({ id: state.id, body })\r\n  commit.SET_BODY(body)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is then not necessary to have a `dispatch` API. Just call the function using the correct store as a parameter when you need it.\r\n\r\n### API that are attached to the store, like `watch`\r\n\r\nI suggest that additional API that have to be attached to a store, can be grouped in a `st` property (store tools). Then, a store has the following structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ... readonly references to other stores ...\r\n  state: {\r\n    ... readonly innerState's properties ...\r\n    ... getters ...\r\n  },\r\n  commit: {\r\n    ... mutations ...\r\n  },\r\n  st: {\r\n    watch: // Here an attached API provided by Vuex\r\n  },\r\n  readonly: // see the next section\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the types of my proposal, I currently provide the typing of a `watch` object that contains a way to subscribe to each mutation. Maybe not useful.\r\n\r\n### A _read-only_ version of the store\r\n\r\nI suggest that each store provides a `readonly` property, which contains a version of the same store but without the ability to `commit`. Its structure could be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ... readonly references to the 'readonly' property of stores ...\r\n  state: {\r\n    ... readonly innerState's properties ...\r\n    ... getters ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### But what if I need the root state somewhere?\r\n\r\nNo, you don't need the whole state of your application. When you need to access the state of a particular store, just reference that store from your store.\r\n\r\n### Memory and performance\r\n\r\nAn implementation with a builder function has a trade-off: it doesn't allow to use JS prototypes, and each function (mutation, getter) has to be created for each instance of a store. I guess there is a similar issue with the Vue composition API…\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

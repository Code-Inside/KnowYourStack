component and initial data from props, but i got some issue, not sure is this a bug or just my problem \r\n\r\n![initdatafromprops](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11267832/163914896-8bdc7830-355f-4039-abc0-0dd6dc35317c.jpg)\r\n\r\ncreate a parent component like this:\r\n```vue\r\n<script>\r\nimport Child from \"./components/Child\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  components: {\r\n    Child,\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      value: \"a value\",\r\n\r\n      props: {\r\n        num: 1,\r\n        str: \"a str\",\r\n\r\n        obj: {\r\n          text: \"a obj text\",\r\n        },\r\n        arr: [\"a arr text\"],\r\n      },\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    onClick() {\r\n      this.props.str = this.value;\r\n      this.props.num++;\r\n      this.props.obj.text = this.value;\r\n      this.$set(this.props, \"arr\", [this.value]);\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n  <div id=\"app\">\r\n    <input v-model=\"value\" />\r\n    <button type=\"button\" @click=\"onClick\">Update Text</button>\r\n\r\n    <Child v-bind=\"props\"></Child>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand create a child component:\r\n\r\n```vue\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  props: {\r\n    num: Number,\r\n    str: String,\r\n    obj: Object,\r\n    arr: Array,\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      initNumFromProps: this.num,\r\n      initStrFromProps: this.str,\r\n      initObjFromProps: this.obj,\r\n      initArrFromProps: this.arr,\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  created() {\r\n    console.log(\"I am render!\");\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h4>Props:</h4>\r\n      <div>Number: {{ num }}</div>\r\n      <div>String: {{ str }}</div>\r\n      <div>Object: {{ obj }}</div>\r\n      <div>Array: {{ arr }}</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h4>Data:</h4>\r\n      <div>Number: {{ initNumFromProps }}</div>\r\n      <div>String: {{ initStrFromProps }}</div>\r\n      <div>Object: {{ initObjFromProps }}</div>\r\n      <div>Array: {{ initArrFromProps }}</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the child component, when props updated, only `initObjFromProps` remain reactive, other data types are only updated once when the component is created\r\n\r\nyou can check [initial data from props](https://codesandbox.io/s/initial-data-from-props-e3mxid)\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nKeep all data initialized from props remain reactive if props updated\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOnly object type remain reactive\r\n\r\n---\r\ncurrent my solution is add a key props in child component to make it rerender(would be go through the created/mounted life cycle again)\r\n```vue\r\n<Child v-bind=\"props\" :key=\"props.str\"></Child>\r\n```\r\n\r\nif anyone has a better way, please let me know\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This way *It will split out the initialization code of a larger chunk to avoid any additional round trips and improve performance in general*. (Read more in: [the issue in module-federation](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples/issues/375#issuecomment-707442224), [webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/#troubleshooting) and [a blog post](https://dev.to/waldronmatt/tutorial-a-guide-to-module-federation-for-enterprise-n5#host)).\r\n\r\nWhen we try this concept in Vue 2 (latest version, 2.6.14), during SSR, vue-server-renderer will complain as it expects the module export to be a function, regardless of whether it will run it in a new context or not (`runInNewContext`).\r\n\r\nSee below commit (over the vue-hackernews example project) where the issue is minimally reproduced: The server entry will simply export the function creating the app instance through an import, instead of exporting it directly: https://github.com/tameraydin/vue-hackernews-2.0/commit/074192d9da26f8d78c742acb4328468edb19806c\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThere would be no need to introduce any new API or a breaking change. We would like vue-server-renderer to support also such async initializations; in other words, to accept also `Promise` (e.g. `import`) type of exports which would then resolve to a function that it currently expects, so that the Module Federation & SSR can be fully achieved in Vue 2.\r\n\r\nWe have solved this in our local fork (through a small refactoring over [createBundleRunner](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/server/bundle-renderer/create-bundle-runner.js#L91)) with proper testing and are happy to open a pull-request - but of course, we would like get your feedback first.\r\n\r\n_**PS**.

Look up the Union type of the 'path' argument (initModule method)\r\n\r\n2. An error appears about the incompatibility of the types of arguments for the registerModule method, the typing of this method does not support the use of the Union type:` string | string[]`\r\n\r\n3. Familiarize yourself with the typing of this method by reference and match the union type to the two method declarations:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/3.x/types/index.d.ts\r\n\r\nFor more information, use the resource:\r\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html#use-union-types\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nSupport Union type: string | string[] given the already described type overloads of the registerModule method, the following errors will be eliminated when resolving the conflict:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Argument of type \"string | string[]\" is not assignable to parameter of type \"string[]\".\r\n2. Argument of type \"string | string[] is not assignable to parameter of type \"string\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen comparing the type \"string | string[]\", an error about type incompatibility is thrown, but given the type overloads, it should be possible to put an argument with the union type.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Implemented? Library suicide pact?\r\n\r\nAll this boilerplate code just to set up two-way data binding is abomination.Maybe it's too late already, looking at popularity graphs. Anyone that watches a tutorial on databinding with vuex will surely have puked and ran away. It's a shame. \r\n\r\nIf there is no better concept, just create all these mindless getter setter and mutator methods IMPLICITLY unless definedI. I perhaps fail to understand how that is not better in any case (if properly communicated that this happens).\r\n\r\nI think C# does something similar:\r\n\r\nC# property sample:\r\n`public int Age { get; set; } `\r\n\r\nIs the **same** as:\r\n`private int age;`\r\n`public int Age`\r\n`{`\r\n `   public get { return this.age; }`\r\n`    public set { this.age = value; }`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\n\r\nBtw, if you want read only, in C# you can make the setter private for example:\r\n`public string Age { get; private set; }`\r\n\r\nWorks since 2012 or so. But what do they know about creating a popular language.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSimply generate the default boilerplate getter setters and mutations (on build),  if the user doesn't define any.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Warning gets shown `\"[Vue warn]: Failed to mount component: template or render function not defined.\"` on every change\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNo warnings about failed mounting attempts as it seems to be workings without a template or render function. Also, the mixin-related examples in the official documentation don't use templates, so there shouldn't be a warning like this at all. Otherwise, it should be already shown when the app gets bootstrapped and not only on subsequent file changes.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nI'm not sure, but this behavior and warning logs seem to be inconsistent with this error message. It should be either shown all the time or never.\r\n\r\n_Edit: Renaming the mixin's file extension to `.js/.ts` (instead of `.vue`) has solved the issue, and the warning doesn't get shown anymore. However, it's still confusing, in my opinion, that it doesn't get logged right away and only after a change since the mixin's functionality doesn't seem to be directly affected by this._\r\n\r\n_It might be worth also adding a note about this to the documentation unless I have missed it._\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

My answer to that would be it would make Vuex significantly more developer-friendly and make a significantly better developer experience. Which is the reason why Vue was created in the first place - to create a approachable/developer-friendly way to build user interfaces. A bunch of people agreed that the feature would be a good thing. Closed.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/is-it-possible-to-declare-a-watcher-inside-a-vuex-store/50375  \r\n@mikepatton75 asks if it's possible. The answer is no. Then a bunch of talk about his use-case which didn't need to happen if Vuex just had a watch option, right? Either way, there is no discussion as to WHY the feature isn't available in the Vuex API. So, that's a dead-end as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/vuex-can-i-use-watch-feature-inside-a-vuex-module/75633  \r\n@lwxbr says he does an \"extensive workaround\" to make a watcher in a store for his use-case, then opens an issue.  But, all he needed was a just simple watcher, right?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1624  \r\n@lwxbr opens the issue. Closed with reference back to #1219 that didn't have an answer.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/can-a-vuex-module-register-a-watcher-to-watch-its-local-state/8003  \r\n@jri asks if a store can watch its own state, but with an obscurely worded question about a circular file import that is pretty easy to fix with using a 3rd file. But, it never got answered, probably because the question was too obscure? But, perhaps the reason why it was obscure was probably because @jri just needed a simple watcher, but didn't have it, so it was hard to explain the problem in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nPlenty of people have already done this and have been ignored. So, that has proven to be unproductive. I'm simply asking a question \"why\" and am requesting an answer and/or productive discussion about it so that developers who have the same thought in the future have a productive place to look and understand why Vuex doesn't have a watch option.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to hear from a creator of Vuex with in-depth knowledge about Vuex/Vue as well as the philosophies behind them.\r\n\r\nPlease do not give just a random answer like, \"it's not necessary\" because, don't forget, Vue \"isn't necessary\" either. Let's all use Vanilla! \r\n\r\nI myself am a creator of a UI framework that I designed for beginner developers to learn JavaScript while also making UI frameworks easier to learn later on down the road. I've even taught Vue+Vuex to an entire development team at a company. So, I know how important the core philosophy of a library is.\r\n\r\nI have utmost respect for the developers of Vue and Vuex for making such incredible libraries, and I would hope to have that respect reciprocated with an actual productive discussion into this core feature.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I've included code for the working and non-working portions.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI would expect that the map* methods in Vuex4 can be utilized in a computed method so that the get/set methods properly execute getters/setters from the store.\r\n\r\nWhile I am using Quasar, as noticed in the simplified demo, using the function returned from mapGetters inside a computed property does not work and throws errors. The same goes for mapActions when used in conjunction with the set function of the computed property.\r\n\r\nHowever, the functions returned from map* work just fine when used inside of the html template.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen using functions returned from map* functions in Vuex4 inside of computed properties (get or set), errors are thrown. The biggest issues seems to be that $this is undefined, but this happens regardless of whether or not arrow functions are used in the computed property.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Let's say I have a city name and a zip code in my state. I do not want to change the zip code if the city is not within the area of that zip code. If I do that in a mutation I have no way to reject that change or to catch an error. However if I do it in an action I still need a mutation since actions cannot modify the state directly. Now my colleague is new to our huge project and doesn't notice that one must use the action instead of the mutation and causes the state to become inconsistent. Hence I propose mutations that may only be called from an action. This would enable developers to restrict changes in state to only non-breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSince I use TypeScript the obvious way to do it seems a decorator. However to maintain consistency with the api and to be pure js compatible one might introduce a whole different category (e.g. \"setters\"). If backward compatibility were not an issue this may also become the default behavior as use-cases for mutations directly in components are rare anyhow, since most data needs validation. \r\n![Infographic from the official documentation](https://vuex.vuejs.org/vuex.png)\r\n\r\nThis infographic at  seems to imply this also. However these are just proposals off the top of my head and any implementation would need careful consideration as they would deeply impact the vuex api.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

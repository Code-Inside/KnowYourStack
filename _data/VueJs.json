Some of these components have named slots. I was trying to build a render function that will accept a config object to render these components in various setups (for example, an async component set to a named slot of another async component).

Configure one of the Adobe CEP [Sample Panels](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples). The [PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel) is a good starting point as it has very clear documentation on how to [set up the environment](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel#2-enable-loading-of-unsigned-panels) for testing.\r\n1. Replace the HTML/JavaScript/CSS contents of the panel project with the contents of the [linked JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/46bfrytw/).\r\n1. Open the panel.\r\n1. Attach a debugger (with the default PProPanel setup this would mean browsing to `localhost:7777` in Chrome).\r\n1. Set the \"_Mouse > `click`_\" **Event Listener Breakpoint** in the \"Sources\" tab of the Chrome Debugger.\r\n1. Click the Vue icon in the center of the silver `div`.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nMethod bound to the `@click` handler is triggered when the image embedded in the parent div is clicked. \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe method bound to the `@click` handler is _only_ triggered when clicking outside of the parent div.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is a non-trivial bug to reproduce as the only place I've experienced it is in [Adobe CEP](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_9.x/Documentation/CEP%209.0%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md) extensions (which run NW.js under the hood). That said, it does reproduce 100% of the time there.\r\n\r\nThe debugger (CEP context) seems to show several funny things at around [this line](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/d40b7ddb8177944d1dd50f4f780e6fd92c9455c2/src/platforms/web/runtime/modules/events.js#L69) in the Vue events.js file. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. The `e.timeStamp` value **does not change** between callbacks for _different buttons/elements_.\r\n1. The `attachedTimestamp` is **_significantly_ larger** than the `e.timeStamp` value.\r\n1. The `attachedTimestamp` value _does_ change when the component is updated (the `e.timeStamp` remains identical).\r\n\r\nI should note that this affects at least [CEP 8.0 and CEP 9.0](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_9.x/Documentation/CEP%209.0%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#chromium-embedded-framework-cef) (tested in Premiere Pro).\r\n\r\n**Vue Versions Note:** This broke somewhere between versions 2.5.17 and 2.6.x. If we run a version of 2.5 (2.5.17 and some earlier versions verified), then this issue does not occur. In testing 2.6.x, we've found that this same issue occurs from 2.6.5 to 2.6.10 (latest). Versions of 2.6 prior to 2.6.5 are actually _worse_ in that the buttons basically don't work at all.\r\n\r\n**Important Note:** I should _further_ note that apparently right-clicking to open the basic CEF [not CEP] context menu will cause the `e.timeStamp` values to begin reporting as expected. Once this occurs, the buttons will _also_ work as expected. That said, we shouldn't have to instruct users to right-click prior to interfacing with the extension.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I don't know whether or not we are ok with mutating the route record inside of `History#confirmTransition`.

This allows the mutation functions to directly update the payload data rather than the state object.\r\n\r\nAs an example see [editTodo() in the todo demo](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/91f3e69ed9e290cf91f8885c6d5ae2c97fa7ab81/examples/todomvc/store/mutations.js#L17):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\neditTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n  todo.text = text\r\n  todo.done = done\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 2 downsides to this.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the function is mutating the payload and not the state. It is not clear here what is being mutated. We now need to traverse all around the app to find out.\r\n\r\nIf the payload was instead passed by value then updating the value would not actually do anything. All mutation functions would need to update the state object. This would make vuex stores more explicit and understandable as well as ensure there is a clear boundary between it and the app. \r\n\r\nThe second is that Vuex plugins cannot log the mutations to a server and replay them back later. Here is a pseudocode example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// replaying back mutation logs\r\nlet logs = await getLogsFromServer();\r\nfor (log in logs) {\r\n  // any editTodo mutations passed in below will not work\r\n  // as the mutation will update the \"log\" object instead of \r\n  // the actual todo in the state object\r\n  this.store.commit(log.type, log.payload);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm working on a plugin that does this (similar to [redux-vcr](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr)) and it would be great if there was a systematic guarantee that it would work with all Vuex stores. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExample - No changes needed\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current: n is passed by reference\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed: n is passed by value\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample B - editTodo\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current - can update payload\r\n  editTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n    todo.text = text\r\n    todo.done = done\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed - with pass by value we \r\n  // must update the state object\r\n  editTodo (state, todo) {\r\n     const index = state.todos.findIndex(t => t.id === todo.id);\r\n     state.todos[index] = todo;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

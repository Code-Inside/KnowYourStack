The reference to the `console` is missing because it is not in the scope of the component instance. Yes, you can add it to the component instance or even the global Vue prototype, but to have to do this every time you need to debug, and then remove for the sake of keeping your code clean, is needlessly tedious. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `debugger` keyword (for example within an in-template IIFE) is barely of any use because the compiled variables do not match those of the component instance.\r\n\r\nThis has been an issue for me for a while now, but I was more forgiving of it because how incredible Vue otherwise is. However, I recently noticed that [Svelte.js offers a pretty nifty OOTB feature for debugging in templates](https://svelte.dev/docs#debug).\r\n\r\nFrom their docs:\r\n> The {@debug ...} tag offers an alternative to console.log(...). It logs the values of specific variables whenever they change, and pauses code execution if you have devtools open.\r\n> \r\n> It accepts a comma-separated list of variable names (not arbitrary expressions).\r\n> \r\n> The {@debug} tag without any arguments will insert a debugger statement that gets triggered when any state changes, as opposed to the specified variables.\r\n\r\nIs there any way we can bring this into Vue template syntax?\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    {{ @debug }}\r\n    or\r\n    {{ @debug var1, var2, ..., varN }}\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This is a problem when you implement a component as a plugin. Communication between components can be handled by the subscribeAction. But retrieving data and pushing it into the state using the afore mentioned methods will not result in any data since the service does not wait for it to be completed.\r\n\r\nThis feature would be very usefull for components as plugins that can be fully compartmentalized and plugged into different applications. Configuration retrieval can then be defined in the subscribeAction allowing different implementations over multiple applications.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExample for before action:\r\n\r\nCurrent code in src/store.js line 132:\r\n\r\n   try {\r\n\r\n      this._actionSubscribers\r\n        .filter(sub => sub.before)\r\n        .forEach(sub => sub.before(action, this.state))\r\n    }\r\n\r\nShould be:\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n\r\n          async function asyncForEach(array, callback) {\r\n             for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index  ) {\r\n                await callback(array[index], index, array);\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n\r\n         await asyncForEach(this._actionSubscribers\r\n           .filter(function (sub) { return sub.before; }), async function (sub) {\r\n                return await sub.before(action, this$1.state); \r\n           });\r\n        }\r\n\r\ndispatch function should be async as wel.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

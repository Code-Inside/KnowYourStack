I had to manually edit in the issue editor.\r\n- Bug happens irrespective of whether options API with `data()` or new `setup()` composition API is used. I removed both in the repro for brevity, but you can add either one in and it still gives the same error.\r\n\r\n### How bug was discovered\r\n\r\nI ran into this error message a few times and couldn't determine the cause exactly, and it went away. Today while playing around I realized that missing directives trigger it.\r\n\r\nNote that there are some other strange error messages that I run into all the time. Sometimes Vue even says \"likely an internals bug.\" Hard to pinpoint why. I usually just edit until the error goes away. Unrelatedly, when using Vite and triggering HMR by pressing Ctrl+S, there often also strange errors. Manually refreshing the browser solves the problem.\r\n\r\nNot complaining, Vue still gets the job done well; just want to do my part and report. Also, Vue 2 was much better about this (perhaps there were more defensive checks).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This gets very difficult though if you want to edit a route that has children. Because the route's `children` property does not update when `addRoute` and `removeRoute` are used, to make a truly robust \"edit route\" function we would have to construct a new children array by searching through `router.getRoutes()` for the children's names to make sure that they still exist and are up to date. This gets even more complicated if a route's children have children. \r\n\r\nMy use case is that I and trying to dynamically disable routes based on the capabilities of an API server, and I've run into a problem where a parent route needs to be unnavigable but its dynamic routes still need to be navigable. I would like to do this by simply setting the parent route to redirect to a 404 page rather than one of its children. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would propose a router function named `editRoute` that takes an existing route name and an object of changes to make to that route\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nrouter.editRoute(routeName: string | symbol, changes: Partial<RouteRecordRaw>): () => void\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This is compounded by the (slightly unrelated issue) devtools really struggling with keeping track of state generally, and tries to cache references to dynamic modules which are not always present, causing the devtools to hang and crash.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```ts\r\ncommit('SHOW_THIS');\r\ncommit('SILENCE_THIS', null, {silent: true})\r\n```\r\nWhere only `SHOW_THIS` hits devtools/plugins.\r\nAlternatively, a configurable option in the for `Mutation<S>` following the `Action<S>` where devs can specify an object:\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n  silent: true,\r\n  handler() {}, // <= every invocation of this is by default silent\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd even better an option called `mute` or something in `Module` or `ModuleOptions` that makes silent mode the default for the whole `MutationTree`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

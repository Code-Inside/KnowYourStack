However, due to the Vue instance not being available at setup() time, the useStore method is used in place of this.$store. This requires the developer to inject their Vuex mock, rather than using the traditional instance mocking option of the vue-test-utils mount function. Provide/inject requires a key, which, unlike $store, is not visible to the end user.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExport the default storeKey.

But they are not interchangeable. To be more specific, the following mutations cannot be committed conveniently using the object-style commit:\r\n```\r\n// To use the object-style commit we'll have to rename the 'type' property in the payload\r\n// and change the logic in the mutation handler.\r\ncommit('foo', { type: 'bar' });\r\n\r\n// To use the object-style commit we'll have to give the payload a name\r\n// and change the logic in the mutation handler.\r\ncommit('foo', 1);\r\n```\r\nEven when they seem interchangeable, the payloads received in the mutation handler are not exactly the same:\r\n```\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  foo(state, payload) {\r\n    console.log(payload);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\ncommit('foo', { bar: 1 }); // logs { bar: 1 }\r\ncommit({ type: 'foo', bar: 1 }); // logs { type: 'foo', bar: 1 }\r\n```\r\nThe same is true of dispatching an action.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nLet `commit(type, payload)` be exactly the same as `commit({ type, payload })` and let `dispatch(type, payload)` be exactly the same as `dispatch({ type, payload })`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It would be convenient and consistent to be able to register plugins within a module.  The plugin should receive a store with module-scoped state, getters, rootState, etc. just like an action.

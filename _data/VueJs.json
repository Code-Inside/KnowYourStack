We abstracted it in a way that would enable us to keep the complicated functionality in reusable components, while the style of the UI and the contents of cards could be customized from a higher level view component. We were able to support the data and functionality of this pretty easily with slots and slotProps. But when it came time to style things, it got a lot harder. \r\n\r\nAnother use case I've run into in the past was redesigning an existing app that had global CSS files set in `main.js`. I wanted to be able to work on my new pages and components in the same codebase, without having to worry about inheritance issues with the old styles and without breaking every other page. So I tried to figure out how I could take the CSS files out of main, and include them on the highest level component of the old app, so I could create a new high level component with different CSS files, or just scoped styles in each component. I was pretty new to Vue at the time, but I couldn't find a way to do this. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nFor both of my use cases, a `deep` attribute on the style tag in single-file components would have addressed this. It could behave exactly like the `:deep` and `:slotted` selectors work in CSS, except this would enable both style blocks and external stylesheets to have their scope defined and it would be a cleaner way to set these styles because there would be less issues with CSS preprocessors struggling with custom selectors.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped></style>\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" deep></style>\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" slotted></style>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This was ideal because the code for controlling these attributes naturally produced a boolean value, i.e. it Just Worked. Attributes that need strings `\"true\"` and `\"false\"` were easily provided with `bool.toString()`, which made sense because HTML attributes only take strings. More on these attributes below. \r\n\r\nAlso, Vue now matches native `setAttribute('attr', false)` which results in `attr=\"false\"`, so you might expect Vue to give `null` equal treatment, e.g. `setAttribute('attr', null)` results in `attr=\"null\"`, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\n_More difficult_ because developers now have to work _against_ JavaScript to ensure their data, template expressions, methods, and/or computed properties result in an unnatural `null` value. It may seem as simple as `:attr=\"bool || null\"` but any computed or method with logic branches the dev now has to go the extra mile to ensure `null` and not `false` is going to be the final output of the branching. Also, this logic `:attr=\"bool || null\"` just makes my brain go Huh? If false give me a null? Never written an expression like that before, would hate to have to scatter that all over my templates.\r\n\r\n_More error-prone_ because the odds of a value being a boolean are very high and the ubiquitous boolean is now a liability in templates. One way to mitigate this new risk is to make all things that could be `false` be `null` instead. This avoids the possibility of another dev using something that isn't boolean attribute safe. A terrible pattern, but if it means reducing risk devs may go that route. Gross.\r\n\r\nOkay, on to attributes that take `\"true\"` and `\"false\"` strings...\r\n\r\nIt seems like what's happened is Vue has replaced some old special behavior (i.e. enumerated attributes) for new special behavior based on assumptions about the importance of a relatively small number of attributes that only take the strings `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`. In short, `\"true\"` or `\"false\"` was like a decoy that resulted in introducing odd behavior. \r\n\r\nLet me explain with some examples:\r\n\r\n- Sure, attributes like `aria-required` need a string value of `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`, however...\r\n- Attributes like `contenteditable` are likely given string values _by the developer_ because `\"true\"` and `\"false\"` are just two of several possible strings the developer can set on that attribute. Devs can write code like `:contenteditable=\"plainText ? 'plaintext-only' : 'false'\"`, so it's strange for Vue to go out of its way to cast booleans to strings for the developer to support this case.\r\n- Same story with `aria-invalid`. It supports the strings `\"grammar\"`, `\"spelling\"`, `\"true\"`, or `\"false\"`. The developer will supply one of the four strings, not one of two strings or a boolean. Yes, someone could write the latter, but you see where I'm going.\r\n- Same again for `aria-haspopup`, which supports **7** different string values, including true and false.\r\n- And then there's `aria-expanded` and `aria-pressed`, which support `\"true\"`,  `\"false\"`, and `\"undefined\"` (pressed also supports a fourth string `\"mixed\"`). But if I give Vue `undefined` it doesn't cast it to a string like it does for `false` it _removes_ that attribute, which made sense in Vue 2 but not now. Vue requires the developer to supply the string `\"undefined\"`, but casts `false` for them. Vue does this because it mistakenly believes there's something special about attributes that take `\"true\"` or  `\"false\"` strings. This is not great and it's made even more weird because `setAttribute('attr', undefined)` normally results in `attr=\"undefined\"`.\r\n\r\nI think true and false string values can be awkward to reason about at first, so I can emphasize, but developers are now put in an even more awkward situation trying to ensure `false` becomes `null` as well as navigating what Vue will and won't do for them in regards to casting strings for attributes.\r\n\r\n**The fix** \r\nDevelopers are required to provide whatever string their attributes need, including the not special `\"true\"` and `\"false\"` strings, while Vue reserves the power of `false` (and `null` or `undefined`) to remove attributes.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```html\r\nThese three values remove the attribute (uses removeAttribute('attr')) \r\n<div :attr=\"false\"> => <div>\r\n<div :attr=\"null\"> => <div>\r\n<div :attr=\"undefined\"> => <div>\r\n\r\nTrue adds an attribute with no value, i.e. a boolean attribute  (using setAttribute('attr', '') not setAttribute('attr', true))\r\n<div :attr=\"true\"> => <div attr>\r\n\r\nEverything else (same as setAttribute('attr', val))\r\n<div :attr=\"'true'\"> => <div attr=\"true\">\r\n<div :attr=\"'false'\"> => <div attr=\"false\">\r\n<div :attr=\"'null'\"> => <div attr=\"null\">\r\n<div :attr=\"'undefined'\"> => <div attr=\"undefined\">\r\n<div :attr=\"0\"> => <div attr=\"0\">\r\n<div :attr=\"''\"> => <div attr=\"''\">\r\n<div :attr=\"'hi'\"> => <div attr=\"'hi'\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, I am unable to find mutations nor actions.\r\n\r\nI first tried to set namespace to false, the mutations and actions were not registered as global mutations and actions. (There are no such mutations or actions at all)\r\n\r\nI then tried to set namespace to true, the mutations and actions were not registered as namespaced mutations and actions neither. (```this.$store.commit('moduleName/mutationName')``` doesn't work; an error message pops up: ```[vuex] unknown action type: categories/getAllCategories```)\r\n\r\nI tried to debug by printing out the 'categories' module object and the store object and I found that:\r\n\r\n 1. Modules themselves are correctly defined. Mutations and Actions are correctly defined in the module object.\r\n 2. Module states are correctly registered in store.state (as per previously tested)\r\n 3. Module mutations and actions are not correctly registered in ```store._mutations``` and ```store._actions``` (no matter the modules are namespaced or not, the mutations and actions don't appear as global or namespaced properties); ```store._mutations``` and ```store._actions``` show as empty objects. \r\n 4. Modules can be seen in ```store._modules.root._children``` and ```store._modules.root._rawModule```\r\n\r\nThe result of console.log(categories) and console.log(this.$store) are shown: \r\n[![console.log(categories)][1]][1]\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n[![console.log(this.$store)][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone help me to solve the issue?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

'/var/www/vhosts/yourwebsite/httpdocs/resources/js'\"\r\n- Change \"import { createStore } from 'node_modules/vuex/types/index';\" to \"import { createStore } from 'vuex';\"\r\n- \"npm run watch\" now works BUT autocompletion for the \"store\" is no longer available\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n\"npm run watch\" should work simultaneous with autocompletion\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n\"npm run watch\" works or autocompletion works, not both\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

While Vuex have a great API reference and guides to help users use this API, we are left to experiment with Vuex for everything higher-level. For instance:\r\n- What are good ways to handle the loading state of asynchronous actions?\r\n- What about errors? Can we store instances of Error in the state?\r\n- Can we store functions in the state?\r\n- How can we deal with data that expires or needs refreshing either periodically or on read?\r\n- Are getters that returns a promise a good idea?\r\n- Is a side effects pattern like in @ngrx/effects by using `subscribe` a good idea or is it conflicting with \"the Vuex way\" of doing things?\r\n- What about performance? Are there some best practices to respect to keep it fast?\r\n- What about normalization of data? Any patterns to help with this?\r\n- Are configurable modules created via a factory function a good idea? How does it play with using a function to declare the state?\r\n\r\nBy reading the doc, you can find some answers to those questions but they are often buried down in examples to the existing reference instead of surfaced in a nice section similar to Redux's documentation. These are all questions that are mostly left with either unclear answers or would require experimentation on the user's side, while I feel like they should all have been answered already.\r\n\r\nFor my part, most of my experience has been with NgRx, and while I have used Vuex in the past, I can't stop thinking that I might have used it in a terribly wrong manner.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI wish to see an additional section added to the Vuex's guides. Something that is less about _what_ API to use and more about _why_ and _how_ you want to use this API. A good first candidate to move over there is the `Advanced > Form Handling` section which already talk about \"the Vuex way\" of doing things. Then, I would love to see similar examples posted for the various questions I mentioned above. All things that would benefit to be, if not standardized, at least suggested as patterns that people could start to expect to see in Vuex applications.\r\n\r\nI would gladly provide some answers to those questions by myself, but like I mentioned already, I found most of them through experimentation and I honestly don't feel like I would recommend most if not any of my answers to someone else... (which is just one more reason to have a central place for those patterns, really...)\r\n\r\nJust looking around, the idea of standardizing how various things gave rise to multiple interesting projects within Redux, like the flux standard action, and then redux-actions, redux-promise and redux-rx or redux-toolkit. I expect such documentation could probably spur some similar efforts in Vuex, or at least help point out some existing third party efforts that might be good solutions to those common problems.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

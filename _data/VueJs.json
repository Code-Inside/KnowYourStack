The code that produces the error is `var newStack = error.stack.split('\\n');`. `error.stack` is `undefined`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction createRouterError (from, to, type, message) {\r\n  var error = new Error(message);\r\n  error._isRouter = true;\r\n  error.from = from;\r\n  error.to = to;\r\n  error.type = type;\r\n\r\n  var newStack = error.stack.split('\\n');\r\n  newStack.splice(1, 2); // remove 2 last useless calls\r\n  error.stack = newStack.join('\\n');\r\n  return error\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn chrome, it has the value of the stack property.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn IE, the stack property is undefined.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the following reference documentation, the stack property is called a non-standard property.\r\n\r\nError.prototype.stack (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/stack)\r\n\r\n> **Non-standard**\r\n> This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen handling the stack in the createRouterError function, it seems that you need to handle the exception for null or undefined.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAny other ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nWhen handling the stack in the createRouterError function, it seems that you need to handle the exception for null or undefined.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe following error is output in the **IE 11 browser** console.\r\n\r\n> You cannot get the 'split' property, which is an undefined or null reference.\r\n\r\nThis error occurs when there is code that redirects from the navigation guard to the login page.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Right now the use of [generic parameter defaults](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-3.html#generic-parameter-defaults) in helper.d.ts only requires Typescript 2.3._\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the typings of `Store`. Right now, given code like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet moduleC = {\r\n    state() {\r\n        return {\r\n            valueC: -13\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet moduleA = {\r\n    state() {\r\n        return ({\r\n            valueA: \"6\",\r\n        })\r\n    },\r\n    modules: {\r\n        c: moduleC,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet moduleB = {\r\n    state: {\r\n        a: 36,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n    state: () => ({\r\n        foo: 6\r\n    }),\r\n    modules: {\r\n        a: moduleA,\r\n        b: moduleB,\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould result in the type of `store.state` to only consider the local state in the root. Also `store.state` would be typed as a function and not as its return type. With this PR the type of `store.state` will correspond to\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    foo: number;\r\n    a: {\r\n        valueA: string;\r\n        c: {\r\n            valueC: number;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    b: {\r\n        a: number;\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nWe provided defaults for new generics, therefore one should be able to still use the types as before.\r\n\r\n### About older TS versions\r\nThere seems to be a strange bug in older versions of Typescript. Sometimes the type of a store differs depending on wheather you use the `{ state() { return {...}}, ... }` or the `{ state: () => ({...}), ... }` syntax. Its not that much of a problem though. We tested the typings in 2.8.4 and the only thing that happens was that the properties are missing, but TS does not throw an error (as long as you don't try to access one of these properties) In newer versions of Typescript everything is fine.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1797","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support modules and state functions in Store typings\" (#1797)"},{"Id":"653914558","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T09:43:48","Actor":"ohdnf","Number":"1795","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix link typo in Korean README","State":"closed","Body":"Remove duplicated parenthesis of link to \"Scrimba\" in Korean README markdown file.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1795","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix link typo in Korean README\" (#1795)"},{"Id":"653096417","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T08:25:15","Actor":"zaffsite","Number":"1794","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vuex data remains undefined when called in private/incognito mode","State":"closed","Body":"**Version**\r\n3.1.1\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nHard to explain and reproduce, only in incognito mode with Firefox 78.0.1, for a few reasons, it doesn't always happen.\r\n\r\n**What is expected?**\r\nData cannot be undefined because a default data has associated them, but remains undefined, or it is a setter problem.\r\n\r\n**What is actually happening?**\r\nSome data are and stay undefined.\r\n\r\nNo problem in normal navigation mode.\r\nHas anyone ever had this problem ?\r\n\r\nThanks","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1794","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Vuex data remains undefined when called in private/incognito mode\" (#1794)"},{"Id":"651089103","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T17:24:04","Actor":"samuelgozi","Number":"1793","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix code inconsistencies","State":"closed","Body":"I fixed some code inconsistencies in the English documentation.\r\nPlease let me know if ane changes are needed.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1793","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix code inconsistencies\" (#1793)"},{"Id":"650694251","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-04T03:17:41","Actor":"mattnathan","Number":"1792","RawContent":null,"Title":"Slow registerModule when the module has getters","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n3.5.1\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://jsfiddle.net/qaL8f36y/](https://jsfiddle.net/qaL8f36y/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n0.

However, due to the Vue instance not being available at setup() time, the useStore method is used in place of this.$store. This requires the developer to inject their Vuex mock, rather than using the traditional instance mocking option of the vue-test-utils mount function. Provide/inject requires a key, which, unlike $store, is not visible to the end user.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExport the default storeKey. For devs who use the default storeKey rather than providing a custom key on plugin installation, this will provide a more durable testing solution. While the key is currently the string \"store\", this could change in the future, leaving end users with unexpected failing tests. Vue-router has similarly exported their provide keys.

","State":"closed","Body":"Quite often we are handling situations that require an optional state. \r\n\r\nE.g., my state might look like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport type State = {\r\n  isAuthenticated: boolean\r\n  account?: Account\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe initial state will always be initialized with `isAuthenticated: false`. However, we assume that account will always be set in case a user logs in to our system. The user gets fetched during the login process.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we are writing getters in a very simple an lean way, e.G.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  getAccount(state: State): Account | undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach would require us to either check if the return value of getAccount is `Account` or `undefined` in our consuming components, or we would need to use type assertion ( `const account = store.getters.getAccount as Account` ) which I think is a very bad practice.\r\n\r\nMy current approach would validate inside the getter if  the state is set and throw an error if it isn't, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetAccount: (state) => {\r\n  if(!state.account) {\r\n    throw new Error(\"Account isn't set\")\r\n  }\r\n  return state.account\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would enable me to globally catch errors that occurre in getters rather than handling it in every single component.\r\n\r\nWhat are the best practices of handling optional state in getters? Am I going down the wrong path?\r\n\r\nThank you","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1923","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Best Practice: Should we throw errors in getters if the state is undefined? \" (#1923)"},{"Id":"773061201","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T10:09:24","Actor":"Xenonym","Number":"1912","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix broken anchor link","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1912","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix broken anchor link\" (#1912)"},{"Id":"772127042","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T10:05:30","Actor":"Alanscut","Number":"1908","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: todomvc case failed in windows and some linux os (#1899)","State":"closed","Body":"As `clear-completed button`  is part of `footer`, although we expect `await click('footer')` will trigger the `footer` element, however it actually triggered the `clear-completed button`, so the next asserts will failed. 4.0 branch has the same problem.\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/c9dbb13d4138d0e7d82d103dd3275fc18fa72d28/test/e2e/todomvc.spec.js#L123-L125\r\n\r\nchange click `footer` to `.todo-count` will make sure test cases pass, which could fix #1899.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1908","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: todomvc case failed in windows and some linux os (#1899)\" (#1908)"},{"Id":"773567409","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-04T10:52:03","Actor":"peter50216","Number":"1916","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(typescript-support): fix .js in comment","State":"closed","Body":"The extension should be .ts instead of .js, since the file is in TypeScript.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1916","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(typescript-support): fix .js in comment\" (#1916)"},{"Id":"772135636","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-04T10:04:06","Actor":"Alanscut","Number":"1910","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix #1909: single quotes cannot be identified in package.json of the Windows OS","State":"closed","Body":"Fix #1909 ","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1910","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix #1909: single quotes cannot be identified in package.json of the Windows OS\" (#1910)"},{"Id":"772133480","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-04T10:04:06","Actor":"Alanscut","Number":"1909","RawContent":null,"Title":"Single quotes cannot be identified in package.json of the Windows operating system.","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n4.0.0-rc.2\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/c9dbb13d4138d0e7d82d103dd3275fc18fa72d28/package.json#L33](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/c9dbb13d4138d0e7d82d103dd3275fc18fa72d28/package.json#L33)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nyarn run test:e2e\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nAll tests pass\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nConsoling an error: ''jest' is not an internal or external command, nor is it an executable program or batch.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

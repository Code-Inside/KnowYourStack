But if one wants to use `onCleanup`, this approach does not work well: `onCleanup` of previous run is called even if custom equality determines that nothing should be done.\n\nI have the following use case, where I want to reactivity fetch data from the server if and only if fetch URL changes (slightly abridged):\n\n```ts\nconst doc = ref<DocType | null>(null)\n\nwatch(\n  [() => props.params, () => props.name, () => props.query],\n  async ([params, name, query], [oldParams, oldName, oldQuery], onCleanup) => {\n    // Do nothing if nothing changed.\n    if (isEqual(params, oldParams) && isEqual(name, oldName) && isEqual(query, oldQuery)) {\n      return\n    }\n\n    const abortController = new AbortController()\n    onCleanup(() => abortController.abort())\n\n    const newURL = router.resolve({\n      name,\n      params,\n      query,\n    }).href\n\n    try {\n      const response = await getURL(newURL, abortController.signal)\n      if (abortController.signal.aborted) {\n        return\n      }\n\n      doc.value = response.doc\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (abortController.signal.aborted) {\n        return\n      }\n      console.error(error)\n      return\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    immediate: true,\n    deep: true,\n  },\n)\n```\n\nThe issue is that `params` and `query` are objects and even if their contents do not change really, but they are just recreated (e.g., inside a template with something like `:query=\"{id: value}\"`), the watch triggers. Fine, I do deep comparison with `isEqual` but the issue is that `onCleanup` aborts the previous request even if `isEqual` determines that nothing has changed and nothing should be done (so existing in-flight non-aborted-yet fetch should continue to run and finish and update doc ref).\n\nNow, there are few approaches I could take, like doing `JSON.stringify` on query and params to get a simple string as a reactive value so that existing strict equality would work correctly.\n\nOr I could move `abortController` to external-to-the-watch variable and be smart to call it only if params change. But then I also have to call it when any outside scope gets destroyed and I have to keep track of that.\n\nI think the easiest and cleanest and more readable would be if I could provide my own equality function. Something like:\n\n```\n  {\n    immediate: true,\n    deep: true,\n    equals: isEqual\n  },\n```\n\nThen it would be easy and clear to anyone reading the code, what is the idea here.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/13242","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Custom equality for watch\" (#13242)"},{"Id":"2918974739","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-14T03:44:47","Actor":"adamreisnz","Number":"13241","RawContent":null,"Title":"Custom error handler causing recursive error handling leading to Maximum call stack size exceeded error","State":"open","Body":"Looking at the code for `callWithErrorHandling`, it has a `try/catch` block which will call `handleError` when an error occurs.\n\nHowever, `handleError` will then try to process the error with `callWithErrorHandling` again, which leads to infinite recursion, causing `RangeError\nMaximum call stack size exceeded`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaae43d8-c6c5-41bf-8bc5-998b216d45a6)\n\nAside from making sure the custom error handler doesn't ever throw any errors, can we maybe prevent within Vue that `callWithErrorHandling` will not be called again recursively if it itself has errored?","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/13241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Custom error handler causing recursive error handling leading to Maximum call stack size exceeded error\" (#13241)"},{"Id":"2903632422","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-09T10:45:34","Actor":"sebbayer","Number":"13240","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vue-specific attributes are invalid html","State":"closed","Body":"The attributes `true-value` and `false-value` on `<input>` fields are vue-specific according to the documentation: \n\nhttps://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/forms#checkbox-1\n\nHere's a playground link\n\nhttps://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9UcFOwzAM/ZUol4K0dRLjNG1IgHaAAyDgGAmVzi0ZaRIlTtlU9d9xUnXbYdrNee/Zfi/u+L21eRuAL/jSl05aZB4w2DuhZWONQ9YxBxXrWeVMwzKSZkILXRrtkaGpawVsFSVX2R58di30cjYMohH0QGisKhDoxZZS24BUMNxbWAle/kD5+212gkewnTZmA4rwYe6AogswbQsVYgOtGNCqUP4IayM4m8UVrOtGV30fvZzs5xOOnoxXss633mjK3MUW8mEaKxW4V4uSggm+YImJXKGU+XtOWLQyGfHk/Qy+9RRnQcWbAw+upRgHDgtXAw70+uMFdlQfSAofYugL5Dt4o0L0OMgegt6Q7RNdcvuULid1/enXOwTtx1DRaFT2SS84XfPxQvSj3Xl+m/qE7ukXv1pwcSZ9IBH5zZz3/7phwkk=\n\nHowever, the markup rendered is invalid because of those attributes.\n\nGo to https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea\n\nAnd validate this string\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"\">\n<head>\n<title>Test</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" true-value=\"yes\" false-value=\"no\">\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nI dont't know if more internal attributes besides `true-value` and `false-value` exist.\n\nCould this be fixed by using data attributes instead?

However, when we replace the last `B' with a 'b', the text field will change to 'FOOb', but the event handler (`handleInput`) will not change the vue model, and therefore not update the component. Now, the internal data model and the DOM are inconsistent\n\n# Discussion\nThis is a rare and subtle (and therefore, I think dangerous) bug that can result from this pattern. ReactJS does not have this problem (see above example). What I think ReactJS does is that it will update the DOM with the vDOM for the DOM element that triggered the event. I think this makes a lot of sense since DOM element events can be the source of internal state changes (like the value of a text field), but those events do not always trigger re-renders in the frameworks (since state changes may not happen, as demonstrates above). In this edge case, a state change in a DOM element without an associated state change in the VueJS framework can cause inconsistencies.\n\n# Some background\n\nWe hit the same issues in a Python framework called [Solara](https://github.com/widgetti/solara/) which is similar to React, and we were comparing how other frameworks solve this problem. We found that SolidJS and VueJS have this issue, while ReactJS does not. In the end, we use a solution similar to ReactJS in our underlying framework: https://github.com/widgetti/reacton/pull/45 \n\n\n# Proposed solution\n\nVueJS should always update the DOM element that triggered an event if, after handling its event handlers, it did not trigger a rerender.\n\n\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/13237","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bug: Controlled components can lead to an inconsistent state between Vue and DOM\" (#13237)"},{"Id":"2884048857","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-28T01:56:48","Actor":"Lmangoxx","Number":"13236","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot load extension with file or directory name _plugin-vue_export-helper.js.

Open base url of project (printed in console)\r\n2. Click on \"Go to Test Component\"\r\n3. Click on Home\r\n4. Open developer tools and take a heap snapshot\r\n![take_heapsnaphot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e85d8d20-7f53-4cb2-97a0-21a51a0f1504)\r\n\r\n5.

Take another heap snapshot and filter for \"Object retained by detached DOM nodes\" again\r\n9.

When running in development mode, the server's memory continued to rise with usage, whereas in production mode, it didn't happen.\r\n\r\nRan a profiler via Chrome's devtools and noticed that in development mode, there were large memory allocations for the __VUE_DEVTOOLS_PLUGINS__.  We also use vue-i18n and vue-router which also register devtools plugins when running in development mode.\r\n\r\nHowever, those other libraries make a check that they are executing in the browser or not in a Node environment, but Vuex does not.  As long as you are running in development mode (even on the server) it registers the devtools plugins.  I believe this is the cause of the sustained memory usage (possibly a leak?).\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR to fix this issue.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Use Vuex 4.0.2 with Vue 3 with SSR on a Node server process while running with NODE_ENV=development\r\n2. Make sure the usage includes registering store modules at runtime\r\n3. Notice that as the server processes more requests that use Vuex, the memory used by the server will rise and not come down.\r\n4. Notice that the same thing doesn't happen if you run the server with NODE_ENV=production\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nVuex not to add devtools on the server (even if NODE_ENV=development), client-side is fine.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Validations\n\n- [X] Follow our [Code of Conduct](https://vuejs.org/about/coc.html)\n- [X] Read the [docs](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).\n- [X] Check that there isn't already an issue that reports the same bug to avoid creating a duplicate.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/2250","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vuex Devtools plugins registered on server which increases memory usage\" (#2250)"},{"Id":"2407918102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-15T05:57:06","Actor":"LiYanyan-a","Number":"2249","RawContent":null,"Title":"使用mudule，在一个模块中commit另一个模块的mutations报unknown local mutation type","State":"open","Body":"createStore代码：\r\nimport getters from './getters'\r\nimport modules from './modules'\r\nimport { createStore } from 'vuex'\r\nconst store = createStore({\r\n  getters,\r\n  modules,\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport function setupStore(app) {\r\n  app.use(store);\r\n}\r\n被报找不到mutation type的模块代码\r\nimport * as R from 'ramda'\r\nimport http from '@/utils/http'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  namespaced: true,\r\n  state: {},\r\n  mutations: {\r\n    SET_DATA (state, { name, data }) {\r\n      state[name] = data\r\n    },\r\n    DEL_DATA (state, { name }) {\r\n    delete state[name]\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  actions: {\r\n    async get ({ commit, rootGetters }, { category, onFinally }) {\r\n     \r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/2249","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"使用mudule，在一个模块中commit另一个模块的mutations报unknown local mutation type\" (#2249)"},{"Id":"2337846098","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T09:54:28","Actor":"cug-zgj","Number":"2248","RawContent":null,"Title":"vuex3.6.2内存泄漏","State":"open","Body":"### Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n将vuex存储的数据使用计算属性引入，使用一个局部变量引用该计算属性，页面销毁前清除vuex的数据，该数据所占用的内容无法被释放\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```javascript\r\n//test.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <div style=\"display: flex;

https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/2201\r\n\r\nThe approach taken in this change is to refactor the getter registration into its own function, and call that new method when registering a dynamic

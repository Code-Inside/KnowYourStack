Implement server side rendering in Vue\r\n2. Implement component caching in Vue\r\n3. Observe what is passed to `set` method inside `createRenderer` cache\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n\r\nAccording to [vue documentation](https://v2.ssr.vuejs.org/api/#cache) `set` method should receive second argument as a string:\r\n```ts\r\ntype RenderCache = {\r\n  get: (key: string, cb?: Function) => string | void;\r\n  set: (key: string, val: string) => void;\r\n  has?: (key: string, cb?: Function) => boolean | void;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `val` should have type `string`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n\r\nMethod `set` receives an object with this structure:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    html: '<some loong rendered html>',\r\n    components: Set(8) {\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Any additional comments?\r\n\r\nI was trying to implement Redis for component caching. But due to the type of data passed to `set` method it is impossible to parse it as a string and store it in a cache. Redis is just removing `components` property:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    html: '<some loong rendered html>',\r\n    components: {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it break `vue-server-renderer`, because it expects components to be there:\r\n```js\r\n// node_modules/vue-server-renderer/build.dev.js:8399:26\r\nget(key, function (res) {\r\n  console.log({vsr_res_components: res?.components});\r\n  if (isDef(res)) {\r\n    if (isDef(registerComponent)) {\r\n      registerComponent(userContext);\r\n    }\r\n    res.components.forEach(function (register) { return register(userContext); }); // this breaks, because components are parsed to an empty object\r\n    write(res.html, next);\r\n  } else {\r\n    renderComponentWithCache(node, isRoot, key, context);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nVue docs are suggesting that this should be possible, by even giving an example:\r\n```js\r\nconst renderer = createRenderer({\r\n  cache: {\r\n    get: (key, cb) => {\r\n      redisClient.get(key, (err, res) => {\r\n        // handle error if any\r\n        cb(res)\r\n      })\r\n    },\r\n    set: (key, val) => {\r\n      redisClient.set(key, val) // but this does not work, as `val` is an object with Set and functions instead of a string, and it can not be stored in Redis\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI implemented it like this, but it does not work. I also couldn't find any example of working component caching with Redis. Is this even possible?","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/13175","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Component caching - wrong type returned in a `set` method\" (#13175)"},{"Id":"2187932318","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-15T08:26:29","Actor":"Dimas-e63s","Number":"13177","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dynamic component not rendering slot tree","State":"closed","Body":"### Vue version\n\n2.6.12\n\n### Link to minimal reproduction\n\nhttps://codepen.io/Dimi_0-o/pen/QWPKENG?editors=1010\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

By default the input is empty and the screen display all products.  \r\nIf the user writes \"food\" on the input, the application will execute an AJAX request (to fetch products that contain the word \"food\") and the URL will be updated to `#/products?search=food`.  \r\nIf then the user reloads the page, then the application (on the `mounted` hook) will read `$route.query.search` to populate the search input (with \"food\" on this case) and to only display the products that matches the search criteria.  \r\nThe requirement I have is that if the user edits the address bar (e.g. changing `#/products?search=food` to `#/products?search=electronics`) the application should detect the change and execute an AJAX request to update the list of products.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm using a flag, to indicate when the URL was changed my code, but I would like to know if the library has some built-in method that does the same:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwatch: {\r\n  $route() {\r\n    // Check if the change was done externally.\r\n    if (!this.internalRouteUpdate) {\r\n      // Re-fetch list of products.\r\n      const search = this.$route.query?.search || \"\";\r\n      this.fetchProducts(search);\r\n    } else {\r\n      // Reset flag.\r\n      this.internalRouteUpdate = false;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n\r\nmethods: {\r\n  fetchProducts(search) {\r\n    // ...execute AJAX request ...//\r\n\r\n    // Replace URL and update flag.\r\n    this.$router.replace(newLocation, () => {\r\n      this.internalRouteUpdate = true;\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\n> On this particular case, instead of using the `internalRouteUpdate` flag, I could just simply do `if(this.$route.query?.search !== currentSearch) this.fetchProducts(...);`, however that comparison will become complex once I start adding more filtering options to the screen.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3873","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Detect when the user changes the URL on the address bar by manually typing it\" (#3873)"},{"Id":"1987910861","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-11T15:03:13","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"3872","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(deps-dev): bump axios from 0.21.2 to 1.6.0","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) from 0.21.2 to 1.6.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios/releases\">axios's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release v1.6.0</h2>\n<h2>Release notes:</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CSRF:</strong> fixed CSRF vulnerability CVE-2023-45857 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/axios/axios/issues/6028\">#6028</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0\">96ee232</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>dns:</strong> fixed lookup function decorator to work properly in node v20; (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/axios/axios/issues/6011\">#6011</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/5aaff532a6b820bb9ab6a8cd0f77131b47e2adb8\">5aaff53</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>types:</strong> fix AxiosHeaders types; (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/axios/axios/issues/5931\">#5931</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/a1c8ad008b3c13d53e135bbd0862587fb9d3fc09\">a1c8ad0</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PRs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CVE 2023 45857 ( <a href=\"https://api.github.com/repos/axios/axios/pulls/6028\">#6028</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>\n⚠️ Critical vulnerability fix.

Encapsulates a CommonRouter that handles common things about routing, exporting routes after use\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Vue from 'vue';\r\nimport Router from 'vue-router';\r\nVue.use(Router);\r\n\r\n\r\nconst router: any = new Router({\r\n    scrollBehavior() {\r\n        return {\r\n            x: 0,\r\n            y: 0\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter.authCode = '';\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\r\n      next();\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default router;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The single-page routing file references the CommonRouter, uses addRoutes to add dynamic routing, and prompts the page : \r\n`vue-router.esm.js:16  [vue-router] router.addRoutes() is deprecated and has been removed in Vue Router 4. Use router.addRoute() instead`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport router from 'lib/CommonRouter';\r\nconst LayoutView = () => import(\"@/components/LayoutView/index.vue\");\r\nconst WelcomeIndex= () => import(\"@/pages/welcome/views/home/index.vue\");\r\n\r\nrouter.addRoutes([{\r\n    path: '/',\r\n    component: LayoutView,\r\n    children: [{\r\n        path: 'index',\r\n        name: 'welcomeIndex',\r\n        component: WelcomeIndex\r\n    }]\r\n}],);\r\nexport default router\r\n```\r\n3. So use addRoute, the page directly error, prompt :  `Uncaught Error: [vue-router] \"path\" is required in a route configuration`\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\naddRoutes and addRoute One of them is available and error-free\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThere is a warning prompt when using addRoutes, and an error is reported directly when using addRoute\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

`vuex@3.6.2` for the project I'm working on.\r\n\r\nTypescript with nodenext resolution ignores the \"typings\" property completely when \"exports\" is specified, which causes typescript to complain that it can't find any type definitions for this package.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49160#issuecomment-1137482639\r\n\r\nThis should work fine on both v3 and v4, since both have the same issue with typescript and the exports object.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the diff that solved my problem:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/node_modules/vuex/package.json

These collide with using a nonce-based CSP (content security policy level 2) setup as CSP Level 2 does not have a method to whitelist inline style attributes. CSP Level 3 allows this by using 'unsafe-hashes' and whitelisting the hash-value of the generated style attribute, but is not supported yet by all browsers (e.g. Safari).

The RenderScoped component only renders this.$scopedSlots.default. The RenderBoth component renders both the $scopedSlots.default and $slots.default\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe documentation for [$scopedSlots](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-scopedSlots) points that $slots will be exposed in $scopedSlots in 2.6.0 .\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIn cases where un-named scoped and non-scoped slots are mixed in a component, the non-scoped slots are only available in $slots.default. However, when all the slots are non-scoped, they are available in both $slots.default and $scopedSlots.default.\r\n\r\n---\r\nun-named non-scoped slots behave a bit differently than un-named scoped slots.\r\nhttps://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-slots\r\n> The `default` property contains either nodes not included in a named slot or contents of `v-slot:default`\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen for scoped slots. If you try to create two un-named (or with the same name) scoped slots, one will overwrite the other.\r\n\r\nI don't think that this is necessarily bad (though I don't see why they couldn't be joined). The problem is that the `render` function is supposed to assume that all the slots are available in $scopedSlots. So then you might say that whoever is responsible for writing the slots should be aware that there is an issue. \r\n\r\nI think the compiler should either throw a warning when this might happen (it already warns you if you try to mix abbreviated default slots and named slots). Or scoped slots should allow for multiple slots with the same name (I'm not familiar enough with the internals to know if this makes sense).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, due to the Vue instance not being available at setup() time, the useStore method is used in place of this.$store. This requires the developer to inject their Vuex mock, rather than using the traditional instance mocking option of the vue-test-utils mount function. Provide/inject requires a key, which, unlike $store, is not visible to the end user.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExport the default storeKey. For devs who use the default storeKey rather than providing a custom key on plugin installation, this will provide a more durable testing solution.

But they are not interchangeable. To be more specific, the following mutations cannot be committed conveniently using the object-style commit:\r\n```\r\n// To use the object-style commit we'll have to rename the 'type' property in the payload\r\n// and change the logic in the mutation handler.\r\ncommit('foo', { type: 'bar' });\r\n\r\n// To use the object-style commit we'll have to give the payload a name\r\n// and change the logic in the mutation handler.\r\ncommit('foo', 1);\r\n```\r\nEven when they seem interchangeable, the payloads received in the mutation handler are not exactly the same:\r\n```\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  foo(state, payload) {\r\n    console.log(payload);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\ncommit('foo', { bar: 1 }); // logs { bar: 1 }\r\ncommit({ type: 'foo', bar: 1 }); // logs { type: 'foo', bar: 1 }\r\n```\r\nThe same is true of dispatching an action.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nLet `commit(type, payload)` be exactly the same as `commit({ type, payload })` and let `dispatch(type, payload)` be exactly the same as `dispatch({ type, payload })`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It would be convenient and consistent to be able to register plugins within a module.  The plugin should receive a store with module-scoped state, getters, rootState, etc. just like an action.

Use the `v-bind` object syntax on a _native element_ like `<div v-bind=\"{ camelCase: 'myvalue' }\"></div>`\r\n2.  Give the object a camelCase property\r\n3.  Inspect the element to see that the attribute converts to lowercase, not kebab-case\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIt should convert the camelCase property to a kebab-case attribute:  `<div camel-case=\"myvalue\"></div>`\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt converts the camelCase to lowercase instead, with no hyphen:  `<div camelcase=\"myvalue\"></div>`\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhy is this an issue?  It causes a problem when using scoped slots with slot props.  Slots automatically create a slot props object for bindings which converts (correctly) any kebab-case properties to camelCase.  But if you then `v-bind` the slot props to a native element, like `<div v-bind=\"slotProps\"></div>`, i.e. spreading the props back to attributes to reverse the conversion, it strips the hyphen.\r\n \r\nFor example, `<slot aria-haspopup=\"true\"></slot>`.\r\n\r\nThe attribute gets converted (correctly) to camelCase in the resulting slotProps object: `{ ariaHaspopup: true }`.\r\n\r\nThen if you `<div v-bind=\"slotProps\"></div>` in the parent slotted content, expecting it to de-convert the slot prop from camelCase back to kebab-case, it actually only converts it to lowercase instead:  `<div ariahaspopup=\"true\"></div>`, with no hyphen.\r\n\r\nHere is a demo of that:  https://jsfiddle.net/sh0ber/wavLkd9f/\r\n\r\nNotice the button's attribute is missing a hyphen.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

the warning about using v-slot if you are actually using `tag` or `event` props\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nSince `tag` and `event` have non-falsey default values, the warning will always fire with any use of router-link.\r\n\r\n---\r\nPerhaps you should just compare if the values for `tag` or `event` are non-default and fire the warning, even though this doesn't cover the edge case that `tag` or `event` are actually being passed in with a value that matches the default.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Let's say I have a city name and a zip code in my state. I do not want to change the zip code if the city is not within the area of that zip code. If I do that in a mutation I have no way to reject that change or to catch an error. However if I do it in an action I still need a mutation since actions cannot modify the state directly. Now my colleague is new to our huge project and doesn't notice that one must use the action instead of the mutation and causes the state to become inconsistent. Hence I propose mutations that may only be called from an action. This would enable developers to restrict changes in state to only non-breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSince I use TypeScript the obvious way to do it seems a decorator. However to maintain consistency with the api and to be pure js compatible one might introduce a whole different category (e.g. \"setters\"). If backward compatibility were not an issue this may also become the default behavior as use-cases for mutations directly in components are rare anyhow, since most data needs validation. \r\n![Infographic from the official documentation](https://vuex.vuejs.org/vuex.png)\r\n\r\nThis infographic at  seems to imply this also. However these are just proposals off the top of my head and any implementation would need careful consideration as they would deeply impact the vuex api.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, due to the Vue instance not being available at setup() time, the useStore method is used in place of this.$store. This requires the developer to inject their Vuex mock, rather than using the traditional instance mocking option of the vue-test-utils mount function. Provide/inject requires a key, which, unlike $store, is not visible to the end user.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExport the default storeKey. For devs who use the default storeKey rather than providing a custom key on plugin installation, this will provide a more durable testing solution. While the key is currently the string \"store\", this could change in the future, leaving end users with unexpected failing tests. Vue-router has similarly exported their provide keys.

This means that the sub being removed is always found at the very beginning of the `subs` array, so the `indexOf` call in `remove()` (https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/observer/dep.js#L28) can return almost immediately.\r\n\r\nThis is why I had to go to really high numbers of components (10k-100k) to make the problem very evident, but in my real-world application, I'm seeing this issue at 1,000 components or less (in a large data table component).\r\n\r\nNow, imagine a scenario where a complex application has a large component tree with subs to some root `theme` prop all over the place. In fact, this is exactly what happens in a Vuetify app. As components are destroyed, their sub to this root value could be anywhere in the `subs` array.\r\n\r\n---\r\nRan into this while using Vuetify, which has a subscription to `$vuetify.isDark` (saw 1700 subs), or to `$vuetify.theme.dark` (saw 1000 subs) in a large number of its components. I also saw 300 subs to `$route`, which could easily balloon much bigger if I added some router-links to some of the fields in my table cells.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Some examples: http://simblob.blogspot.com/2018/03/using-vue-with-canvas.html https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44971399/how-can-vuejs-canvas-context-be-linked-together\r\n\r\nThere are two approaches possible:\r\n\r\na) Drawing into the < canvas/> element occurs synchronously from *within* the VNode render() function, e.g. via using a computed property or simply inserting `{{render_canvas()}}` in a template.\r\n\r\nb) Drawing into the < canvas/> element occurs *outside* the VNode render() function, e.g. from within updated(), setTimeout() or sometimes asynchronously due to `await data_needed_during_draw()`.\r\n\r\nThey all suffer from at least one problem however:\r\n\r\n1) Drawing code that is executed from *within* render() is very brittle. First, a guard is needed to avoid drawing upon the first render() call, because $el/$refs have not been created. Second, drawing via $el/$refs always draws into the canvas created by the *last* render() call, so if Vue's patch phase exchanges the DOM elements, the drawings are lost. Third, even just width / height property updates during the patch phase will cause HTML5 < canvas/> objects to clear themselves, so the drawing results are also lost.\r\n\r\n2) Drawing *outside* of render(), in particular during `updated()` used to work properly (up to early Vue 2.5 IIRC), because at this point the $el/$refs are not stale and the DOM attributes have been assigned. However, since the \"fix\" to https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7573 was released, reactive property uses during `updated()` are ignored, which means people have to go back to manual tracking of all possible dependencies involved in drawing and then update a :key or call `$forceUpdate()` etc.\r\n\r\nGiven the way render()   patch are a fundamental part of the Vue core, I have a hard time seeing how a `{{render_canvas()}}` template call could be guaranteed to have a readily setup context with `$el` uptodate and with `:width`/`:height` already applied, which rules out (1) as idiomatic / recommended way to integrate < canvas/> drawing with Vue.\r\n\r\nThat only leaves variant (2) to recommend for < canvas/> drawing with Vue, but I fail to see how loosing the reactivity for drawing from `updated()` (or setTimeout() / async functions) fits the Vue spirit.\r\n\r\nWould it be feasible to add something like `vm.$reactive( () => vm.drawcanvas() )` that records reactive data dependencies on `vm` for a function call the way render() does? Or what other solutions exist that I may be missing?\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nA method `vm.$reactive(callback_with_reactivity_working)` is just one idea, I'm looking forward to read the Vue designers take on this.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The router-view does not produce a console error or warning when it has been included in the template even though it has not been provided a component to render by the router.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis issue has a lot of overlap with #2105, but this issue is focused on the developer experience rather than adding functionality to support the desired syntax. There are reasonable workarounds proposed in #2105, but they don't address the fact that developers who fall into this pattern have to spend time and effort debugging this undefined behavior due to the lack of feedback from the library. This deviates from the expectations established by the useful console warnings provided when using named routes incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSome solutions to this problem that were not explored in #2105 include:\r\n\r\n- Warning about router views with no component in the console\r\n- Adding more explicit requirements to the documentation. All router views must specify a component containing a router view to propagate rendering to child route components\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When entering the `beforeEach` callback, an error will be thrown but will work accordingly. If clicking on the current page link, there's also an error being thrown.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nTo work without error.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt works with an error\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis error happens only when using a compiler, could not make it happens in a JSFiddle.\r\n\r\nUpon inspection, the error happens since version 3.1.0. The breaking change is the use of `Promise` in the `VueRouter.prototype.push` callback. The problem might be located in the file [`vue-router@3.1.2 history/base.js#87`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.1.2/src/history/base.js#L87):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (onAbort) {\r\n  onAbort(err)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `onAbort` is equal to the `reject` function of the Promise. `err` can be equal to many things depending on what is being passed to `next()`, but there's no way that I know of to catch the error thrown.\r\n\r\nDowngrading to version 3.0.7 solves the issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This allows the mutation functions to directly update the payload data rather than the state object.\r\n\r\nAs an example see [editTodo() in the todo demo](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/91f3e69ed9e290cf91f8885c6d5ae2c97fa7ab81/examples/todomvc/store/mutations.js#L17):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\neditTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n  todo.text = text\r\n  todo.done = done\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 2 downsides to this.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the function is mutating the payload and not the state. It is not clear here what is being mutated. We now need to traverse all around the app to find out.\r\n\r\nIf the payload was instead passed by value then updating the value would not actually do anything. All mutation functions would need to update the state object. This would make vuex stores more explicit and understandable as well as ensure there is a clear boundary between it and the app. \r\n\r\nThe second is that Vuex plugins cannot log the mutations to a server and replay them back later. Here is a pseudocode example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// replaying back mutation logs\r\nlet logs = await getLogsFromServer();\r\nfor (log in logs) {\r\n  // any editTodo mutations passed in below will not work\r\n  // as the mutation will update the \"log\" object instead of \r\n  // the actual todo in the state object\r\n  this.store.commit(log.type, log.payload);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm working on a plugin that does this (similar to [redux-vcr](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr)) and it would be great if there was a systematic guarantee that it would work with all Vuex stores. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExample - No changes needed\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current: n is passed by reference\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed: n is passed by value\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample B - editTodo\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current - can update payload\r\n  editTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n    todo.text = text\r\n    todo.done = done\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed - with pass by value we \r\n  // must update the state object\r\n  editTodo (state, todo) {\r\n     const index = state.todos.findIndex(t => t.id === todo.id);\r\n     state.todos[index] = todo;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But when I wrap all my components with shadow root, I must write two or more components every time for each component, and handly write props pass rule in outer shell component, handly create shadowRoot, and construct inner component(s) mount on it.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Inner1 = Vue.extend({\r\n    props: [ 'x', 'y' ],\r\n    template: '<div> {{ x }} {{ y }} </div>',\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst Inner2 = Vue.extend({\r\n    props: [ 'z' ],\r\n    template: '<div> {{ z }} </div>',\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst Outer = Vue.extend({\r\n    props: [ 'x', 'y', 'z' ],\r\n    template: '<div />',\r\n    mounted () {\r\n        const shadowRoot = this.$el.attachShadow();\r\n        shadowRoot.appendChild(document.createElement('style')).textContent = 'css 1 ...';\r\n        shadowRoot.appendChild(document.createElement('style')).textContent = 'css 2 ...';\r\n        new Inner1({\r\n            el: shadowRoot.appendChild(document.createElement('div')),\r\n            propsData: { x, y },\r\n        });\r\n        new Inner2((\r\n            el: shadowRoot.appendChild(document.createElement('div')),\r\n            propsData: { z },\r\n        });\r\n    },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n\r\n`<shadow></shadow>` is redundancy and will bring break change by increasing reserved tag name list. `v-shadow` won't serve all case, and hard to add prop in the furthur, and also bring break change with reserved directive list. So I suggest `<?shadow>`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <?shadow mode=\"closed\" ?>\r\n        <style> css 1 ... </style>\r\n        <style> css 2 ... </style>\r\n        <div> {{ x }} {{ y }} </div>\r\n        <div> {{ z }} </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven support:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n    <?shadow mode=\"closed\" ?>\r\n    <style> css 1 ... </style>\r\n    <style> css 2 ... </style>\r\n    <div> {{ x }} {{ y }} </div>\r\n    <div> {{ z }} </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the `options.el` can be `string | Element | ShadowRoot`, and `vm.$el` can be `Element | ShadowRoot`. And `vm.$createElement` in render will be extended to allow:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction render (createElement) {\r\n    return createElement('?shadow', { mode: 'closed' }, [ ... ]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This allows the mutation functions to directly update the payload data rather than the state object.\r\n\r\nAs an example see [editTodo() in the todo demo](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/91f3e69ed9e290cf91f8885c6d5ae2c97fa7ab81/examples/todomvc/store/mutations.js#L17):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\neditTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n  todo.text = text\r\n  todo.done = done\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 2 downsides to this.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the function is mutating the payload and not the state. It is not clear here what is being mutated. We now need to traverse all around the app to find out.\r\n\r\nIf the payload was instead passed by value then updating the value would not actually do anything. All mutation functions would need to update the state object. This would make vuex stores more explicit and understandable as well as ensure there is a clear boundary between it and the app. \r\n\r\nThe second is that Vuex plugins cannot log the mutations to a server and replay them back later. Here is a pseudocode example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// replaying back mutation logs\r\nlet logs = await getLogsFromServer();\r\nfor (log in logs) {\r\n  // any editTodo mutations passed in below will not work\r\n  // as the mutation will update the \"log\" object instead of \r\n  // the actual todo in the state object\r\n  this.store.commit(log.type, log.payload);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm working on a plugin that does this (similar to [redux-vcr](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr)) and it would be great if there was a systematic guarantee that it would work with all Vuex stores. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExample - No changes needed\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current: n is passed by reference\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed: n is passed by value\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample B - editTodo\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current - can update payload\r\n  editTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n    todo.text = text\r\n    todo.done = done\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed - with pass by value we \r\n  // must update the state object\r\n  editTodo (state, todo) {\r\n     const index = state.todos.findIndex(t => t.id === todo.id);\r\n     state.todos[index] = todo;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

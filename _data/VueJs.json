callActivatedHooks","State":"open","Body":"## Summary of Changes\r\nAdded `Component[]` type annotation to the [queue](cci:1://file:///Users/pranavkumar.bandaram/Documents/vue/src/core/observer/scheduler.ts:161:0-198:1) parameter in the [callActivatedHooks](cci:1://file:///Users/pranavkumar.bandaram/Documents/vue/src/core/observer/scheduler.ts:154:0-159:1) function within [src/core/observer/scheduler.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/pranavkumar.bandaram/Documents/vue/src/core/observer/scheduler.ts:0:0-0:0).\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Refactor (code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nThe [callActivatedHooks](cci:1://file:///Users/pranavkumar.bandaram/Documents/vue/src/core/observer/scheduler.ts:154:0-159:1) function lacked a type annotation for its [queue](cci:1://file:///Users/pranavkumar.bandaram/Documents/vue/src/core/observer/scheduler.ts:161:0-198:1) parameter, unlike other similar functions in the scheduler (e.g., [callUpdatedHooks](cci:1://file:///Users/pranavkumar.bandaram/Documents/vue/src/core/observer/scheduler.ts:132:0-141:1)). This inconsistency reduced type safety and code clarity, potentially allowing incorrect types to be passed during development.\r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\nExplicitly typed the [queue](cci:1://file:///Users/pranavkumar.bandaram/Documents/vue/src/core/observer/scheduler.ts:161:0-198:1) parameter as `Component[]`. This aligns with the `activatedChildren` array type (which is passed to this function) and matches the pattern used in other scheduler hook functions, improving overall code consistency and type safety.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- [x] Ran `npm run ts-check` to verify no type errors were introduced.\r\n- [x] Ran `npm test -- test/unit/modules/observer/scheduler.spec.ts` to ensure scheduler logic remains intact.\r\n- [x] Verified that `activatedChildren` is defined as `Array<Component>`, confirming `Component[]` is the correct type.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/13292","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(scheduler): add missing type annotation to callActivatedHooks\" (#13292)"},{"Id":"3675745769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-28T19:26:33","Actor":"din-ahamza","Number":"13291","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update README.md","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE -->\r\n<!-- (Update \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box) -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [x ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ x] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [ x] It's submitted to the `main` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch)\r\n- [ ] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [ ] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [ ] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [ ] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/13291","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update README.md\" (#13291)"},{"Id":"3670096135","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-27T06:52:07","Actor":"kl2400033266","Number":"13290","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(v3): include key in inject() warning message","State":"open","Body":"Improves the warning message in the inject() function to include the key being injected.\r\n\r\nThis addresses issue #13287 where users were unable to identify which inject() call was failing without the key information in the warning message.\r\n\r\nChanges made:\r\n- Modified src/v3/apiInject.ts line 69 to include the injected key in the warning message\r\n- The warning now displays: inject(<key>) can only be used inside setup() or functional components.\r\n- This matches the pattern used in the error message on line 66\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE -->\r\n<!-- (Update \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box) -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] It's submitted to the `main` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch)\r\n- [ ] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [ ] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [ ] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [ ] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/13290","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(v3): include key in inject() warning message\" (#13290)"},{"Id":"3614935021","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-12T05:07:29","Actor":"maynkxx","Number":"13289","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: make README top-level H1 to satisfy markdownlint","State":"open","Body":"Make the README's first line a top-level heading (#) so it complies with markdownlint rule MD041 (first-line-heading).

Open base url of project (printed in console)\r\n2. Click on \"Go to Test Component\"\r\n3. Click on Home\r\n4. Open developer tools and take a heap snapshot\r\n![take_heapsnaphot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e85d8d20-7f53-4cb2-97a0-21a51a0f1504)\r\n\r\n5.

Take another heap snapshot and filter for \"Object retained by detached DOM nodes\" again\r\n9. See that e.g. the paragrpah is still being retained => paragraph element has leaked (it is detached from the DOM but is not being garbage collected)\r\n![not_collected](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be59ae12-f1b5-441a-9a4f-e9363168dd3e)\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Go to FunctionalComponent.vue to line 4 and change the parameter for functional to \"false\"\r\n11. Redo steps 1 - 8\r\n12. See that there are not detached elements (even without manually garbage collecting) => all elements have been properly garbage collected\r\n![no_detached](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6600139d-43b2-46d5-b955-6d92a2b2393e)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that after executing steps 1-8,  e.g. the paragraph element is not being retained anymore and has been garbage collected independent of the value for the functional parameter in FunctionComponent.vue\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInstead the paragraph element is being retained when using `functional: true` and does not get garbage collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19045\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz\r\n    Memory: 6.27 GB / 23.86 GB\r\nBinaries:\r\n    Node: 18.15.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    npm: 9.5.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Edge: Chromium (128.0.2739.79)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.19041.4355\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n    vue: ^2.7.14 => 2.7.16\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3907","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Memory leak when using functional components with Vue router in Vue 2.7.14\" (#3907)"},{"Id":"2515161068","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-11T21:36:47","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"3905","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(deps-dev): bump path-to-regexp from 1.8.0 to 8.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) from 1.8.0 to 8.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases\">path-to-regexp's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Simpler API</h2>\n<p>Heads up!

When running in development mode, the server's memory continued to rise with usage, whereas in production mode, it didn't happen.\r\n\r\nRan a profiler via Chrome's devtools and noticed that in development mode, there were large memory allocations for the __VUE_DEVTOOLS_PLUGINS__.  We also use vue-i18n and vue-router which also register devtools plugins when running in development mode.\r\n\r\nHowever, those other libraries make a check that they are executing in the browser or not in a Node environment, but Vuex does not.  As long as you are running in development mode (even on the server) it registers the devtools plugins.  I believe this is the cause of the sustained memory usage (possibly a leak?).\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR to fix this issue.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Use Vuex 4.0.2 with Vue 3 with SSR on a Node server process while running with NODE_ENV=development\r\n2. Make sure the usage includes registering store modules at runtime\r\n3. Notice that as the server processes more requests that use Vuex, the memory used by the server will rise and not come down.\r\n4.

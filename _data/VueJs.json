Of course, I should have noticed the error in the console sooner, but my attention was focused on the code and results that I was trying to understand.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be looking at the old versions except that I am unfamiliar with vue and vue-router and trying to understand an existing app that uses these old versions.

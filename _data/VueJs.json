Create a custom radio component that implements a native radio input\r\n2. Use a model and a value, both on the same custom radio\r\n3. Pass on the model & $attrs to the radio\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe value is passed on as default value, and the model is still working as intended. Just like with the default Vue setup.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nSince 2.6.1 the value attr is filtered out, or is assigned to the actual value of model. Depending wether or not you have the value prop defined on the custom radio component.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This makes it impossible for users to define the structure of their own metadata. As an example, I wish to use the \"meta\" property for middleware. I've created a Middleware type and would like an interface like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare module \"vue-router\" {\r\n    interface Route {\r\n        meta: {\r\n            middleware?: Middleware[]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I try to define it this way, I get an error saying that all declarations of \"meta\" must have identical modifiers, and that \"meta\" was already defined in router.d.ts... However if I DON'T define it this way then I lose the ability to statically type check this property and catch developers who accidentally pass an incorrect type (e.g. passing a string containing the middleware's name, instead of the middleware object itself)\r\n\r\nNow there's admittedly a limitation of this. Currently, it's possible to pass a non-object for the meta of a route. If you want to stick just a number or a string in there, it's completely valid. Making this a user-extensible interface would eliminate that use case (and therefore be a breaking API change) -- but I find it highly suspect that anyone is using the meta field in that way in a production app of any meaningful size. Without key-value pairs, storing only a single string into the \"meta\" field doesn't feel very useful.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nexport interface Route {\r\n  path: string\r\n  name?: string | null\r\n  hash: string\r\n  query: Dictionary<string | (string | null)[]>\r\n  params: Dictionary<string>\r\n  fullPath: string\r\n  matched: RouteRecord[]\r\n  redirectedFrom?: string\r\n  meta?: {} // <-- replaced \"any\" with \"{}\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The component only references `state.rootObject.prop1` via a getter and a mutation to increment it. This can be seen when clicking the 'Inc Prop1' button.\r\n\r\nWhen another property is added to the `rootObject` (via the 'Add Prop2' button), the component is updated with no change to the underlying data (`rootObject.prop1`) as can be seen in the console. Calls to `incProp2` can be seen to change this new property value, but no component update is triggered (as expected). Finally, deleting `rootObject.prop2` also triggers a component update, despite `rootObject.prop1` not changing.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNone of the mutations associated with `prop2` would trigger the component bound to `prop1` to update.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nCreation and deletion of 'peer' properties of `prop1` are triggering component updates. Mutation of 'peer' properties are (correctly) _not_ triggering updates.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis could be my misunderstanding of how Vuex actually works (in version 3), but it is causing my app performance issues when unrelated changes in state are triggering many hundreds / thousands of component updates (with no visible data changing). If there is any way to configure or use Vuex, allowing properties to be added / removed _without_ causing updates of existing properties, I couldn't find it in the documentation.\r\n\r\nNote this example could easily be solved by having 2 separate state properties. But this is an example of deeply nested real-world data backed by firestore, so separating all the properties out isn't a workable solution there.\r\n\r\nI was also curious to see if Vuex 4 changed this behaviour in any way, but I couldn't find or figure out a codepen setup for Vuex 4 yet—happy to experiment if there is one.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

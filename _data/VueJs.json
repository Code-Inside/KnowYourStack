Warning gets shown `\"[Vue warn]: Failed to mount component: template or render function not defined.\"` on every change\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNo warnings about failed mounting attempts as it seems to be workings without a template or render function. Also, the mixin-related examples in the official documentation don't use templates, so there shouldn't be a warning like this at all. Otherwise, it should be already shown when the app gets bootstrapped and not only on subsequent file changes.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nI'm not sure, but this behavior and warning logs seem to be inconsistent with this error message. It should be either shown all the time or never.\r\n\r\n_Edit: Renaming the mixin's file extension to `.js/.ts` (instead of `.vue`) has solved the issue, and the warning doesn't get shown anymore. However, it's still confusing, in my opinion, that it doesn't get logged right away and only after a change since the mixin's functionality doesn't seem to be directly affected by this._\r\n\r\n_It might be worth also adding a note about this to the documentation unless I have missed it._\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Let's say I have a city name and a zip code in my state. I do not want to change the zip code if the city is not within the area of that zip code. If I do that in a mutation I have no way to reject that change or to catch an error. However if I do it in an action I still need a mutation since actions cannot modify the state directly. Now my colleague is new to our huge project and doesn't notice that one must use the action instead of the mutation and causes the state to become inconsistent. Hence I propose mutations that may only be called from an action. This would enable developers to restrict changes in state to only non-breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSince I use TypeScript the obvious way to do it seems a decorator. However to maintain consistency with the api and to be pure js compatible one might introduce a whole different category (e.g. \"setters\"). If backward compatibility were not an issue this may also become the default behavior as use-cases for mutations directly in components are rare anyhow, since most data needs validation. \r\n![Infographic from the official documentation](https://vuex.vuejs.org/vuex.png)\r\n\r\nThis infographic at  seems to imply this also.

in dev environments when setting a ref used in a component template.","State":"open","Body":"### Version\r\n2.7.14\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/relaxed-bhaskara-87nnhd?file=/src/App.vue:0-994)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nInside of a callback passed to effectScope.run and while in development mode (i.e. NODE_ENV !== 'production'), modify a value that is used in a component's template. After doing this, the effectScope will no longer be active (e.g. getCurrentScope() will return undefined, despite being within the effectScope.run callback). \r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nWithin the callback passed to effectScope.run, getCurrentScope should always return effectScope.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWithin the callback passed to effectScope.run, getCurrentScope only returns effectScope until a ref used in a component is modified. The error only occurs in dev environments. \r\n\r\n---\r\nRan into this while debugging some code that manages various composables with lifetimes not strictly tied to any particular component of the page, but where the data from these composables is used in rendering. I noticed warnings from onScopeDispose in development environments and also differing behavior of getCurrentScope() in dev vs. production builds.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the code at fault is here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/main/src/core/instance/lifecycle.ts#L393\r\n\r\nIn development environments, this function gets called when rendering is triggered (to support the onRenderTrigger lifecycle hook). It changes some global state around the active scope/component and fails to restore it if invoked from within a manual effect scope. the fuction stores the currently active component (which will be undefined within a manual effect scope), then activates the component for which the hook was triggered, then re-activates the previous component. Within a manual effect scope, this has the effect of setting the activeEffectScope global variable to undefined, despite being within a scope.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The migration is a long and expensive process. Clients don't like buggy applications. Being a small bootstrapped startup, we can't afford the expensive paid support.\r\nSo, I request for the support to be extended for another 6 months till June 2024, by then Vuetify 3 will be ready. \r\n\r\nCan I know if you will be able to extend the support for Vue 2.x in favor of people who are in similar situation like me?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGajendra Kashyap\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Encapsulates a CommonRouter that handles common things about routing, exporting routes after use\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Vue from 'vue';\r\nimport Router from 'vue-router';\r\nVue.use(Router);\r\n\r\n\r\nconst router: any = new Router({\r\n    scrollBehavior() {\r\n        return {\r\n            x: 0,\r\n            y: 0\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter.authCode = '';\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\r\n      next();\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default router;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The single-page routing file references the CommonRouter, uses addRoutes to add dynamic routing, and prompts the page : \r\n`vue-router.esm.js:16  [vue-router] router.addRoutes() is deprecated and has been removed in Vue Router 4. Use router.addRoute() instead`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport router from 'lib/CommonRouter';\r\nconst LayoutView = () => import(\"@/components/LayoutView/index.vue\");\r\nconst WelcomeIndex= () => import(\"@/pages/welcome/views/home/index.vue\");\r\n\r\nrouter.addRoutes([{\r\n    path: '/',\r\n    component: LayoutView,\r\n    children: [{\r\n        path: 'index',\r\n        name: 'welcomeIndex',\r\n        component: WelcomeIndex\r\n    }]\r\n}],);\r\nexport default router\r\n```\r\n3. So use addRoute, the page directly error, prompt :  `Uncaught Error: [vue-router] \"path\" is required in a route configuration`\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\naddRoutes and addRoute One of them is available and error-free\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThere is a warning prompt when using addRoutes, and an error is reported directly when using addRoute\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

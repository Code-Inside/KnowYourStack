This feature might be able to be used for other reasons, but it is probably truly a fix. Also, a change would need to be approved in `vue-router` as well for the memory leak there to even go away (see https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2606), and that might get fixed by other means, so this might not be worth doing anything with if that doesn't also get approved.\r\n\r\nBecause we're in control of when the app is created in SSR it didn't seem like there was any other sensible option but to give us control of when to clean it up, though maybe something can be done based on `runInNewContext`. Also, maybe a more explicit API would be better, e.g. some way to mark the app as \"served\", `$isServer && $isServed`.\r\n\r\nNote I'm submitting this knowing that there is a good chance that this will be tossed, so feel free to do so if this is not what is wanted.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/9479","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ssr): add ability to cleanup after request\" (#9479)"},{"Id":"409065622","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-12T02:14:24","Actor":"ianwremmel","Number":"9478","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unmounting a target in an event handler stops that event from propagatin","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.6.0\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codepen.io/ianwremmel/pen/omdQxG](https://codepen.io/ianwremmel/pen/omdQxG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nClick the submit button\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe page posts back to itself\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe button disappears and nothing else happens\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis changed somewhere between 2.5.22 and 2.6.0.

So it seems like I'm asking for a regression.\r\n\r\nI tried to find what formed the basis for making such a decision (to resolve them before props and data) but I haven't been able to find any related issue.\r\n\r\nI have a component `<tree-view>` that renders another component called `<tree-item>` inside. The `tree-item` may itself recursively render one or more `tree-view`s.\r\n\r\nThe `tree-view` accepts a number of options that I pass to it as props (let it be a sole option called \"mode\" for the sake of brevity):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<tree-view\r\n    mode=\"folders\"\r\n>\r\n    ...\r\n</tree-view>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `tree-view` accepts it as a prop:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nprops: {\r\n    mode: {\r\n        default: \"all\",\r\n        validator: ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I want to provide it to all the nested `tree-view`'s, so that I don't have to pass this option to the nested `tree-item` so that *only from there* it can be passed to the nested `tree-view`. But I can't do so because **the props since 2.2.1 are initialized after the injected properties**.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThat is what I'm trying to achieve\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nprops: {\r\n    mode: {\r\n        default: \"all\"\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n\r\nprovide() {\r\n    return {\r\n        /*\r\n            This one works OK, this.mode is taken from the `props`\r\n        */\r\n        mode: this.mode\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n\r\ninject: {\r\n    mode: {\r\n        /*\r\n            But this one doesn't since the `props` are not yet initialized\r\n        */\r\n        default: this.mode\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy point is that the root `tree-view` isn't provided with the `mode` injected property (because it's the root one obviously) so the warning \"Injection \"mode\" not found\" is thrown for each root `tree-view`. But all the nested `tree-view`'s *are* provided with the injected property \"mode\" so the provided value is taken instead of the `default` one.\r\n\r\nMay be (I'm not sure, just a guess) the proposed API will need to like something like\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ninject() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's that the `injected` property can accept a function as its value instead of just an array or an object.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

A runtime exception during render essentially killed it without any good way to handle it.\r\n\r\nWhenever a progress elements value is set to NaN, the Error `TypeError: \"Value being assigned to HTMLProgressElement.value is not a finite floating-point value.\"` is being listed in the console, but somehow instead of just handling this render error (handled by standard component error handler) the component and the entire application is permanently damaged after this.\r\n\r\nOf course the developer should foresee this and write it with the appropriate defensiveness, but runtime errors inside the render function of a component should not invisibly leave the entire application in a non-reactive state. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Updated source of console message\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nHandle this as a standard render exception.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue is not reactive anymore. Eg.no button has any effect anymore.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The components simply receive the props and they are not aware they come from the URL.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful if we could decouple the components from the router-view, just the way we decouple them from the URL.\r\nI think being able to map the router-view attributes to the desired component props is more appropriate and lets our components expose the interface they need to expose, rather than the interface imposed by the router-view.\r\n\r\nI think the right place for solving this problem is the route's function mode props.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe router view passes down a couple of parameters as usual:\r\n\r\n    <router-view :param1=\"value1\" :param2=\"value2\"></router-view>\r\n\r\nThe function maps the props both from the route's URL and also the `router-view` attributes.\r\nIt can also resolve conflict names between URL parameters and view parameters and determine which parameter is more important in each case.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      path: '/test',\r\n      component: Test,\r\n      props: (route, view) => {\r\n        return {\r\n          query: route.query.q\r\n          paramA: view.attrs.param1,\r\n          paramB: view.attrs.param2 || route.query.param2\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    } \r\n\r\nI have done some tests with the router's code and it seems to work fine.\r\n\r\nI would like to have some feedback from the community.

Is there reason to have this inconsistency?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem occurs when you try to watch getters\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\nwatch: {\r\n  '$store.state.user.name': {\r\n    handler(name) {\r\n      console.log(name)\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  '$store.getters[user/fullName]': { // not working\r\n    handler(fullName) {\r\n      console.log(fullName)\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCurrent solution Is to use mapGetters() helper for getters only. Why? because of weird api.\r\nPlease note that we try to avoid mapGetters, mapState helpers... due to explicitly in large app\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdd api for getters same as is for state.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`$store.gettters.user.fullName`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

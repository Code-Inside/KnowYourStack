For example when we create dynamic import \r\n```\r\nimport(/* webpackChunkName: \"somelib-locales-[lang]\" */ `somelib/locale/${lang}`)\r\n```\r\nthen we will get all files prefetched/preloaded.

I think I understand the problem and am curious about the right solution. \r\nVue currently specifies `webpack` 4.x and `karma` 3.x as devDependencies, both of which ultimately bring in `chokidar` 2.x, which lists `fsevents` 1.2.x as an optional dependency. \r\n\r\nOld `fsevents` is really the problem, in two ways:\r\n* It references entities that have been removed in Node 12.x (e.g. v8::Handle; see https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/blob/v1.2.2/fsevents.cc#L89) \r\n* It relies on `nan` 2.9.x, which also references deprecated/removed entities from the v8 API (e.g. `isNearDeath`). Newer versions of `nan` have addressed this issue. \r\n\r\nI imagine the easiest solution, assuming nothing else breaks, would be to update the `karma` and `webpack` dependencies to some minimal viable version that does away with reliance on these older libs without breaking other expectations. In the meantime, we could also put a note in the build instructions for Mac users noting that they may need to move down to Node v10 if they want to avoid this problem. I understand that this might be obvious to some audience that intends to pitch in with Vue development in the first place, but it might help some.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

In our own application we went for the third choice on the server, but had to add additional logic to prevent hydration errors and handle the history mode correctly.\r\n\r\nEither way it might make sense to go over the [official SSR guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/routing.html#routing-with-vue-router) to better communicate this issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

More than that, in case route A does not match any component, the SSR might unnecessarily return an error based on how you handle routes with no matched components.\r\n\r\nYou can circumvent this issue by using the `router.push` API, but I guess this is not the intended way to navigate within navigation guards?\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```js\r\nnext({\r\n  path: '/routeB',\r\n  ignoreRedirectErrors: true\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It could be optional like it currently is.\r\n\r\nHere's how the new TS feature would solve the remaining challenge with complete type support with Vuex:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype GetEmbeddedType<O, Path extends string> = \r\n    Path extends `${infer A}/${infer B}` \r\n    ? A extends keyof O\r\n        ? B extends keyof O[A]\r\n            ? O[A][B]\r\n            : never\r\n        : never\r\n    : never;\r\n\r\n\r\ninterface State {\r\n    prop: {\r\n        innerProp: number;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\ntype InnerPropType = GetEmbeddedType<State, 'prop/innerProp'>; // number!!\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSimilar to what exists now, just full type support to validate types, the existence of all mutations and dispatches, and communications between the root store and it' modules.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

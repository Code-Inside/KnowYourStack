In other words, the design needs the ability to:\r\n\r\n1. provide behavioral differences for (grand)children\r\n2. code-split these differences for the purpose of scaling\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** See [this comment](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/8941#issuecomment-429497722) for a valid use-case.\r\n\r\nThis can easily be solved with vue `mixins` (or `extends`) and `props` (or `inject`) for a single level hierarchy, but things get complicated when trying to create multiple levels of nesting with configuration injected from a grand ancestor, when accounting for the need to code-split.\r\n\r\n`v-if` is a nice pattern, but it requires the child component to still be loaded even if the condition will always be false. This is a non-option for us, because of the performance implications at-scale loading code that is never used. Therefore we have a need to conditionally split child components into separate bundles based on instance properties.\r\n\r\nVue provides the ability to allow behavioral differences with `mixins`/`extends`/`props`/`inject`, and also the ability to provide promises (and therefore create split points) for local component registration definitions. We have tried coming at this many different angles, but there is no apparent way to do **both** (without losing server-side rendering). More information can be found by reading the section on [async components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components). \r\n\r\n**EDIT:** It's also worth mentioning that SEO is a factor. Our application is fully universal (isomorphic) for the purpose of SEO and TTI. We do selective client lazy-loading where SEO is not important, but the typical use-case for code splitting the javascript is for the purpose of performance at-scale.\r\n\r\nThe pattern that we came up with to solve this business need looks like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- @file feature.vue, n-th level from parent -->\r\n<template>\r\n  <div id=\"feature\">\r\n    <Child/>\r\n    <div>some other feature html</div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  inject: ['flavorOfChild'],\r\n  components: {\r\n    Child() {\r\n      if (this.flavorOfChild === 'flavor 2') {\r\n        return import('./flavor-2');\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return import('./flavor-1');\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is, the vm is not actually bound to the component function, and therefore `this` is undefined. We can, however, take advantage of the component instance lifecycle to create a reference to the instance:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet _this;\r\nexport default {\r\n  inject: ['flavorOfChild'],\r\n  created() {\r\n    _this = this;\r\n  },\r\n  components: {\r\n    Child() {\r\n      if (_this.flavorOfChild === 'flavor 2') {\r\n        return import('./flavor-2');\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return import('./flavor-1');\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough the above solution “works”, it has the following limitations:\r\n\r\n- It’s a bit messy to manually manage `_this`\r\n- `created()` would otherwise not be needed.\r\n- this opens up the opportunity for possible unexpected behavior for components that may be instantiated multiple times if the instances are created in parallel with different values.\r\n- async component registration is not documented as part of the lifecycle, so there is no confidence that this lifecycle will remain consistent between versions (and thus `_this` may not be defined if Vue changes source such that `created()` happens after async components are resolved)\r\n\r\nThis is the solution we will be going with despite the limitations. There is also perhaps another way to conditionally lazy load child components that we have not considered. We did, however, try to come up with every possible design to accomplish our overall goal and could not.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** I have created a post to the [vue forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/code-split-components-based-on-instance-properties/45822) to explore different design options (the need for this github issue assumes there is no other possible design that will solve our business need).\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n  components: {\r\n    Child() {\r\n      if (this.someCondition) {\r\n        return import('./a');\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return import('./b');\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** [Here](https://jsfiddle.net/justinhelmer/wc1gd4L9/) you can see it demonstrated in a simplified form.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** [Here](https://jsfiddle.net/k1v7cLbj/7/) you can see it demonstrated with vanilla js, agnostic of vue.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a simple change given the fact that the instance exists when these component functions are executed, and it is already possible to manage the binding manually like in the earlier examples.\r\n\r\nI'd happily submit a PR but I could not find the right spot in the code to make the change.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It says \"To get around the issue, you should implement a catch-all route within your Vue app to show a 404 page\". In my opinion, that wording implies that implementing a catch-all route within Vue completely fixes the problem. However, with that approach, if a user goes to an invalid URL, the server will respond with a status code of 200 even though the URL is invalid. On some sites (especially dynamic ones), there is a good chance that a URL that is valid today could be invalid tomorrow. Maybe some search engines are smart enough to recognize that it's a \"Page Not Found\" page and treat it as such rather than a valid URL, but I'm guessing that not all search engines are that smart. I think it's important for developers to be aware of this, so I think it would be a good addition to the \"Essentials > HTML5 History Mode >  Caveat\" documentation.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe documentation should mention that the server will respond with a status code of 200 for invalid URLs.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe documentation does not mention this.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

That means the convenience is unavailable for computed properties that rely on Vuex state and methods that dispatch Vuex actions, which is a big limitation.\r\n\r\n- It requires tight coupling of components to Vuex modules, which I've found doesn't scale well to large apps. Instead, I've found it very useful to _never_ use the `mapXXX` helpers directly in my components, but in a [state helpers file](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/blob/master/src/state/helpers.js), which describes the public interfaces for all Vuex modules. From this file, I'll import the concerns I care about into individual components. For example:\r\n  ```js\r\n  import {\r\n    authComputed,\r\n    notificationsComputed,\r\n    notificationsMethods,\r\n    searchMethods,\r\n  } from '@state/helpers'\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...authComputed,\r\n    ...notificationsComputed,\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...notificationsMethods,\r\n    ...searchMethods,\r\n  },\r\n  ```\r\n  This prevents verbose and duplicated `mapXXX` code in components, replaced by a nice list of the global concerns this component cares about. But the benefit _really_ comes in when adding new state/getters/actions or when refactoring a Vuex module. For example, if I add a new `userLoggedIn` getter to `authComputed`, it will automatically be available in any component using `authComputed`. Or, if I rename some state or split it out into additional modules, the state helpers file allows the refactor to be done in two steps: first on the Vuex side, while updating the state helpers for compatibility, _then_ in my components (if I actually want the public interface to change as well).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I feel like the `mapXXX` helpers should stay and the scoped slot pattern should actually be avoided.

It provides a few code snippets and assumes you'll understand. The documentation has been the biggest source of my frustration while using Vue since it never actually explains anything.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the Vuex installation page, sandwiched between CDN/package manager installation and building from source, you've put that Vuex needs to be instantiated in a module set up. You've provided zero context for this. Is this in the store? Is this for every file you need to access the store in? More importantly, it shouldn't be on the installation page, let alone sandwiched in between different installation methods. Vue's documentation is riddled with these issues. Unfortunately, I still don't actually know enough about how Vue actually works to be able to contribute to the documentation in any way. If I didn't have to use Vue for the project I am on, I would be using React, Redux, & RxJs and have access to meaningful, better written documentation that bothers to walk you through the set up. If Vue actually wants to gain any real traction, you're going to need to actually show folks how to use and set up your tools.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

component and initial data from props, but i got some issue, not sure is this a bug or just my problem \r\n\r\n![initdatafromprops](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11267832/163914896-8bdc7830-355f-4039-abc0-0dd6dc35317c.jpg)\r\n\r\ncreate a parent component like this:\r\n```vue\r\n<script>\r\nimport Child from \"./components/Child\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  components: {\r\n    Child,\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      value: \"a value\",\r\n\r\n      props: {\r\n        num: 1,\r\n        str: \"a str\",\r\n\r\n        obj: {\r\n          text: \"a obj text\",\r\n        },\r\n        arr: [\"a arr text\"],\r\n      },\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    onClick() {\r\n      this.props.str = this.value;\r\n      this.props.num++;\r\n      this.props.obj.text = this.value;\r\n      this.$set(this.props, \"arr\", [this.value]);\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n  <div id=\"app\">\r\n    <input v-model=\"value\" />\r\n    <button type=\"button\" @click=\"onClick\">Update Text</button>\r\n\r\n    <Child v-bind=\"props\"></Child>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand create a child component:\r\n\r\n```vue\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  props: {\r\n    num: Number,\r\n    str: String,\r\n    obj: Object,\r\n    arr: Array,\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      initNumFromProps: this.num,\r\n      initStrFromProps: this.str,\r\n      initObjFromProps: this.obj,\r\n      initArrFromProps: this.arr,\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  created() {\r\n    console.log(\"I am render!\");\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h4>Props:</h4>\r\n      <div>Number: {{ num }}</div>\r\n      <div>String: {{ str }}</div>\r\n      <div>Object: {{ obj }}</div>\r\n      <div>Array: {{ arr }}</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h4>Data:</h4>\r\n      <div>Number: {{ initNumFromProps }}</div>\r\n      <div>String: {{ initStrFromProps }}</div>\r\n      <div>Object: {{ initObjFromProps }}</div>\r\n      <div>Array: {{ initArrFromProps }}</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the child component, when props updated, only `initObjFromProps` remain reactive, other data types are only updated once when the component is created\r\n\r\nyou can check [initial data from props](https://codesandbox.io/s/initial-data-from-props-e3mxid)\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nKeep all data initialized from props remain reactive if props updated\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOnly object type remain reactive\r\n\r\n---\r\ncurrent my solution is add a key props in child component to make it rerender(would be go through the created/mounted life cycle again)\r\n```vue\r\n<Child v-bind=\"props\" :key=\"props.str\"></Child>\r\n```\r\n\r\nif anyone has a better way, please let me know\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Open Codesandbox\r\n2. Click on \"Click me\"\r\n3. The browser opens `example.org`\r\n\r\nLocally:\r\n1. Create a blank Vue app with vue-router\r\n2. Add a link as follow: <router-link :to=\"url\">Click me</router-link>\r\n3. Specify a url with a line break such as :\r\n```js\r\n/\r\n/example.com\r\n```\r\n4. Click the link, your browser will open `/example.com`\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIt should trigger an error. Whether not a valid URL or not the same origin or redirect to `/`.\r\nOr it should redirects to `//example.com` (removing line breaks)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe browser opens `http://example.com`\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe bug was reported to us by a bug hunter. \r\n\r\nOne of our URL `https://dashboard.mailmeteor.com/login?redirect=%2F` was affected by the bug. If you share a URL to Mailmeteor having a line break in it, such as `https://dashboard.mailmeteor.com/login?redirect=%2F%0D%0A%2Fexample.com`, our application was redirecting to the distant domain. This has been fixed on our application by preventing redirection to URLs with multiple lines.\r\n\r\nWhile looking at the source of this issue, turns out that vue-router codebase defaults to `window.location.replace` in case the `history.replaceState` methods triggers an error. See here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/677f3c1f714fb61cc495345e535409b1cbb90429/src/util/push-state.js#L40\r\n\r\nAnd `window.location.replace(url)` has a \"bug\" that when you provide a url with a line break, it redirects to the last line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar url = `/\r\n/example.org`\r\nwindow.location.replace(url) // opens \"example.org\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

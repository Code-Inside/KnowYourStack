The Firefox element inspector reports all the elements as having the same height as each other (as they are all in cells in the same row this is expected) and as the cells that contain them.\r\n\r\nIn the mounted() function of the component I do this:\r\n\r\n        var el = this.$el;\r\n        this.context = el.getContext(\"2d\");\r\n        this.context.canvas.width = el.clientWidth;\r\n        this.context.canvas.height = el.clientHeight;\r\n\r\nI have also tried putting the above code in a Resize() function and doing the following in mounted():\r\n\r\n        setTimeout(this.Resize.bind(this), 1000);\r\n\r\nI have also tried using $nextTick().\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe canvas is resized to the element size. Drawing, which is based on the size of the canvas is correct. The drawn content displays crisply and perfectly.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nel.clientHeight is being reported incorrectly and the canvas is being stretched to fit the element's real size. The display is fuzzy and poor.\r\n\r\nAdding debug as follows:\r\n\r\n        console.log(\"ID=\"   el.id   \", w=\"   el.clientWidth   \", h=\"   el.clientHeight   \", pw=\"   el.parentElement.clientWidth   \", ph=\"   el.parentElement.clientHeight);\r\n\r\noutputs the following:\r\n\r\n    ID=port_swivel, w=74, h=291, pw=82, ph=291\r\n    ID=port_thrust, w=74, h=293, pw=82, ph=293\r\n    ID=ballast, w=74, h=295, pw=82, ph=295\r\n    ID=stbd_thrust, w=74, h=297, pw=82, ph=297\r\n    ID=stbd_swivel, w=74, h=299, pw=82, ph=299\r\n    ID=light_power, w=66, h=301, pw=74, ph=301\r\n\r\nFirefox reports the real element size as 300.55.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI found this article which is where I got the idea of using a timeout - as reported it didn't help.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/Discussion/issues/394\r\n\r\nIf I add similar debug to my Redraw() function, I can see that:\r\n\r\n1) The Redraw() is somehow being called before mounted(), and the element's width and height are correctly reported.\r\n\r\n2) When Redraw( is called by Resize() (when called directly by mounted()) the height is reported as being 2 pixels bigger in Redraw(0 than in Resize().\r\n\r\n 3) All subsequent calls to Redraw() get the height correct.\r\n\r\nSo whenever the execution path is NOT through mounted() the height is correct, but when the execution path is through mounted(), even when using setTimeout() or $nextTick(), the height is incorrect.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Then, inspect bottom select: the \"Input 0\" option should have the static attribute value=\"s0\" as defined in the Vue.js template, but instead has value=\"\".\r\n\r\n`<option v-if=\"!specSet['s0']\" value=\"s0\">Input 0</option>`\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI thought Vue.js should refresh the UI after changing top select from 0 to 1 so that the Input 0 option appears, with value=\"s0\".\r\n\r\n`<option value=\"s0\">Input 0</option>`\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue.js refreshes the UI and adds the Input 0 option, but its value attribute is set to empty string.\r\n\r\n`<option value=\"\">Input 0</option>`\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt may be related to #11398\r\n\r\nI have a parent component X with nested attribute X.Y.Z, and a child component that is given property referencing X.Y.Z.\r\n\r\nThe child component has a select input with options that appear depending on X.Y.Z.\r\n\r\nWhen X.Y is updated (after changing the top select in the minimal reproduction), the options in the select input are updated but their attributes are not updated correctly.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It emulates a case when the server side rendered component doesn't match the browser render result.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe \"I'm red\" text should be red indeed. Also it's wrapper should have the 'some-attr' attribute.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe \"I'm red\" text has the server side rendered class 'blue'. Also the 'some-attr' is absent.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAny update action turn the things right. E.g. if you click the \"I'm red\" text the adjacent 'span' is updated but the whole component wrapper also gets the correct attributes.\r\n\r\nAlso (and this is a workaround) it works fine if the SSR provides any other block type. E.g. \r\n```\r\n<span class=\"blue\"></span>\r\n```\r\n In this case the 'span' is properly replaced by the 'div' with suitable attributes.\r\n\r\nSorry for possible duplicate: tried to search the same case but no result. \r\n\r\nWe use Vue 2.6.6 on our production but the behavior is the same for 2.6.11 in the Jsfiddle. For some reason if I use the Jsfiddle Vue boilerplate template it works as expected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't provide the matching content form SSR: it's created by a 3rd-party library which doesn't support SSR yet.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Keep-alive only hits cache when user click back or forward button of browser and use a new page otherwise.\r\n\r\nbut I still think the key should be corresponding to the change of the routes. I think it represents the identifier of a URL or a page. when you replace a page with a new page, the key should be a new key too. \r\n\r\nand maybe router should use a new key too when using webpack hot reloads.\r\n\r\nlooks it's compatible if the replace methord use a new key since Router just use these keys to support the scroll-behavior feature, \r\n\r\nBy the way, I found some inconsistent behavior about the key in history when loading a page.\r\n\r\nsay the app is running at  http://localhost:8080/\r\n\r\n-  open a new tab and fill with  http://localhost:8080/ , the key is a number. reload the page then the key is the same number\r\n-  open a new tab and fill with  http://localhost:8080/#/ , the key is null.  reload the page then the key is null.\r\n\r\nall above are loading a page, but the keys are totally different. \r\n\r\nI think it's a good idea to provide a method to get the current key Router maintained  and it's also a good idea to provide a built-in mechanism to support bfcache in vue app\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Clone my repository, run `npm i && npm run serve`\r\n2. Click on the following links\r\n\r\n- Go to /users\r\n- Go to /users/1\r\n\r\n3. Go back to the previous page.

Even though I've added some comments there I'll try and explain what this code does. I added noop beforeEach hook there because I want to prevent a resolution of the initial route meaning I don't want to show dashboard or login page before the authentication check is resolved. Only after the user is authenticated (or not) I am calling `resolveRoute` function and redirecting the user to the correct page. This worked great with vue-router <= 3.2.0, but something has changed in the newer version and I can't figure out how to fix it in my code or if it has to be fixed inside a vue-router. Anyway, I would appreciate any help you could provide. Thanks\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Right now the use of [generic parameter defaults](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-3.html#generic-parameter-defaults) in helper.d.ts only requires Typescript 2.3._\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the typings of `Store`. Right now, given code like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet moduleC = {\r\n    state() {\r\n        return {\r\n            valueC: -13\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet moduleA = {\r\n    state() {\r\n        return ({\r\n            valueA: \"6\",\r\n        })\r\n    },\r\n    modules: {\r\n        c: moduleC,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet moduleB = {\r\n    state: {\r\n        a: 36,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n    state: () => ({\r\n        foo: 6\r\n    }),\r\n    modules: {\r\n        a: moduleA,\r\n        b: moduleB,\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould result in the type of `store.state` to only consider the local state in the root. Also `store.state` would be typed as a function and not as its return type. With this PR the type of `store.state` will correspond to\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    foo: number;\r\n    a: {\r\n        valueA: string;\r\n        c: {\r\n            valueC: number;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    b: {\r\n        a: number;\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nWe provided defaults for new generics, therefore one should be able to still use the types as before.\r\n\r\n### About older TS versions\r\nThere seems to be a strange bug in older versions of Typescript. Sometimes the type of a store differs depending on wheather you use the `{ state() { return {...}}, ... }` or the `{ state: () => ({...}), ... }` syntax. Its not that much of a problem though. We tested the typings in 2.8.4 and the only thing that happens was that the properties are missing, but TS does not throw an error (as long as you don't try to access one of these properties) In newer versions of Typescript everything is fine.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1797","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support modules and state functions in Store typings\" (#1797)"},{"Id":"653914558","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T09:43:48","Actor":"ohdnf","Number":"1795","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix link typo in Korean README","State":"closed","Body":"Remove duplicated parenthesis of link to \"Scrimba\" in Korean README markdown file.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1795","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: fix link typo in Korean README\" (#1795)"},{"Id":"653096417","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-08T08:25:15","Actor":"zaffsite","Number":"1794","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vuex data remains undefined when called in private/incognito mode","State":"closed","Body":"**Version**\r\n3.1.1\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nHard to explain and reproduce, only in incognito mode with Firefox 78.0.1, for a few reasons, it doesn't always happen.\r\n\r\n**What is expected?**\r\nData cannot be undefined because a default data has associated them, but remains undefined, or it is a setter problem.\r\n\r\n**What is actually happening?**\r\nSome data are and stay undefined.\r\n\r\nNo problem in normal navigation mode.\r\nHas anyone ever had this problem ?\r\n\r\nThanks","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1794","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Vuex data remains undefined when called in private/incognito mode\" (#1794)"},{"Id":"651089103","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T17:24:04","Actor":"samuelgozi","Number":"1793","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix code inconsistencies","State":"closed","Body":"I fixed some code inconsistencies in the English documentation.\r\nPlease let me know if ane changes are needed.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1793","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix code inconsistencies\" (#1793)"},{"Id":"650694251","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-04T03:17:41","Actor":"mattnathan","Number":"1792","RawContent":null,"Title":"Slow registerModule when the module has getters","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n3.5.1\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://jsfiddle.net/qaL8f36y/](https://jsfiddle.net/qaL8f36y/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n0.

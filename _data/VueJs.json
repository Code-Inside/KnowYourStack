Secondary buttons (like the middle or right button on a standard mouse) MUST NOT fire `click` events. See `auxclick` for a corresponding event that is associated with the non-primary buttons.\r\n\r\nSafari, however, does not care about what the specs say and fires the `click` event for secondary buttons, as evidenced by [this bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22382). Until version 68, Firefox would do the same, as noted in [this bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379466) and [the release notes for that version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/68#DOM_events).\r\n\r\nI found these two issues [[1](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5330), [2](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7020)] on the Vue repo that relate to it, but they're more about normalizing behavior so that `@click.middle` and `@click.right` behave more as one would expect them to, rather than normalizing behavior to account for browser quirks that cause `@click` to behave as one wouldn't expect it to.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I'm creating a web component that others will be able to embed in their own websites, therefore I have no control over whether there will be a global version of Vue loaded or not. I need to use the bundled one, because even if there is a global one, it may not be the correct version.\r\n\r\nMy initial idea would be to create a no-conflict.js and then change index.js to export everything from no-conflict and do the auto-registration.\r\n\r\nI can create a PR if you'd like but maybe there's a better way to do it?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

To do this, the `/` route is set to redirect with `location.href = '/'`, but that is being triggered immediately when a `router-link` references that route, even if the user doesn't click it.\r\n\r\nI have created a workaround by setting the route like this instead\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: \"/\",\r\n    beforeEnter() {\r\n      window.location.href = \"/\";\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When removing hundreds or thousands of links from the page, this cost is noticeable, especially on slow devices. The goal is a cost of `O(N)`.\r\n\r\nHundreds or thousands of links might seem too much, but sure there might be some cases where it makes sense, like an infinite scroll or some big grids. In many cases [vue-virtual-scroller][vue-virtual-scroller] should solve the general problem, but I think it would be better not to require it as a rule.\r\n\r\nRemoving the dependency on `$route` means effectively disabling reactivity for the RouterLink and thus all the related features. At this moment, I think the only affected features are the CSS classes to show a link is active.\r\n\r\n**Why this cost?**\r\n\r\nThe singleton `_route` is created for the `_routerRoot` [once][route-react]. At this moment, Vue instantiates a Dep to track writes and reads on this attribute.\r\n\r\nEach time a RouterLink is created, its render Watcher detects the `$route` [is accessed][route-render], so that the Watcher adds the Dep to its dependencies (`Watcher.deps`) and the Dep adds the Watcher to its subscribers (`Dep.subs`). This means the `Dep.subs` for `_route` is, at least, as large as the number of rendered RouterLinks.\r\n\r\nWhen the `$route` changes, all the RouterLink are [updated][notify] because they are on the `Dep.subs`.\r\n\r\nWhen destroying all the RouterLink (page change), all the components [teardown][teardown] their watchers, and each watcher have to remove itself from the `Dep.subs`. Removing a single RouterLink's Watcher from the `Dep.subs` costs O(N - i), where `N` is the number of RouterLink and `i` the number of RouterLink already removed.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the cost of removing N RouterLinks at once is O((N^2)/2).\r\n\r\n[watcher]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L4418\r\n[dep]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L701\r\n[notify]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L720\r\n[teardown]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L4601\r\n\r\n[route-react]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1299\r\n[route-getter]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1314\r\n[route-render]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1096\r\n\r\n[vue-virtual-scroller]: https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdding a `no-reactive` prop on RouterLink should be enough.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this prop is effectively disabling reactivity on the current route to improve the overall performance, especially when destroying many RouterLink at once.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, this flag turns off any feature that depends on the current route. At this moment, I think the only affected features are related to the CSS classes to show if a link is active or not.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However catching a promise means that the promise needs to be re-rejected so that the app code can carry on unaffected, and Vuex has been doing this by throwing the promise rejection reason. Since this is within a promise, doing so will fire any user-defined `catch()` callbacks (so the app code behaves the same as it would have without Vuex handling the rejection). However, it will also cause the browser's own devtools to pause when using the \"pause on exceptions\" feature, because from the browser's perspective this is an uncaught exception - the browser is not concerned about whether this is happening in a promise, or whether the promise rejection is subsequently handled safely. Since there's no real \"error\" here, this behaviour can be annoying during development when testing code that should be resilient to promise rejections.\r\n\r\nFortunately there's a way to maintain the same behaviour but without the browser seeing an uncaught exception: explicitly returning a rejected promise using `return Promise.reject(err);`. This safely re-rejects the promise so that the app code remains unaware & unconcerned that Vuex has handled the rejection, and the browser does not see an exception being thrown.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1970","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Return a rejected promise instead of throwing an error\" (#1970)"},{"Id":"858483134","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-15T04:59:46","Actor":"6twenty","Number":"1969","RawContent":null,"Title":"Return a rejected promise rather than use `throw` in actions when registering the devtools hook","State":"open","Body":"### Version\r\n3.6.2\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://x422e.csb.app/](https://x422e.csb.app/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nThis issue only occurs when using the Vue devtools extension (as far as I can tell) - however note that the issue is within Vuex and not the devtools extension. The issue occurs when `store._devtoolHook` is defined in the Vuex source.\r\n\r\n- Configure the browser's devtools debugger to break on exceptions (but not on caught exceptions) - e.g. in Firefox devtools go to the Debugger tab, expand the Breakpoints pane, and tick \"Pause on exceptions\"\r\n- Open the CodeSandbox demo with devtools open, and the Vue devtools extension installed\r\n- Observe that the devtools debugger will pause on a line of Vuex `throw err;`\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe devtools debugger should not pause, because no error was thrown in the app code. A promise was rejected, but it was also caught and handled properly, so there's no error.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThis error is being thrown as part of Vuex's function to register an action, where promise rejections are caught and emitted for the devtools hook, and then the promise rejection reason is thrown in order to re-reject the promise so that the app code is unaware that Vuex had handled the rejection at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, throwing an error also triggers the browser's \"pause on exceptions\" handler, even though this particular code is not technically \"erroring\".\r\n\r\nA safer way to handle re-rejecting the promise is to simply return a rejected promise instance using `return Promise.reject(err);`. Since this is being run inside of a `catch()` callback, returning a new promise will continue the promise chain, and being a rejected promise, it will then be handled by any user-defined `catch()` callbacks - essentially behaving exactly the same way as throwing the error, but without triggering the devtools debugger in the process.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI believe the same `throw` code is being used in Vuex 4.x however I haven't tested that build to confirm.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a developer experience improvement and is NOT a bug in production environments. I've confirmed this issue in Firefox Developer Edition.\r\n\r\nA real-world example: I have an app where I have used Vuex actions to load resources from an API and cache them in the Vuex store. These API requests are promise-based (fetch) and this promise is returned by the action in order for the calling code to await the request. In some situations the API request will fail and reject the promise *without throwing an error*, which is then caught and handled properly. However despite my code being resilient, my devtools debugger will always pause because Vuex is deliberately throwing an error.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

My answer to that would be it would make Vuex significantly more developer-friendly and make a significantly better developer experience. Which is the reason why Vue was created in the first place - to create a approachable/developer-friendly way to build user interfaces. A bunch of people agreed that the feature would be a good thing. Closed.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/is-it-possible-to-declare-a-watcher-inside-a-vuex-store/50375  \r\n@mikepatton75 asks if it's possible. The answer is no. Then a bunch of talk about his use-case which didn't need to happen if Vuex just had a watch option, right? Either way, there is no discussion as to WHY the feature isn't available in the Vuex API. So, that's a dead-end as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/vuex-can-i-use-watch-feature-inside-a-vuex-module/75633  \r\n@lwxbr says he does an \"extensive workaround\" to make a watcher in a store for his use-case, then opens an issue.  But, all he needed was a just simple watcher, right?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1624  \r\n@lwxbr opens the issue. Closed with reference back to #1219 that didn't have an answer.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/can-a-vuex-module-register-a-watcher-to-watch-its-local-state/8003  \r\n@jri asks if a store can watch its own state, but with an obscurely worded question about a circular file import that is pretty easy to fix with using a 3rd file. But, it never got answered, probably because the question was too obscure? But, perhaps the reason why it was obscure was probably because @jri just needed a simple watcher, but didn't have it, so it was hard to explain the problem in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nPlenty of people have already done this and have been ignored. So, that has proven to be unproductive. I'm simply asking a question \"why\" and am requesting an answer and/or productive discussion about it so that developers who have the same thought in the future have a productive place to look and understand why Vuex doesn't have a watch option.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to hear from a creator of Vuex with in-depth knowledge about Vuex/Vue as well as the philosophies behind them.\r\n\r\nPlease do not give just a random answer like, \"it's not necessary\" because, don't forget, Vue \"isn't necessary\" either. Let's all use Vanilla! \r\n\r\nI myself am a creator of a UI framework that I designed for beginner developers to learn JavaScript while also making UI frameworks easier to learn later on down the road. I've even taught Vue+Vuex to an entire development team at a company. So, I know how important the core philosophy of a library is.\r\n\r\nI have utmost respect for the developers of Vue and Vuex for making such incredible libraries, and I would hope to have that respect reciprocated with an actual productive discussion into this core feature.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

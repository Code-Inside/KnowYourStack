When using params and query, the behavior is still the same **and using named routes with params** is recommended for that reason:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// given a route /servers/:server\r\n// going to /servers/one%2Ftwo\r\n// should give\r\nthis.$route.params.server // one/two\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, this PR makes this possible, it wasn't working before.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, doing `router.push({ name: 'servers', params: { server: 'one/two' }})` will change the url to `/servers/one%2Ftwo` while giving the correct value in `$route.params.server`.\r\n\r\n## Why this can't be done automatically by the router\r\n\r\nWe could automatically call `encodeURI()` on each static segment of a path but this would also break code for users who are already correctly encoding `path` (you should always encode URLs, even before this change).\r\n\r\n## How to help the migration\r\n\r\nSince we were never supposed to pass an unencoded `path` to a route record or even call `router.push()` with an unencoded string or `path` property, I propose to warn in dev mode if any unencoded character is passed to help people be aware of how they should encode their routes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n### Internal explanation\r\n\r\nPreviously, this used to work because we were decoding paths twice, but this created other problems like **errors with URLs containing the character `%` encoded**. By fixing this bug we must remove the `decode` call made on the path when matching against existing routes, but this also makes it **impossible to automatically encode `path` anymore** because the user wouldn't be able to provide encoded characters, e.g. the `/` character (`%2F`) would be transformed to its encoded version, `%252F` (`%` is encoded as `%25`) and there wouldn't be a way to match an encoded slash character which is necessary in segments of the URL since the slash character is used to differentiate segments in a URL. Without this change, we can't correctly decode `%2F`\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this makes things consistent and it's also the same behavior that exists in v4\r\n\r\nClose #3337\r\nClose #3103\r\nClose #3125\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/pull/3350","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(encoding): decode params\" (#3350)"},{"Id":"724515739","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-19T11:15:21","Actor":"wxwzl","Number":"3349","RawContent":null,"Title":"vue-router.esm-bundler.js?6c02:1031 Uncaught Error: Route paths should start with a \"/\": \"**\" should be \"/**\".","State":"closed","Body":"vue-router  4.0.0-beta.13\r\n\r\n\r\nvue-router.esm-bundler.js?6c02:1031 Uncaught Error: Route paths should start with a \"/\": \"**\" should be \"/**\".\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3349","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"vue-router.esm-bundler.js?6c02:1031 Uncaught Error: Route paths should start with a \"/\": \"**\" should be \"/**\".\" (#3349)"},{"Id":"723839235","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-17T20:12:52","Actor":"tristansokol","Number":"3348","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs Add app engine to history mode docs","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\nHi!

It's caused by combining SSR, async route components, and redirects within navigation guards. I tried dodging async routes on the server and only using them on the client bundle (to still get the benefit of code-splitting), but that led to hydration errors. \r\n\r\nPossible workarounds are switching to static route components, avoiding redirects within navigation guards, or using the `router.push` api instead of `next`. In our own application we went for the third choice on the server, but had to add additional logic to prevent hydration errors and handle the history mode correctly.\r\n\r\nEither way it might make sense to go over the [official SSR guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/routing.html#routing-with-vue-router) to better communicate this issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This would be useful for example when the action initiates a promise that contains an setInterval which needs to be cleared when the user performs some action. Leaving the promise to continue polling would be unnecessarily expensive.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, below follows an example. I want the action to return my custom `CancellablePromise` in which I have extended the promise executor with an `onCancel` delegate which is called when `promise.cancel` is called.\r\n\r\n**Action**\r\n```ts\r\nasync [SomeAction.foo]({ state, dispatch, commit, rootGetters }) {\r\n  const cancellablePromise = new CancellablePromise<any>((resolve, reject, onCancel) => {\r\n    const interval = setInterval(async () => {\r\n      const status = await dispatch(SomeAction.bar);\r\n      if (status === \"goodstatus\") {\r\n        clearInterval(interval);\r\n        resolve();\r\n      } else if (status === \"badstatus\") {\r\n        clearInterval(interval);\r\n        reject();\r\n      } else if (status === \"pending\") {\r\n        ; // continue polling\r\n      }\r\n    }, 2000);\r\n\r\n    onCancel(() => {\r\n      clearInterval(interval);\r\n      reject();\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return cancellablePromise;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Component**\r\n```ts\r\ndata: (() => {\r\n  promise: undefined as CancellablePromise<any> | undefined\r\n}),\r\n\r\nasync call() {\r\n  this.promise = this.$store\r\n    .dispatch(SomeAction.foo)\r\n    .then(response => {\r\n      // do something\r\n    }) as CancellablePromise<any>;\r\n},\r\n\r\nuserTookAction(event): void {\r\n  if (this.promise) {\r\n    this.promise.cancel(); // outputs cancel is not a function\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs specified, `this.promise.cancel()` outputs that cancel is not a function, because my `CancellablePromise` is wrapped by `dispatch`.\r\n\r\nTo work around this problem I have been forced to create my own \"actions\" in a separate module which I call directly instead of through `dispatch`, and to which I pass the `ActionContext` in order to use the rest of Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI am not familiar with the internal workings of Vuex, but I would simply want the above example to work. Ideally `this.$store.dispatch(action)` would return the same type as returned by the action itself.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Each customer have a custom main application with different sub-applications/modules in package.json. Each sub-application have their own namespaced Vuex store. We want to have a default implementation of some actions in the sub-applications, then be able to override the default action in the main application.\r\n\r\nOur current workaround/hack is to try them both:\r\n\r\n`this.$store.dispatch('actionName', payload, { root: true }) || this.$store.dispatch('moduleName/actionName', payload)`\r\n\r\nThat way Vuex will look for the action in root module first, and if not found there it will look in the namespaced module and use that (default) action. It works but in dev mode we get a console error  about module not found if we don't have an action in root.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIt would be nice to have an option that tells Vuex to look in root module first (without namespace) and then in local module if the action is not found in root module. I can't come up with a good name for the option. When the option is true Vuex should remove the module name and try to find the actionName in root module. If not found there it should do as normal use the full actionName as specified.\r\n\r\n`this.$store.dispatch('moduleName/actionName', payload, { namespaced: false  }`\r\n\r\nAnother way would be to allow for an array of actions and Vuex would try each action in order.\r\n\r\n`this.$store.dispatch(['actionName', 'moduleName/actionName'], payload, { root: true  }`\r\n\r\nThat would actually be a more flexible solution because I could specify as many action names as I want.\r\n\r\n`this.$store.dispatch(['tryThisFirst', 'moduleA/thenThis', 'moduleB/andFinallyThis'], payload, { root: true  }`\r\n\r\nOr is there another way to solve this problem? We want a default implementation in imported module, but possible to override action in the main application.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Fix for Example 1:\r\n```\r\nfunction getUser(store: Store): Promise<any> {\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n        const user = store.state.user;\r\n        if (user || user === null) {\r\n            resolve(user);\r\n        } else {\r\n            const unwatch = store.watch(\r\n                (state: any) => {\r\n                    return state.user;\r\n                },\r\n                (value: any) => {\r\n                    if (value || value === null) {\r\n                        unwatch();\r\n                        resolve(value)\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Workaround wrapper\r\nThis is a more general purpose wrapper as a workaround (not fully tested)\r\n```\r\nfunction wrapper(store: Store<any>, getter: (state?: any, getters?: any) => any,\r\n                  callback: (newValue?: any, oldValue?: any, unwatch?: () => void) => void, options?: any): () => void {\r\n    // callback receives a unwatch function as third parameter\r\n    if (options.immediate) {\r\n        let shouldStop = false;\r\n        const current = getter(store.state, store.getters);\r\n        callback(current, undefined, () => {\r\n            shouldStop = true;\r\n        });\r\n        if (shouldStop) {\r\n            return () => {};\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    const unwatch = store.watch(\r\n        getter,\r\n        (newValue: any, oldValue: any) => {\r\n            callback(newValue, oldValue, unwatch);\r\n        },\r\n        Object.assign({}, options, {immediate: false}));\r\n    return unwatch;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Duplicated namespace in components\r\n\r\nlike this:\r\n_my-component.vue_ (AS-IS version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...mapState(\"todos\", {\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...mapGetters(\"todos\", {\r\n      doneItems: \"doneItems\",\r\n      activeItems: \"activeItems\",\r\n    }),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, `\"doneItmes\"` is written by string. It will cause bug easily.\r\nAnd there are duplicated namespace called `\"todos\"`. It will inhibit maintainabillity.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe way to introduce it is not to suggest a new API, but to use the existing API properly.\r\nWe can use `createNamespacedHelpers` API with constants in store directory!\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/types.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const NAMESPACE = \"todos\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/index.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createNamespacedHelpers } from\"vuex\";\r\nimport { NAMESPACE } from \"./types\";\r\n\r\n// Key point !\r\nconst { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions } = createNamespacedHelpers(NAMESPACE);\r\n\r\nexport { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions };\r\n\r\nexport default { /* namespaced, state, getters, mutations, actions */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/getters.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Key point !\r\nexport const DONE_ITEMS = \"DONE_ITEMS\";\r\nexport const ACTIVE_ITEMS = \"ACTIVE_ITEMS\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  [DONE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => todo.isDone),\r\n  [ACTIVE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => !todo.isDone)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we can use customized binding helpers.\r\n\r\n_my-component.vue_ (TO-BE version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as todos from '@/store/todos'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as getters from '@/store/todos/getters'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as actions from '@/store/todos/types'; // Key point !\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...todos.mapState({\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...todos.mapGetters([\r\n      getters.DONE_ITEMS,\r\n      getters.ACTIVE_ITEMS,\r\n    ])\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...todos.mapActions([\r\n      actions.ADD_ITEM,\r\n    ]),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow about this? If you do not mind this, I would like to post it on the official Vuex document.\r\nYou can see the all example code in [this repository](https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/vuex-best-practice-lab)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Actually, I want to use data in array name is 'mdbListSelected' that was collected data from user selected on other component and want to know how much user selected its every time as well. I try to use Vuex like below but it doesn't work, Eventhough, I try to use ...mapAction to define in v-model of Treeselect but it doesn't work too. Anyone know how to correct it please explain me, Thank a lot.\r\n\r\n*** I have tried to use simple vuex by get message from it via getter name getMessage and it work normally. ***\r\n\r\n==================================================\r\n**## listcomponent.vue ##**\r\n<template>\r\n<treeselect \r\n      :normalizer=\"normalizer\" \r\n      :multiple=\"true\" \r\n      :options=\"mdbsList\" \r\n      :disable-branch-nodes=\"true\"\r\n      :value-consists-of=\"BRANCH_PRIORITY\"\r\n      :default-expand-level=\"1\"\r\n      :alwaysOpen=\"true\"\r\n      :max-height=\"460\"\r\n      search-nested\r\n      v-model=\"dataSelected\"   // Contains data that selected \r\n    />\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n^<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n   data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      mdbsList: [ ], \r\n      mdbListSelected: [ ],   // The data that was collected when user selected\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n      ...mapActions(['mdbSelected'])\r\n  }\r\n\r\n=======================================================\r\n**## store.js ##**\r\nconst state = {\r\n  message: 'Hello from VueX',\r\n  selected: [ ]\r\n}\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  MDBFILTERSELECTED(state, payload) {\r\n    state.selected = payload\r\n    console.log(selected)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nconst actions = {\r\n  mdbSelected(context, param) {\r\n    context.commit('MDBFILTERSELECTED', param)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst getters = {\r\n  getMessage: state => state.message,\r\n  getMDBSelected: state => state.selected\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  state,\r\n  getters,\r\n  mutations,\r\n  actions\r\n}","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1435","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How can I push value with array into ...mapAction \" (#1435)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2018-12-04T05:31:10.8754609Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":5297}

However, I am unable to find mutations nor actions.\r\n\r\nI first tried to set namespace to false, the mutations and actions were not registered as global mutations and actions. (There are no such mutations or actions at all)\r\n\r\nI then tried to set namespace to true, the mutations and actions were not registered as namespaced mutations and actions neither. (```this.$store.commit('moduleName/mutationName')``` doesn't work; an error message pops up: ```[vuex] unknown action type: categories/getAllCategories```)\r\n\r\nI tried to debug by printing out the 'categories' module object and the store object and I found that:\r\n\r\n 1. Modules themselves are correctly defined. Mutations and Actions are correctly defined in the module object.\r\n 2. Module states are correctly registered in store.state (as per previously tested)\r\n 3. Module mutations and actions are not correctly registered in ```store._mutations``` and ```store._actions``` (no matter the modules are namespaced or not, the mutations and actions don't appear as global or namespaced properties); ```store._mutations``` and ```store._actions``` show as empty objects. \r\n 4. Modules can be seen in ```store._modules.root._children``` and ```store._modules.root._rawModule```\r\n\r\nThe result of console.log(categories) and console.log(this.$store) are shown: \r\n[![console.log(categories)][1]][1]\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n[![console.log(this.$store)][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone help me to solve the issue?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Steps to reproduce\r\n- In a nodejs app open app.js with VSCode and type \"import create\"\r\n- Select \"createStore / node_modules/vuex/types/index\" and press enter\r\n- Results in \"import { createStore } from 'node_modules/vuex/types/index';\"\r\n- Execute \"npm run watch\"\r\n- Fails with \"Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'node_modules/vuex/types/index' in '/var/www/vhosts/yourwebsite/httpdocs/resources/js'\"\r\n- Change \"import { createStore } from 'node_modules/vuex/types/index';\" to \"import { createStore } from 'vuex';\"\r\n- \"npm run watch\" now works BUT autocompletion for the \"store\" is no longer available\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n\"npm run watch\" should work simultaneous with autocompletion\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n\"npm run watch\" works or autocompletion works, not both\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

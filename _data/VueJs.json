ref's","State":"open","Body":"### Version\r\n2.7.14\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/unruffled-ramanujan-w51m8g?file=/src/index.ts)\r\n\r\n(this is a typescript bug, it's not visible on the sfc playground)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Use shallowRef with a generic type params that's a union : `shallowRef<{a:1} | {b:2}>({a:1})`\r\n- Or use shallowRef and specify argument's type with `as`: `shallowRef({a:1} as {a:1} | {b:2})`\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe return type should be `ShallowRef<{a:1} | {b:2}>`.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe return type is `ShallowRef<{a:1}> | ShallowRef<{b:2}>`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis breaks Vue's watch function. The first argument of watch's callback becomes a Ref instead of the value, which will cause a runtime error because `Property 'value' does not exist on type '{ a: 1; } | { b: 2; }'`\r\n\r\nThe reproduction link provides a good example of this. If you have any questions just ask me.\r\n\r\nI've fixed the issue on my fork and the CI actions completed successfully. \r\n\r\nYou need to change\r\n`function shallowRef<T extends object>(value: T): T extends Ref ? T : ShallowRef<T>;`\r\n\r\nto \r\n`function shallowRef<T extends object>(value: T): [T] extends [Ref] ? T : ShallowRef<T>;`\r\n\r\nThis matches ref's type:\r\n`function ref<T extends object>(value: T): [T] extends [Ref] ? T : Ref<UnwrapRef<T>>;`\r\n\r\nThis issue is the same issue as vuejs/core#7852\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When removing hundreds or thousands of links from the page, this cost is noticeable, especially on slow devices. The goal is a cost of O(N).\r\n\r\nHundreds or thousands of links might seem too much, but sure there might be some cases where it makes sense, like an infinite scroll or some big grids. In many cases [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller) should solve the general problem, but I think it would be better not to require it as a rule.\r\n\r\nRemoving the dependency on $route means effectively disabling reactivity for the RouterLink and thus all the related features. At this moment, I think the only affected features are the CSS classes to show a link is active.\r\n\r\n### Why this cost?\r\n\r\nThe singleton _route is created for the _routerRoot [once](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1299). At this moment, Vue instantiates a Dep to track writes and reads on this attribute.\r\n\r\nEach time a RouterLink is created, its render Watcher detects the $route [is accessed](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.5.1/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L1096), so that the Watcher adds the Dep to its dependencies (Watcher.deps) and the Dep adds the Watcher to its subscribers (Dep.subs). This means the Dep.subs for _route is, at least, as large as the number of rendered RouterLinks.\r\n\r\nWhen the $route changes, all the RouterLink are [updated](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L720) because they are on the Dep.subs.\r\n\r\nWhen destroying all the RouterLink (page change), all the components [teardown](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.6.12/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js#L4601) their watchers, and each watcher have to remove itself from the Dep.subs. Removing a single RouterLink's Watcher from the Dep.subs costs O(N - i), where N is the number of RouterLink and i the number of RouterLink already removed.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the cost of removing N RouterLinks at once is O((N^2)/2).\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdding a no-reactive prop on RouterLink should be enough.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this prop is effectively disabling reactivity on the current route to improve the overall performance, especially when destroying many RouterLink at once.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, this flag turns off any feature that depends on the current route. At this moment, I think the only affected features are related to the CSS classes to show if a link is active or not.\r\n\r\n**ORIGINAL LINK: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3500#issue-839908459**","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3808","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Ability to disable reactivity to improve performance on destroy - On 2.6.* \" (#3808)"},{"Id":"1454709778","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-18T10:00:30","Actor":"daniil4udo","Number":"3807","RawContent":null,"Title":"next(false) clears path on global Navigation Guards","State":"closed","Body":"@posva, sorry my bad in the example, but I found the reason behind my \"path flashes\", it's `ensureURL` method in the `HTML5History` class.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// next(false) -> abort navigation, ensure current URL\r\nthis.ensureURL(true)\r\n```\r\nIf we take a look at this method\r\n\r\n```\r\nensureURL (push?: boolean) {\r\n  if (getLocation(this.base) !== this.current.fullPath) {\r\n    const current = cleanPath(this.base + this.current.fullPath)\r\n    push ? pushState(current) : replaceState(current)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nif I try to go straight to the restricted path, at some point, in my app I have `next(false)`, that causes half-second absolutely clear URL.\r\n\r\nWhen I logged vars in this method I noticed that it pushes to `to` url WITH aborting navigation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"312\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34333374/201911818-b123d461-58d2-452d-a1a9-70094fc1576c.png\">\r\n\r\nWhen I commented that `ensureURL(true)` app worked as expected without annoying flashes.\r\n\r\nCould you plz explain why do we need it?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3807","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"next(false) clears path on global Navigation Guards\" (#3807)"},{"Id":"1449946401","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-18T07:35:36","Actor":"tachib-shin","Number":"3806","RawContent":null,"Title":"[feature or defect]: no `\\(` when opening a new group in group path","State":"closed","Body":"It sounds a little confusing, so I'm going to interpret it with a valid and invalid path:\r\n| type | path |\r\n| --- | ----- |\r\n| Valid: | `/phim/:season/:chapName(?:(.+\\)-)?:chap(\\d+)?` |\r\n| Notvalid: | `/phim/:season/:chapName(?:\\(.+\\)-)?:chap(\\d+)?` |\r\n\r\nas soon as I add `\\` first `(` to mark this as a group, vue-router error message cannot identify the group\r\n\r\nDemo: https://paths.esm.dev/?p=AAMeJRyAwQIWLALcM-BMgWII2IPZDhsDpEHIARpvUADEDwGVDdAOQJSA0QJRt1IlE8DcJkEBAAA.&t=/phim/sfweferg/tap-432#\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is a feature or a bug, but if it's a feature, please add it as noted in the document.

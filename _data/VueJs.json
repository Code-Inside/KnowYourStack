This way *It will split out the initialization code of a larger chunk to avoid any additional round trips and improve performance in general*. (Read more in: [the issue in module-federation](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples/issues/375#issuecomment-707442224), [webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/#troubleshooting) and [a blog post](https://dev.to/waldronmatt/tutorial-a-guide-to-module-federation-for-enterprise-n5#host)).\r\n\r\nWhen we try this concept in Vue 2 (latest version, 2.6.14), during SSR, vue-server-renderer will complain as it expects the module export to be a function, regardless of whether it will run it in a new context or not (`runInNewContext`).\r\n\r\nSee below commit (over the vue-hackernews example project) where the issue is minimally reproduced: The server entry will simply export the function creating the app instance through an import, instead of exporting it directly: https://github.com/tameraydin/vue-hackernews-2.0/commit/074192d9da26f8d78c742acb4328468edb19806c\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThere would be no need to introduce any new API or a breaking change. We would like vue-server-renderer to support also such async initializations; in other words, to accept also `Promise` (e.g. `import`) type of exports which would then resolve to a function that it currently expects, so that the Module Federation & SSR can be fully achieved in Vue 2.\r\n\r\nWe have solved this in our local fork (through a small refactoring over [createBundleRunner](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/server/bundle-renderer/create-bundle-runner.js#L91)) with proper testing and are happy to open a pull-request - but of course, we would like get your feedback first.\r\n\r\n_**PS**.

Anyone that watches a tutorial on databinding with vuex will surely have puked and ran away.

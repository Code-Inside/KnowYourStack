Create an element with `type` attribute set to either `checkbox` or `radio`.\r\n2. Call `preventDefault` on the `click` event (or just set `@click.prevent`)\r\n3. Set the `checked` value synchronously to a different value\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNew value that is set should be reflected in the rendered markup.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe result of the value changing is not reflected in the in the rendered state even though the value is actually changed based on what is shown in Vue dev tools.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis worked prior to `2.6.0` and I can not find any documentation indicating the behavior changed or why it would change.  In the reproduction link you can comment out the `2.6.0` version and uncomment the line above it with `2.5.22`.  On `2.5.22` it works as expected.\r\n\r\nI have been using this previously when wrapping an input with a styled alternative with additional markup/styling.  The purpose of having `preventDefault` is to allow the decision of the value change to be made in a location other than the checkbox itself.  For example, we could easily display a dialog box when the user clicks this and then when it is closed set the state based on the response.  Removing `preventDefault` causes the checkbox to toggle.  If this happens but we want to wait until a later time to set the state, the desired state is not reflected properly until that time.  Some cases, no async work is done and it is desirable to change state immediately.  In those cases, a simple `v-model` can be used with the same exact component.\r\n\r\nA dialog box is just one example, I also have cases where there is an network call before the actual state is changed.  (one style is a toggle slider for example but i have other styled inputs as well)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I have created an application with a large number of components and modules and therefore a large number of namespaced getters. Every time such a getter is invoked the makeLocalGetters function is called iterating trough all the getters in the store just to create the gettersProxy object. This is overkill for ssr performance and is being flagged as a CPU consuming process in the node profiler. \r\nI have managed to double the number of requests per second my ssr app can handle just by using memoization on the gettersProxy object creation. I think this is really impacting performance.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNamespaced getters invokation not to be inefficient with large numbers of getters/modules\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nA lot of hits to makeLocalGetters making performance go down\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Plugins _alter_ an existing store / module, modules provide some completed state based functionality. \r\n\r\nTherefore it can often be the case where a reusable and freely distributed module is desirable (e.g. to include in multiple projects or multiple component libraries). \r\n\r\nAt the moment Vuex's documentation strikes a surprising balance of brevity and coverage (although in my opinion plugins could use some more expansion). However, the mention of how to make and distribute vuex modules is completely absent. \r\n\r\nSince Vue and the Vue ecosystem has lowered the barrier to entry to web development, not using Vue has complete coverage of the nuances of JavaScript and the many core libraries that help it work on the web (e.g. Babel)\r\n\r\nThus it would be relevant and beneficial to provide a complete example (even if it is minimal) of how to make a truly reusable module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would consider something simplistic (e.g. the counter app). However, I would suggest 2  modifications:\r\n\r\n1. an async / await version (as this can cause trouble with bundling)\r\n2. a typescript variant\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// reusable module\r\n\r\nconst state = () => ({\r\n  count: 0,\r\n  delay: 500\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst getters = {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst actions = {\r\n  async updateCount({state, commit}, byHowMuch) {\r\n    let newCount = await setTimeout( () => state.count   byHowMuch, state.delay)\r\n    commit('setCount', newCount)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  setCount(state, amount) {\r\n    state.count = amount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport {namespaced:true, state, mutations, actions, getters}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide the configuration file for how to use rollup and deploy to npm / yarn \r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide how to incorporate with nuxt\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// <nuxt-project>/store/AsyncCountModule/index.js\r\nimport AsyncCountModule from 'AsyncCountModule'\r\n\r\nexport AsyncCountModule //<-- this doesnt work \r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

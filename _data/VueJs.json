All components make use of life-cycle hooks e.g. to [provide] attributes to deeply nested slot components.\r\n\r\nCreate two template strings with wrapper (e.g. div id=xy), inside two or three vue-components from same vue file. In the second template, remove the first component. At runtime, use Vue.compile to reder content, switch the templates and e.g. log attributes in life-cycle hooks.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe log has to show the attributes from first component (which one has been removed).\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe log shows the attributes from last component of all siblings. \r\nWatchers on attributes, trigger and show the old value (attr from last sibling) and new value (current and correct attribute from related component).\r\n\r\n---\r\nTried many things, but nothing works.

It can do so much on the frontend. And it is a sufficient tool especially when paired with PHP or Node.Js.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm offended that creators of JavaScript frameworks are now making Frontend Development too difficult.\r\n\r\nMy particular anger goes to Vue.JS.\r\n\r\nIf I've taken the pain to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then I'm going forward to learn Vue on top of JavaScript, why didn't Vue ensure that this should be enough?\r\n\r\nWhy do I still need to learn **Nuxt** for Server Side Rendering, **Pinia** for Storage, **Vuetify** for Components, and **Vitest** for testing?\r\n\r\nWith so much frontend power in JavaScript already, can't Vue just come with these additional features in-built?\r\n\r\nAnd if they are not in-built, can't Vue integrate them into the Vue core in a next update to the Vue Framework?\r\n\r\nYou see, it's frustrating learning too much and learning some new tools because of some ordinary small additional features--- small features that can simply be built into Vue core.\r\n\r\nAll of these over-learning is making frontend Development too difficult.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm hoping for Vue to become a fully featured batteries included framework like Python.\r\n\r\nThis fully featured batteries included framework concept for Vue means that, after the pain of learning JavaScript and we then add Vue on top of it,we should need nothing more.\r\n\r\nI make websites with WordPress, and all the headaches that coding from scratch presents, are all taken away--while using WordPress.\r\n\r\nWith WordPress, a Database is already there. A Content creation Interface is already there. Admin Dashboard for managing **Themes**(Looks) and **Plugins**(Functionality) is already there.  Everything you need is all there, and it's simply drag and drop to build your website.\r\n\r\nThe WordPress process is so easy, and it keeps evolving to make life and website development so easy.\r\n\r\nIn essence, I am asking that Vue should make our life easier by being a fully featured Framework with a **Batteries-Included** approach--- where if we add Vue on Top of JavaScript, we should need nothing more and nothing extra. \r\n\r\nAll the features that will make us need Nuxt, Vuetify, Pinia and Vitest, should all come as core in-built features of Vue.\r\n\r\nRegards.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/13016","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Vue.Js should be a fully featured framework.\"

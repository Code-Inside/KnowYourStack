This pattern promotes code reuse, component composition, and DRYness.\r\n\r\nWhile Vue has this ability, it [feels hacky](https://codewithhugo.com/writing-multiple-vue-components-in-a-single-file/) and sacrifices much of the clarity and usability that .vue files provide.\r\n\r\nThis aim of this proposal is to define a clear and intuitive API for defining multiple components in a single .vue file.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n#### `<component>`\r\nThe `<component>` element is the building block of multi-component .vue files. Used as a top-level tag in .vue files, it's effectively a self-contained \"single-file component\", and it can contain anything that is valid in single-file components as they're currently defined. A .vue file can contain any number of `<component>` elements. They are evaluated from top to bottom—no hoisting. The element accepts two properties that control its availability to other parts of the code:\r\n\r\n- `name` (string, no default)\r\n\r\n  The name of the variable that the component is assigned to. Components defined lower in the file can reference this component by its name. Additionally, if the component is exported (see below), this is the name under which it will be exported.\r\n\r\n- `export` (boolean, default `false`)\r\n\r\n  Whether or not the component is exported. If a component is exported, but doesn't have a `name`, it will be the default export. More than one exported component without a name would create multiple default exports, and is therefore an error. All components must have either `name` or `export` or both.\r\n\r\nBy using the `<component>` element, individual .vue files gain a great deal more flexibility and power. They can compose a single exported component from many small child components, they can export many small components used throughout an application, they can export a main default component and less frequently used named components, and so on.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\n##### An isolated component (`Foo`) only used by another component in the same file:\r\n```vue\r\n<component name=\"Foo\">...</component>\r\n<component export>\r\n    <script>export default { components: { Foo } };</script>\r\n    <template><foo /></template>\r\n</component>\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Named and default exports:\r\n```vue\r\n<component export name=\"Foo\">...</component>\r\n<component export name=\"Bar\">...</component>\r\n<component export>...</component>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese would be imported in another file with `import Baz, { Foo, Bar } from './Baz.vue';`\r\n\r\n##### An illegal file due to multiple default exports\r\n```vue\r\n<component export>...</component>\r\n<component export>...</component>\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### An illegal file, because it combines the multi-component format and the single-component format\r\n```vue\r\n<component name=\"Foo\">...</component>\r\n<script>export default { components: { Foo } };</script>\r\n<template><foo /></template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nThe addition of the `<component>` element would not be a breaking change—single-file components with no top-level `<component>` tags would continue to function exactly as they do today. As mentioned in the example above, combining the single-component format with the multi-component format is an error.\r\n\r\nA potential point of conflict is the existing `<component>` tag than can be used in templates. I don't foresee this being a problem, since the usage of `<component>` as a top-level tag in .vue files is well defined, but I can't say for sure.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The way vue-lazy-hydration works is, that it behaves differently on the server than it does on the client. On the server the script (of an async component) is loaded immediately so the template renderer correctly detects that it is used. But on the client the script might not be needed at all but because the template renderer has already injected it it is immediately loaded on page load.\r\n\r\nThere is currently kind of a backlash against loading huge amounts of JavaScript. vue-lazy-hydration can help with removing a lot of unnecessary JavaScript on server side rendered, mostly static sites like blogs and documentation. But currently it can't completely prevent loading all of the unnecessary JavaScript because of the way how template renderer works.\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant line in the code: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/server/template-renderer/index.js#L226\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI propose to make this configurable:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst renderer = createBundleRenderer(serverBundle, {\r\n  template,\r\n  renderUsedAsyncScripts: false,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This option would make watch callback function fire only if any of the first level values in an Array (a tuple) or on Object change. This would offer an alternative to the current behaviour of always calling the watch callback when watching a non-primitive variable (as per [the following comment](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/4f111f9225f938f7a2456d341626dbdfd210ff0c/src/core/observer/watcher.js#L184)). It would also be a natural expansion of the `deep: boolean;` option.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the first level properties of the watched Arrays and Objects would _always_ be compared used strict equality comparison `===`, regardless of whether they are primitive values or Arrays/Objects. This is so that the same instances of a class would not trigger the watch callback, as nothing has changed (the use case is: observing an immutable value object).\r\n\r\nUse case 1: Watching a tuple, aka. watching many variables and having a single callback when any of the variables change. With the `shallow: true` option, it would be a very clean solution to current necessity of having to hash the tuple somehow (the easiest way is to `.join(',')` the tuple to produce a string, but not all tuples are made of primitive values, so that's not always this easy). Two tuples should evaluate equal, when all indexes of the old tuple are set to the same values in the new tuple, under the same indexes. It'd be a simple for-each loop that short-circuits on the first inequality in the old and the new tuple.\r\n\r\nUse case 2: Watching all keys in an Object. This is a very common use case and using `deep: true` for it is very often not ideal (especially, if the values in the watched Object are also Objects). As in use case 1, here the old and the new Objects would evaluate unequal (and therefore trigger the watch callback), when any of the keys in the old Object doesn't strict-equal the same key in the new Object. Also, if keys are missing or there are extra keys in the new Object, this should also be treated as a change and therefore trigger the watch callback. A common context for this use case is when the watched Object is a hashmap behaving as a \"form\", whose keys are form keys and values are either primitive variables or value objects. Watching such a hashmap with the proposed `shallow: true` option would be _a massive_ convenience (e.g. to run validation on every change in the form and enable/disable the submit button).\r\n\r\nIn angular 1, this feature is called [$watchCollection](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$watchCollection).\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```javascript\r\nclass Person {\r\n  constructor(name) {\r\n    this.name = name;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst vm = new Vue({\r\n  data: {\r\n    dataHashmap: {\r\n      bartender: new Person('Phil'),\r\n      bouncer: new Person('Rob'),\r\n      janitor: new Person('Tom'),\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nvm.$watch(\r\n  'dataHashmap', \r\n  () => { console.log(vm.dataHashmap); }, \r\n  { shallow: true }\r\n);\r\n\r\nvm.$watch(\r\n  (vm) => { return [vm.dataHashmap.bartender, vm.dataHashmap.janitor]; }, \r\n  () => { console.log(vm.dataHashmap); }, \r\n  { shallow: true }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Some of my routes must have an 'Organization' selected. If a user attempts to hit the route without having an organization selected, they are redirected to another route to set up an organization. All of my routes require that a user is authenticated, or else they are redirected to my auth server.\r\n\r\nI understand that it is possible to nest each of my guards in one single guard; however, I have unique combinations of guards per route (not all routes have the same guards), which makes it difficult to express the requirements of a route without writing a guard to contain each guard the route requires (versus something easier and more expressive, such as an array).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is clearly a responsibility of the framework to support this. I have heard the arguments that you can write one guard that contains each guard inside of it, but is that really a solution when we have multiple people asking for this feature?

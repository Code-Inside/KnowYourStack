'foo' : 'bar'\"\r\n    :show-icon=\"true\"\r\n    color=\"blue\"\r\n    label=\"Foo\"\r\n    icon-src=\"smile.svg\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor an individual component in a layout with literal or simple attribute values, this is fine -- it's clear in intent, the unused props have suitable defaults (or warn if required), etc. However, when such a component is used in a `v-for` loop, it can often turn into a bunch of yak-shaving, where the developer is basically destructuring the iterated item by hand into individual attribute bindings:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n<my-comp v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\"\r\n    mode=\"item.mode\"\r\n    :size=\"item.size\"\r\n    :show-icon=\"item.showIcon\"\r\n    :color=\"blue\"\r\n    :label=\"item.label\"\r\n    :icon-src=\"item.iconSrc\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is tiresome, error-prone (forgetting the colon for interpreted values, swapped values, bad Pascal-to-kebab conversions, etc.), and verbose. (I made two errors above, by the way... :))\r\n\r\nThe current alternative is for developers to use a parameter of type Object as a \"catch-all\" for properties so they can easily create and maintain their component instances.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, I propose that a special \"magic\" attribute be designated (maybe \"props\"?). When this attribute is bound to an object, Vue will unpack the properties of the object and assign them to their respective (same-named) props.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWith this proposed special attribute, these two examples would be equivalent to the ones above:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n<my-comp :props=\"{\r\n    mode: active ? 'foo' : 'bar',\r\n    size: 3,\r\n    showIcon: true,\r\n    color: 'blue',\r\n    label: 'Foo',\r\n    iconSrc: 'smile.svg' }\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<my-comp v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\" :props=\"item\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, while using this form for literal attribute values on an individual component would be silly, it's a vast improvement where the desired attributes of the component already match an available object. Using the ES6 spread operator, it would even be easy to \"tweak\" the object to add a few more attributes. For example, these would be equivalent:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n<my-comp\r\n    v-for=\"item in items\"\r\n    :key=\"item.id\"\r\n    :props=\"item\"\r\n    :is-active=\"item.id === currentItem\" />\r\n\r\n<my-comp\r\n    v-for=\"item in items\"\r\n    :key=\"item.id\"\r\n    :props=\"{...item, isActive: item.id === currentItem}\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you *want* to use this form but your incoming state object doesn't match the component's interface, no problem, just use a computed value to map from the state to the component's properties. The beauty there is, if you have similar situations in other places in your application, you can make it a mix-in, encapsulating the logic. And if the component interface, the backing data, or the mapping between them needs to change, you only need to adjust one place in the code, not the markup on every page where you used the component.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. Where there is a collision of an explicitly-defined attribute and a key on the `props` value, I propose the attribute should override the object. Any keys of the `props` value not matching an attribute name would be ignored.\r\n\r\n2. This would require *no changes* to the components themselves... they would be unaware of the `props` attribute, they would only see their incoming properties.\r\n\r\n3. Since I don't use JSX, I don't know if this option would be useful, terrible, or neutral for those developers.\r\n\r\n4. There is precedent for \"magic\" (non-directive) attributes -- key, various slot-related attributes, etc. If there is serious concern about collisions of `props` with actual components in the wild using a prop called \"props,\" I can imagine two solutions: (1) bypass this functionality when a component has a prop named \"props\", or (2) choose another candidate less likely to create compatibility issues -- perhaps \"v-props\".\r\n\r\n6. I *suspect* this would *not* just be syntactic sugar in the template compiler, since the compiler wouldn't know which keys to expect.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

These are really useful because class and style are often references to other things. That exact use-case applies to a lot of attributes that are involved in semantic and accessible markup.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the `aria-describedby` attribute which accepts a list of IDs and must have correct spacing to be compatible with all screenreaders; this list is often dynamic and often controlled externally so we would potentially need to combined local describedby with some coming in externally.\r\n\r\nDoing\r\n```\r\n:aria-describedby=\"trim(`${describedBy} ${componentId}-affix`)\"\r\n```\r\nworks, but if describedBy is a Boolean it would have to be evaluated separately to avoid printing 'false'. Essentially we have to rebuild whatever beautiful easiness the Vue engine already does for class and style in order to make sure our code is semantic.\r\n\r\nAttributes that would greatly benefit from this would be most [aria relationship attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#Relationship_attributes) as well as non-aria relationship type attributes like the `headers` attribute on a table cell.\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn ['error', 'hint']\r\n        .filter(prop => this[prop])\r\n        .map(prop => `${this.componentId}-${prop}`)\r\n        .join(' ').trim();\r\n```\r\nI have been doing a lot of weird code to get proper strings based on the values of nested data and realized this exact logic is already hidden somewhere in Vue.js. I think writing accessible code is extremely important and Vue should make it as simple as possible to do so. This (and perhaps a community standard way to set predictible IDs automatically) would make establishing semantic relationships between elements/components (the main accessibility challenge with dynamic js driven interfaces that are so popular these days) much simpler.\r\n\r\nBeing able to update the docs to call out these important attributes would be a great opportunity to push people toward writing more accessible code as well.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\n:aria-describedby=\"[describedBy, `${componentId}-affix`]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if there are specific issues with just allowing any attribute to behave this way, but that would be my preferred solution. If that is too difficult or causes particular performance concerns then adding that behaviour to specific attributes (those called out above, but I would have to review all valid html attributes to see which would make sense) would be a good alternative solution.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It means that `b` isn't set value in created hook and the `created` in component `a` dosen't trigger. \r\n\r\n1. We initialized a component, that's right\r\n```javascript\r\n   var a = Vue.component('test-a', {\r\n      data() {\r\n        return {\r\n          a: null\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      mounted() {\r\n        console.log(this.a.b);\r\n      },\r\n      mixins: [\r\n        {\r\n          created() {\r\n            this.a = { b: 1 }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      template: '<div></div>'\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n 2 But when we use `a.mixin` to mix an option that also contians a `mixins` property.  The previous `mixins` will be overridden by the current `mixins` property. This may be cased by using the `default` merge strategy rather than use concat to concat two `mixins` proerty. See relevant code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/52719ccab8fccffbdf497b96d3731dc86f04c1ce/src/core/util/options.js#L401\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    a.mixin({\r\n      methods: {\r\n        sayBye() {\r\n          console.log('Bye!');\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      mixins: [{\r\n        mounted() {\r\n          console.log('aaa');\r\n        }\r\n      }]\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. And when we change the root options by :\r\n```javascript\r\n   Vue.mixin({\r\n      created() {\r\n        this.sayTest();\r\n      },\r\n      methods: {\r\n        sayTest() {\r\n          console.log('hello test!');\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n4. The  root options has changed, and let's jump to the `init` component stage:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/52719ccab8fccffbdf497b96d3731dc86f04c1ce/src/core/instance/init.js#L108\r\nWe can see the `mixins` proerty in `Ctor.extendOptions` has been overrode.\r\n\r\n5. And when we are trying to  print `a.b` occurs an error. \r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n`1` should be output.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n `TypeError: Cannot read property 'b' of null`\r\n\r\n---\r\nI will send a PR if I have time\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Number should be blank and the type undefined.\r\n\r\nClick the button to switch pages but set the number to 10. The number is set and the type is number.\r\n\r\nYou can also confirm that the param is being set in the URL bar.\r\n\r\nNow reload the page (or copy the URL and load it in a fresh tab). The number will be set and display correctly, but the type will be string. You can confirm this in the Vue devtools.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nOn a fresh load or reload, the type of the \"number\" param should be the same as it was when it was set by Vue. The type should be number.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOn reload, the type changes to string.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFrankly I don't care which type vue router gives to me. I would prefer the parsing happens automatically, so I get a number, but if I know I'll get a string, I can always call parseInt myself. The important thing is that there is no difference in types between loading from another page vs loading for the first time from a URL. With many more query params of different types it is a pain (and code bloat) to handle the case where any of them can come in as a string or as the expected type.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The documentation has been the biggest source of my frustration while using Vue since it never actually explains anything.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the Vuex installation page, sandwiched between CDN/package manager installation and building from source, you've put that Vuex needs to be instantiated in a module set up. You've provided zero context for this. Is this in the store? Is this for every file you need to access the store in? More importantly, it shouldn't be on the installation page, let alone sandwiched in between different installation methods. Vue's documentation is riddled with these issues. Unfortunately, I still don't actually know enough about how Vue actually works to be able to contribute to the documentation in any way. If I didn't have to use Vue for the project I am on, I would be using React, Redux, & RxJs and have access to meaningful, better written documentation that bothers to walk you through the set up. If Vue actually wants to gain any real traction, you're going to need to actually show folks how to use and set up your tools.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

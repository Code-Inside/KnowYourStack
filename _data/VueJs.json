`set` method","State":"closed","Body":"### Vue version\r\n\r\n2.6.14\r\n\r\n### Link to minimal reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-6m9sxj?file=server.js\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Implement server side rendering in Vue\r\n2. Implement component caching in Vue\r\n3. Observe what is passed to `set` method inside `createRenderer` cache\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n\r\nAccording to [vue documentation](https://v2.ssr.vuejs.org/api/#cache) `set` method should receive second argument as a string:\r\n```ts\r\ntype RenderCache = {\r\n  get: (key: string, cb?: Function) => string | void;\r\n  set: (key: string, val: string) => void;\r\n  has?: (key: string, cb?: Function) => boolean | void;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `val` should have type `string`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n\r\nMethod `set` receives an object with this structure:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    html: '<some loong rendered html>',\r\n    components: Set(8) {\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook],\r\n        [Function: hook]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Any additional comments?\r\n\r\nI was trying to implement Redis for component caching. But due to the type of data passed to `set` method it is impossible to parse it as a string and store it in a cache. Redis is just removing `components` property:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    html: '<some loong rendered html>',\r\n    components: {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it break `vue-server-renderer`, because it expects components to be there:\r\n```js\r\n// node_modules/vue-server-renderer/build.dev.js:8399:26\r\nget(key, function (res) {\r\n  console.log({vsr_res_components: res?.components});\r\n  if (isDef(res)) {\r\n    if (isDef(registerComponent)) {\r\n      registerComponent(userContext);\r\n    }\r\n    res.components.forEach(function (register) { return register(userContext); }); // this breaks, because components are parsed to an empty object\r\n    write(res.html, next);\r\n  } else {\r\n    renderComponentWithCache(node, isRoot, key, context);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nVue docs are suggesting that this should be possible, by even giving an example:\r\n```js\r\nconst renderer = createRenderer({\r\n  cache: {\r\n    get: (key, cb) => {\r\n      redisClient.get(key, (err, res) => {\r\n        // handle error if any\r\n        cb(res)\r\n      })\r\n    },\r\n    set: (key, val) => {\r\n      redisClient.set(key, val) // but this does not work, as `val` is an object with Set and functions instead of a string, and it can not be stored in Redis\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI implemented it like this, but it does not work. I also couldn't find any example of working component caching with Redis. Is this even possible?","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/13175","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Component caching - wrong type returned in a `set` method\" (#13175)"},{"Id":"2187932318","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-15T08:26:29","Actor":"Dimas-e63s","Number":"13177","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dynamic component not rendering slot tree","State":"closed","Body":"### Vue version\n\n2.6.12\n\n### Link to minimal reproduction\n\nhttps://codepen.io/Dimi_0-o/pen/QWPKENG?editors=1010\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

By default the input is empty and the screen display all products.  \r\nIf the user writes \"food\" on the input, the application will execute an AJAX request (to fetch products that contain the word \"food\") and the URL will be updated to `#/products?search=food`.  \r\nIf then the user reloads the page, then the application (on the `mounted` hook) will read `$route.query.search` to populate the search input (with \"food\" on this case) and to only display the products that matches the search criteria.  \r\nThe requirement I have is that if the user edits the address bar (e.g. changing `#/products?search=food` to `#/products?search=electronics`) the application should detect the change and execute an AJAX request to update the list of products.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm using a flag, to indicate when the URL was changed my code, but I would like to know if the library has some built-in method that does the same:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwatch: {\r\n  $route() {\r\n    // Check if the change was done externally.\r\n    if (!this.internalRouteUpdate) {\r\n      // Re-fetch list of products.\r\n      const search = this.$route.query?.search || \"\";\r\n      this.fetchProducts(search);\r\n    } else {\r\n      // Reset flag.\r\n      this.internalRouteUpdate = false;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n\r\nmethods: {\r\n  fetchProducts(search) {\r\n    // ...execute AJAX request ...//\r\n\r\n    // Replace URL and update flag.\r\n    this.$router.replace(newLocation, () => {\r\n      this.internalRouteUpdate = true;\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\n> On this particular case, instead of using the `internalRouteUpdate` flag, I could just simply do `if(this.$route.query?.search !== currentSearch) this.fetchProducts(...);`, however that comparison will become complex once I start adding more filtering options to the screen.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3873","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Detect when the user changes the URL on the address bar by manually typing it\" (#3873)"},{"Id":"1987910861","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-11T15:03:13","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"3872","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(deps-dev): bump axios from 0.21.2 to 1.6.0","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) from 0.21.2 to 1.6.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios/releases\">axios's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release v1.6.0</h2>\n<h2>Release notes:</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CSRF:</strong> fixed CSRF vulnerability CVE-2023-45857 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/axios/axios/issues/6028\">#6028</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0\">96ee232</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>dns:</strong> fixed lookup function decorator to work properly in node v20; (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/axios/axios/issues/6011\">#6011</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/5aaff532a6b820bb9ab6a8cd0f77131b47e2adb8\">5aaff53</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>types:</strong> fix AxiosHeaders types; (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/axios/axios/issues/5931\">#5931</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/a1c8ad008b3c13d53e135bbd0862587fb9d3fc09\">a1c8ad0</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PRs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CVE 2023 45857 ( <a href=\"https://api.github.com/repos/axios/axios/pulls/6028\">#6028</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>\n⚠️ Critical vulnerability fix.

When running in development mode, the server's memory continued to rise with usage, whereas in production mode, it didn't happen.\r\n\r\nRan a profiler via Chrome's devtools and noticed that in development mode, there were large memory allocations for the __VUE_DEVTOOLS_PLUGINS__.  We also use vue-i18n and vue-router which also register devtools plugins when running in development mode.\r\n\r\nHowever, those other libraries make a check that they are executing in the browser or not in a Node environment, but Vuex does not.  As long as you are running in development mode (even on the server) it registers the devtools plugins.  I believe this is the cause of the sustained memory usage (possibly a leak?).\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR to fix this issue.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Use Vuex 4.0.2 with Vue 3 with SSR on a Node server process while running with NODE_ENV=development\r\n2. Make sure the usage includes registering store modules at runtime\r\n3. Notice that as the server processes more requests that use Vuex, the memory used by the server will rise and not come down.\r\n4. Notice that the same thing doesn't happen if you run the server with NODE_ENV=production\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nVuex not to add devtools on the server (even if NODE_ENV=development), client-side is fine.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Validations\n\n- [X] Follow our [Code of Conduct](https://vuejs.org/about/coc.html)\n- [X] Read the [docs](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).\n- [X] Check that there isn't already an issue that reports the same bug to avoid creating a duplicate.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/2250","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vuex Devtools plugins registered on server which increases memory usage\" (#2250)"},{"Id":"2407918102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-15T05:57:06","Actor":"LiYanyan-a","Number":"2249","RawContent":null,"Title":"使用mudule，在一个模块中commit另一个模块的mutations报unknown local mutation type","State":"open","Body":"createStore代码：\r\nimport getters from './getters'\r\nimport modules from './modules'\r\nimport { createStore } from 'vuex'\r\nconst store = createStore({\r\n  getters,\r\n  modules,\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport function setupStore(app) {\r\n  app.use(store);\r\n}\r\n被报找不到mutation type的模块代码\r\nimport * as R from 'ramda'\r\nimport http from '@/utils/http'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  namespaced: true,\r\n  state: {},\r\n  mutations: {\r\n    SET_DATA (state, { name, data }) {\r\n      state[name] = data\r\n    },\r\n    DEL_DATA (state, { name }) {\r\n    delete state[name]\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  actions: {\r\n    async get ({ commit, rootGetters }, { category, onFinally }) {\r\n     \r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/2249","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"使用mudule，在一个模块中commit另一个模块的mutations报unknown local mutation type\" (#2249)"},{"Id":"1842342465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-02T11:07:24","Actor":"heygsc","Number":"2231","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix : link pointing errors","State":"closed","Body":"The original link was not found and the computed attribute was not found in the Japanese version, so it was changed to the English version to avoid errors in the original link.\r\n\r\nissue :  https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/2232","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/2231","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix : link pointing errors\" (#2231)"},{"Id":"2337846098","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T09:54:28","Actor":"cug-zgj","Number":"2248","RawContent":null,"Title":"vuex3.6.2内存泄漏","State":"open","Body":"### Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n将vuex存储的数据使用计算属性引入，使用一个局部变量引用该计算属性，页面销毁前清除vuex的数据，该数据所占用的内容无法被释放\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```javascript\r\n//test.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <div style=\"display: flex;

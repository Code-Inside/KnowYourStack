the project.\r\n- Alternatively, on any vuejs project, set the `<img>`  `src` property to be `...`\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nA clean error message, saying that the developer set the image `src` property to `...` (Maybe copying some placeholder code),  which does not point to anything, and reporting the developer attention to the right file and right line number.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nA completely unrelated error message is printed out, regarding the `cache-loader` module, which was not even installed in my package.\r\nI may suggest (though, my Vue knowledge is limited about how it works this deep down, so take it with a grain of salt) that Vue is actually trying to parse the `...` string as a module name or cache id, and it isn't finding any match.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI copied some code from https://getbootstrap.org because I needed to recreate a specific design for a project, but then caught up in something else, and assumed that the code I copied would have worked. (With placeholder text and without any image, but it would have worked.)\r\nInstead of checking the web app, I went on working and coding other things and later I got the error you can check on the repository.\r\n```\r\nERROR  Failed to compile with 1 errors                                                                                                                                                                     11:42:48 PM\r\n\r\nThis dependency was not found:\r\n\r\n* ... in ./node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js?{\"cacheDirectory\":\"node_modules/.cache/vue-loader\",\"cacheIdentifier\":\"2deff992-vue-loader-template\"}!./node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/templateLoader.js??vue-loader-options!./node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!./node_modules/vue-loader/lib??vue-loader-options!./src/App.vue?vue&type=template&id=7ba5bd90&\r\n\r\nTo install it, you can run: npm install --save ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried nearly everything, from running `npm clean-install`, to removing my OS cache folder and rebooting, and then removing / downgrading modules, until I finally went back to older commits in my git history. Thankfully I could narrow it down and get why it wasn't working, but anyway I've thrown away a couple of hours and raised my stress level over the standard Monday average :)\r\nI'd have never though that Vue would misbehave so much for such an html error, and it will be nice if it'd be fixed.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Despite this, my example shows that a dynamic-and-async component *does* work sometimes (but only sometimes).\r\n\r\nBecause the docs are unclear, I can't actually claim that this is certainly a bug. If dynamic-and-async components are intended to work, it is. If they are not, then Vue should disallow the case that happens to work and/or print a warning in the console.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

See above for more details.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nFirst, document the feature:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n    $ npm test --help\r\n\r\n    npm test [--port <number>] [-- <args>] \r\n\r\n    aliases: tst, t\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, provide a suggestion when the issue is hit, as in this pseudo code change to test/e2e/runner.js:\r\n```javascript\r\n    try {\r\n        server.listen(server_port)\r\n    }\r\n    catch (err) {\r\n         if (err is EADDRINUSE) {\r\n            throw \"Port \"   server_port   \" is already in use.  You can change it by doing npm test --port <portnumber>\"\r\n        }\r\n        else  { \r\n            throw err;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThird, implement the feature.  The command line:\r\n```bash\r\n    $ npm test --port 8111\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried the above, and at first glance it looked to me like it was going to work:\r\n ```bash\r\n3sc3396:/home/scase/vue (dev *=) $ npm test --port 8111\r\n\r\n> vue@2.6.11 test /home/scase/vue\r\n> npm run lint && flow check && npm run test:types && npm run test:cover && npm run test:e2e -- --env phantomjs && npm run test:ssr && npm run test:weex \"8111\"\r\n```\r\n... but it eventually failed the same way as in the problem description. \r\n\r\nI found these hard-coded port numbers in `test/` which may have to change:\r\n```\r\n3sc3396:/home/scase/vue (dev *=) $ grep -r -i 8080 test\r\ntest/e2e/runner.js:server.listen(8080)\r\ntest/e2e/specs/commits.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/examples/commits/')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/todomvc.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/examples/todomvc/#test')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/todomvc.js:    browser.url('http://localhost:8080/examples/todomvc/#active')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/todomvc.js:    browser.url('http://localhost:8080/examples/todomvc/#completed')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/async-edge-cases.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/test/e2e/specs/async-edge-cases.html')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/modal.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/examples/modal/')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/grid.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/examples/grid/')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/basic-ssr.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/test/e2e/specs/basic-ssr.html')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/markdown.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/examples/markdown/')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/svg.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/examples/svg/')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/select2.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/examples/select2/')\r\ntest/e2e/specs/tree.js:    .url('http://localhost:8080/examples/tree/')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow casual contributors to run a complete test cycle more easily without disrupting anything they may have set up already.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I added noop beforeEach hook there because I want to prevent a resolution of the initial route meaning I don't want to show dashboard or login page before the authentication check is resolved. Only after the user is authenticated (or not) I am calling `resolveRoute` function and redirecting the user to the correct page. This worked great with vue-router <= 3.2.0, but something has changed in the newer version and I can't figure out how to fix it in my code or if it has to be fixed inside a vue-router.

There is a navigation guard for this: if user has not completed setup, do a redirect. When user logs in, app redirects him to home page via `router.push()`. And when user has not finished setup process, this will cause an error.\r\n\r\nThis behavior seems to be introduced in 3.3.0 by this commit https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/commit/4c727f9\r\n\r\nI don't know whether this is a bug or intentional behavior. If it's intentional, why was it introduced? For me it seems counter-intuitive that a simple redirect causes an error.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The action `changeContact` mimics the behaviour of an API call and commits a mutation after a delay of 1 second.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do is that when user navigates from one page to another, the modules of the first route should be unregistered. This can be done easily using the `unregisterModule` method. The problem is that any action or mutation calls executed before the unregistering are not removed and they throw errors in the browser Console.\r\n\r\nIn the above sandbox, when user switches from Contact to Home immediately, following things happen:\r\n- `Contact.vue` loads and it's mounted callback is called.\r\n- Inside the `mounted` callback, the `changeContact` action is called\r\n- User goes back to Home. This calls `beforeDestroy` of `Contact.vue` that un-registers the `contact` module.\r\n- The `changeContact` tries to call the `setContact` mutation, but, since the module does not exist, an error message is thrown in the Console `[vuex] unknown local mutation type: setContact, global type: contact/setContact`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

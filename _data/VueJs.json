in Vue 2.7.14","State":"open","Body":"### Vue version\r\n\r\n2.7.14\r\n\r\n### Link to minimal reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diegoexplicatis/vue-2-functional-component-memory-leak\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSee README.md of reproduction link\r\n\r\n##### Project setup\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Run project\r\n```\r\nnpm run serve\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### How to reproduct memory leak\r\n\r\n1. Open base url of project (printed in console)\r\n2. Click on \"Go to Test Component\"\r\n3. Click on Home\r\n4. Open developer tools and take a heap snapshot\r\n![take_heapsnaphot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e98484e3-991e-4945-a233-1597e271e4b4)\r\n\r\n5. Filter for \"Objects retained by detached DOM nodes\"\r\n![filter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fae526a-2c69-49fa-b4ea-1b1010317ab9)\r\n\r\n6. See there are detached elements, e.g. a paragraph element with id = testParagraph.\r\n![detached](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac6cb0d-cdb5-4a31-8c09-78552c9581fb)\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Manually trigger garbage collection\r\n![garbage_collection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ff03b25-ca80-4b99-b066-1d6cc63c4136)\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Take another heap snapshot and filter for \"Object retained by detached DOM nodes\" again\r\n9. See that e.g. the paragrpah is still being retained => paragraph element has leaked (it is detached from the DOM but is not being garbage collected)\r\n![not_collected](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb7311ce-77ec-4633-9c3f-a514de9fec03)\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Go to FunctionalComponent.vue to line 4 and change the parameter for functional to \"false\"\r\n11. Redo steps 1 - 8\r\n12. See that there are not detached elements (even without manually garbage collecting) => all elements have been properly garbage collected\r\n![no_detached](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/509c3535-d883-40cf-82b2-f26995268050)\r\n\r\nRepeatedly executing steps 2. and 3. leads to an increasing memory usage i.e. repeating the steps five times leads to five detached paragraph elements that do not get garbage collected!\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n\r\nI would expect that after executing steps 1-8,  e.g. the paragraph element is not being retained anymore and has been garbage collected independent of the value for the functional parameter in FunctionComponent.vue\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n\r\nInstead the paragraph element is being retained when using `functional: true` and does not get garbage collected.\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows

Open base url of project (printed in console)\r\n2. Click on \"Go to Test Component\"\r\n3. Click on Home\r\n4. Open developer tools and take a heap snapshot\r\n![take_heapsnaphot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e85d8d20-7f53-4cb2-97a0-21a51a0f1504)\r\n\r\n5.

Take another heap snapshot and filter for \"Object retained by detached DOM nodes\" again\r\n9. See that e.g. the paragrpah is still being retained => paragraph element has leaked (it is detached from the DOM but is not being garbage collected)\r\n![not_collected](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be59ae12-f1b5-441a-9a4f-e9363168dd3e)\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Go to FunctionalComponent.vue to line 4 and change the parameter for functional to \"false\"\r\n11. Redo steps 1 - 8\r\n12. See that there are not detached elements (even without manually garbage collecting) => all elements have been properly garbage collected\r\n![no_detached](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6600139d-43b2-46d5-b955-6d92a2b2393e)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that after executing steps 1-8,  e.g. the paragraph element is not being retained anymore and has been garbage collected independent of the value for the functional parameter in FunctionComponent.vue\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInstead the paragraph element is being retained when using `functional: true` and does not get garbage collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19045\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz\r\n    Memory: 6.27 GB / 23.86 GB\r\nBinaries:\r\n    Node: 18.15.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    npm: 9.5.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Edge: Chromium (128.0.2739.79)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.19041.4355\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n    vue: ^2.7.14 => 2.7.16\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3907","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Memory leak when using functional components with Vue router in Vue 2.7.14\" (#3907)"},{"Id":"2515161068","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-11T21:36:47","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"3905","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(deps-dev): bump path-to-regexp from 1.8.0 to 8.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"Bumps [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) from 1.8.0 to 8.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases\">path-to-regexp's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Simpler API</h2>\n<p>Heads up!

When running in development mode, the server's memory continued to rise with usage, whereas in production mode, it didn't happen.\r\n\r\nRan a profiler via Chrome's devtools and noticed that in development mode, there were large memory allocations for the __VUE_DEVTOOLS_PLUGINS__.  We also use vue-i18n and vue-router which also register devtools plugins when running in development mode.\r\n\r\nHowever, those other libraries make a check that they are executing in the browser or not in a Node environment, but Vuex does not.  As long as you are running in development mode (even on the server) it registers the devtools plugins.  I believe this is the cause of the sustained memory usage (possibly a leak?).\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR to fix this issue.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Use Vuex 4.0.2 with Vue 3 with SSR on a Node server process while running with NODE_ENV=development\r\n2. Make sure the usage includes registering store modules at runtime\r\n3. Notice that as the server processes more requests that use Vuex, the memory used by the server will rise and not come down.\r\n4. Notice that the same thing doesn't happen if you run the server with NODE_ENV=production\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nVuex not to add devtools on the server (even if NODE_ENV=development), client-side is fine.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Validations\n\n- [X] Follow our [Code of Conduct](https://vuejs.org/about/coc.html)\n- [X] Read the [docs](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).\n- [X] Check that there isn't already an issue that reports the same bug to avoid creating a duplicate.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/2250","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vuex Devtools plugins registered on server which increases memory usage\" (#2250)"},{"Id":"2407918102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-15T05:57:06","Actor":"LiYanyan-a","Number":"2249","RawContent":null,"Title":"使用mudule，在一个模块中commit另一个模块的mutations报unknown local mutation type","State":"open","Body":"createStore代码：\r\nimport getters from './getters'\r\nimport modules from './modules'\r\nimport { createStore } from 'vuex'\r\nconst store = createStore({\r\n  getters,\r\n  modules,\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport function setupStore(app) {\r\n  app.use(store);\r\n}\r\n被报找不到mutation type的模块代码\r\nimport * as R from 'ramda'\r\nimport http from '@/utils/http'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  namespaced: true,\r\n  state: {},\r\n  mutations: {\r\n    SET_DATA (state, { name, data }) {\r\n      state[name] = data\r\n    },\r\n    DEL_DATA (state, { name }) {\r\n    delete state[name]\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  actions: {\r\n    async get ({ commit, rootGetters }, { category, onFinally }) {\r\n     \r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/2249","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"使用mudule，在一个模块中commit另一个模块的mutations报unknown local mutation type\" (#2249)"},{"Id":"1842342465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-02T11:07:24","Actor":"heygsc","Number":"2231","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix : link pointing errors","State":"closed","Body":"The original link was not found and the computed attribute was not found in the Japanese version, so it was changed to the English version to avoid errors in the original link.\r\n\r\nissue :  https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/2232","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/2231","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix : link pointing errors\" (#2231)"},{"Id":"2337846098","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-06T09:54:28","Actor":"cug-zgj","Number":"2248","RawContent":null,"Title":"vuex3.6.2内存泄漏","State":"open","Body":"### Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n将vuex存储的数据使用计算属性引入，使用一个局部变量引用该计算属性，页面销毁前清除vuex的数据，该数据所占用的内容无法被释放\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```javascript\r\n//test.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <div style=\"display: flex;

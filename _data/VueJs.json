(you can see there is also no console warning related to `someString`).\r\n\r\n- Remove the word \"default\" from the comment & refresh the page - props will initialize correctly & you also have the expected console warning.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLooks very similar to several issues (such as [this one](https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/6318) & [this one](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/6320))\r\n\r\nApparently this has been fixed [here](https://github.com/vuejs/core/commit/81a7819535c4382ba7817c817722bac6d41921d8).\r\n\r\nHowever it fails to work for me when `@babel/parser` is upgraded beyond `7.19.6` \r\n🟢 [Working use case with 7.19.6](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-4he33m?file=src%2FApp.vue)\r\n🛑 [Non-working use case with 7.20.0](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-8pnft9?file=src%2FApp.vue)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging it seems that the method `hasDefaultExport` in `vuejs/vue` is the one that's broken for this case & the one in `vuejs/core` is working.\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/main/packages/compiler-sfc/src/rewriteDefault.ts#L91-L93\r\n\r\nThis regex change [here](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/5937) would cause some unit tests (for my use case) start to fail.  And for me this regex is maybe too loose.\r\n\r\nHere 👉 there's no default export, yet this regex is a match https://regex101.com/r/LmYL8l/1\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI expect my component to be built correctly & to not have a comment impacting the behavior of my component.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen inspecting the compiled code - it looks to me that the `@Component` decorator here is just completely stripped in the outputted code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n🙈  I've probably mistakenly opened an issue on `vue/core` [here](https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/8858)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWorkaround for me, is to override `@babel/parser` for `@vue/sfc-compiler` to be `7.19.6` and the problem disappears.\r\n\r\nRemoving the exported const/type/interface/etc from the SFC works around the issue.\r\n\r\nMoving the exported const/interface/type/etc below the class component also works around the issue.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not isolated to only comments, but rather the presence of `default`.\r\nMeaning, code such as `@Prop({ type: String, required: false, default: '' })` is also breaking - as the word `default` here has the same impact.\r\n\r\n💡 I've attempted a sort of \"backport\" of the changes from `vue/core` & added a test for my use case. It looks to work.\r\nhttps://github.com/andrewbrennanfr/vue/commits/fix/rewriteDefault-decorator-parsing\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

So Prettier is installed anyway and everything works.\r\n\r\nBut if some project has `Prettier@3`, then `@vue/compiler-sfc` uses project's prettier and fails.\r\n\r\nThere was the same issue early in [component-compiler-utils](https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils). See:\r\n- https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/commit/aea1b79765f0f6d688e64b7698d5ff62862002d1\r\n- https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/pull/89\r\n\r\nThis PR specifies Prettier as an `optionalDependency` of `@vue/compiler-sfc`. With specified dependency, it will use `prettier@2` even if a project has `prettier@3`.\r\n\r\nP.S. I used the same versions as it was in the `component-compiler-utils`. It seems it has the same code.\r\n\r\n**Alternative solution:** make `@vue/compiler-sfc` compatible with both `Prettier@\"1 || 2\"` and `Prettier@3`. The problem is that it will make the compile function async.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/13053","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"chore(compiler-sfc): specify prettier version (fix #13052)\" (#13053)"},{"Id":"1802951392","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-13T12:46:51","Actor":"kingyue737","Number":"13052","RawContent":null,"Title":"compiler-sfc not compatible with prettier v3","State":"open","Body":"### Version\r\n2.7.14\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\nI think it's not necessary as it's obvious in source code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nInstall prettier v3  in a project depending on vue/compiler-sfc v2\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNo error\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nFail in compiling template.\r\n\r\nI found compiler-sfc tried to format code with API of prettier but `format` of Prettier becomes async in v3 and it returns a Promise instead of string.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/49b6bd4264c25ea41408f066a1835f38bf6fe9f1/packages/compiler-sfc/src/compileTemplate.ts#L179\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The single-page routing file references the CommonRouter, uses addRoutes to add dynamic routing, and prompts the page : \r\n`vue-router.esm.js:16  [vue-router] router.addRoutes() is deprecated and has been removed in Vue Router 4. Use router.addRoute() instead`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport router from 'lib/CommonRouter';\r\nconst LayoutView = () => import(\"@/components/LayoutView/index.vue\");\r\nconst WelcomeIndex= () => import(\"@/pages/welcome/views/home/index.vue\");\r\n\r\nrouter.addRoutes([{\r\n    path: '/',\r\n    component: LayoutView,\r\n    children: [{\r\n        path: 'index',\r\n        name: 'welcomeIndex',\r\n        component: WelcomeIndex\r\n    }]\r\n}],);\r\nexport default router\r\n```\r\n3. So use addRoute, the page directly error, prompt :  `Uncaught Error: [vue-router] \"path\" is required in a route configuration`\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\naddRoutes and addRoute One of them is available and error-free\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThere is a warning prompt when using addRoutes, and an error is reported directly when using addRoute\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

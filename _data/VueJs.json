I would expect this to always be one or the other, or to be resolved in order of declaration as when merging objects in JS ({...boundProps, specificProp })\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe precedence is determined based on whether a prop has multiple words. duplicate keys are set by the object when they are declared in dash-case, and set by the prop/attribute if they are camelCase or a single word.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis can be made 'consistent' by declaring multiword props using camelcase, but that's against the recommendations in the styleguide which suggest using dash case for multiword props inside templates: https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Prop-name-casing-strongly-recommended.\r\n\r\nI ran into this when an undefined value bound to a parent was overriding the same value explicitly set in the child, but it wasn't happening consistently depending on what the names of the props were.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When I customized a vue directive \"myFocus\" to make the input element auto-focus, it does not work and console is reporting a warning. However when using a customized directive \"myfocus\", it works well. The only difference is whether the directive is in lower or upper case. I am not really sure if this is a bug in vue, as I am new to vue. Please kindly take a minute to check.\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n    <div id=\"area\">\r\n        User's input: <input type=\"text\" v-myFocus>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <!-- <div id=\"area\">\r\n        User's input: <input type=\"text\" v-myfocus>\r\n    </div> -->\r\n    \r\n    <script>\r\n        /* Custom directve \"myFocus\" does not work */\r\n        // Message from console: [Vue warn]: Failed to resolve directive: myfocus\r\n        Vue.directive(\"myFocus\", {\r\n            inserted: function(el){\r\n                el.focus();\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        /* Custom directive \"myfocus\" works normally */\r\n        // Vue.directive(\"myfocus\", {\r\n        //     inserted: function(el){\r\n        //         el.focus();\r\n        //     }\r\n        // });\r\n\r\n        var vm = new Vue({\r\n            el: \"#area\",\r\n            data: {}\r\n        });\r\n    </script>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIn both scenarios, the input element should get focus automatically upon page load.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe custom directive with capitalized letter will not work. However the one without capitalized letter works.\r\n\r\n---\r\nPlease kindly see my code in the Steps to reproduce area, also I've linked a repo to demonstrate the bug.\r\nThe version 2.6.7 vue.js is also in the repo.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like if `document.createEvent('Event').timeStamp` returns a unix timestamp, the result of this check is unpredictable, and is sometimes true and sometimes false.\r\n\r\nRunning the following in the IE 11 console when in IE 9 emulation mode sometimes returns true and sometimes false:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nDate.now() > document.createEvent('Event').timeStamp\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis check can also fail in IE 11 in IE 10 emulation mode, so it probably affects IE 10 as well.\r\n\r\nA possible workaround would be to check for something like `getNow() > document.createEvent('Event').timeStamp   1000`, though that still seems a bit brittle.\r\n\r\nIn my testing in a Windows 10 VM, the difference for `Date.now() - document.createEvent('Event').timeStamp` was usually  /- 2 ms, but sometimes I also got larger offsets, like Date.now() around 22 ms larger than timeStamp.\r\n\r\nThis problem could also be influenced by clock correction, when NTP or the VM host corrects the guest time between calls.\r\n\r\nGenerally comparisons of realtime clocks in computers is error prone and only monotonic timers should be trusted, which is probably one of the reasons why `performance.now()` was created…\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

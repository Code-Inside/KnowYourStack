Use the CLI tool of \"Snyk\" (https://snyk.io/) or \"Tenable\" (https://www.tenable.com/) on a repository built on Vue 2.\r\n2. When you use the CLI tool to check for vulnerabilities, you will find the vulnerability checker raises a high severity issue for the \"lodash.template\" package which is a dependency for the \"vue-server-renderer\" package.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIt should not raise a vulnerability issue for the above-mentioned package.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt raises a high-severity issue for the above-mentioned package.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhile running a security check for the packages used in our company's repository using SNYK and Tenable, it returned a high-severity issue for the \"lodash.template\" package (v4.5.0) which is introduced as a part of the \"vue-server-renderer\" package (v2.7.14). Our CI/CD pipelines are introducing a rule which would not allow a deployment to execute if there are high-severity vulnerabilities in the repository.\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 6 46 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9171367/234899090-80f8c291-f9da-496d-a538-b67ef9a7819c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

In Overload 3 of `defineComponent`, `props` is always defined so there's no need to check if `props` is defined or not by using `HasDefined` type, then we inlined `ExtractPropTypes<PropsOptions>` (the default type of the removed `Props` generic).","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/13004","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(types): fix method-based emits with props\" (#13004)"},{"Id":"1670286164","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-17T02:19:17","Actor":"kingyue737","Number":"13002","RawContent":null,"Title":"Export types of built-in components","State":"open","Body":"### What problem does this feature solve?\r\nVue 2.7 does not export types of built-in components like `Transition` and `TransitionGroup` (In Vue 3 they are exported via `@vue/runtime-dom`).

However, when rendering an async functional component, the built version of `vue-server-renderer` has its own definition of `FunctionalRenderContext` (appears to be bundled at build time along with things like `createFunctionalComponent` instead of importing from vue itself at runtime) which does not have the SSR helpers on it.\r\n\r\nSetting `optimizeSSR: false` in `vue-loader` options seems to work as a bandaid solution since the optimization helpers are not used, but this seems like a bad idea for performance.\r\nEDIT: also, changing it to a regular component (not functional) also works as a workaround\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

MapGetters and had the same problem.\r\nUsing $store.getters.count directly in the template solve the issue, but in my real application with multiple modules it is simply not pratical, especially

The original code was also returning the new caught promise, which meant that it then also needed to re-reject the promise so that the app code can carry on unaffected (as if the promise had never been caught in the first place. This was done by throwing the promise rejection reason as an error. This has a side effect of causing the browser's own devtools to pause when using the \"pause on exceptions\" feature, because from the browser's perspective this is an uncaught exception - an error has been thrown, and the browser is not concerned about whether this is happening in a promise, or whether the promise rejection is subsequently handled safely. Since there's no \"real\" error here, this behaviour can be annoying during development when testing code that should be resilient to promise rejections.\r\n\r\nHowever, the need to throw an error can be avoided entirely if the caught promise is not what gets returned by the action - the promise can be caught for the purpose of notifying the devtools hook, while still returning the original un-caught promise.

The issue occurs when `store._devtoolHook` is defined in the Vuex source.\r\n\r\n- Configure the browser's devtools debugger to break on exceptions (but not on caught exceptions) - e.g. in Firefox devtools go to the Debugger tab, expand the Breakpoints pane, and tick \"Pause on exceptions\"\r\n- Open the CodeSandbox demo with devtools open, and the Vue devtools extension installed\r\n- Observe that the devtools debugger will pause on a line of Vuex `throw err;`\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe devtools debugger should not pause, because no error was thrown in the app code. A promise was rejected, but it was also caught and handled properly, so there's no error.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThis error is being thrown as part of Vuex's function to register an action, where promise rejections are caught and emitted for the devtools hook, and then the promise rejection reason is thrown in order to re-reject the promise so that the app code is unaware that Vuex had handled the rejection at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, throwing an error also triggers the browser's \"pause on exceptions\" handler, even though this particular code is not technically \"erroring\".\r\n\r\nA safer way to handle re-rejecting the promise is to simply return a rejected promise instance using `return Promise.reject(err);`. An even better way would be to not return the caught promise at all, and simply return the original promise. \r\n\r\n---\r\nI believe the same `throw` code is being used in Vuex 4.x however I haven't tested that build to confirm.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a developer experience improvement and is NOT a bug in production environments. I've confirmed this issue in Firefox Developer Edition.\r\n\r\nA real-world example: I have an app where I have used Vuex actions to load resources from an API and cache them in the Vuex store. These API requests are promise-based (fetch) and this promise is returned by the action in order for the calling code to await the request. In some situations the API request will fail and reject the promise *without throwing an error*, which is then caught and handled properly. However despite my code being resilient, my devtools debugger will always pause because Vuex is deliberately throwing an error.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

My answer to that would be it would make Vuex significantly more developer-friendly and make a significantly better developer experience. Which is the reason why Vue was created in the first place - to create a approachable/developer-friendly way to build user interfaces. A bunch of people agreed that the feature would be a good thing. Closed.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/is-it-possible-to-declare-a-watcher-inside-a-vuex-store/50375  \r\n@mikepatton75 asks if it's possible. The answer is no. Then a bunch of talk about his use-case which didn't need to happen if Vuex just had a watch option, right? Either way, there is no discussion as to WHY the feature isn't available in the Vuex API. So, that's a dead-end as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/vuex-can-i-use-watch-feature-inside-a-vuex-module/75633  \r\n@lwxbr says he does an \"extensive workaround\" to make a watcher in a store for his use-case, then opens an issue.  But, all he needed was a just simple watcher, right?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1624  \r\n@lwxbr opens the issue. Closed with reference back to #1219 that didn't have an answer.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.vuejs.org/t/can-a-vuex-module-register-a-watcher-to-watch-its-local-state/8003  \r\n@jri asks if a store can watch its own state, but with an obscurely worded question about a circular file import that is pretty easy to fix with using a 3rd file. But, it never got answered, probably because the question was too obscure? But, perhaps the reason why it was obscure was probably because @jri just needed a simple watcher, but didn't have it, so it was hard to explain the problem in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nPlenty of people have already done this and have been ignored. So, that has proven to be unproductive. I'm simply asking a question \"why\" and am requesting an answer and/or productive discussion about it so that developers who have the same thought in the future have a productive place to look and understand why Vuex doesn't have a watch option.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to hear from a creator of Vuex with in-depth knowledge about Vuex/Vue as well as the philosophies behind them.\r\n\r\nPlease do not give just a random answer like, \"it's not necessary\" because, don't forget, Vue \"isn't necessary\" either. Let's all use Vanilla! \r\n\r\nI myself am a creator of a UI framework that I designed for beginner developers to learn JavaScript while also making UI frameworks easier to learn later on down the road. I've even taught Vue+Vuex to an entire development team at a company. So, I know how important the core philosophy of a library is.\r\n\r\nI have utmost respect for the developers of Vue and Vuex for making such incredible libraries, and I would hope to have that respect reciprocated with an actual productive discussion into this core feature.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

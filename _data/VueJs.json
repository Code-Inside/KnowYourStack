I need to prevent Vue from trying to create observers for content cells.\r\n\r\nNote: in my test application the data is actually in Vuex -- however it is only when I access it to display a chunk that I run into a bottleneck, so I believe it is a Vue problem.

And in a lot of cases I've faced a pattern like this: the string should be either null or not empty. So for now I need to write a lot of workarounds about it, which result in a lot of copy-paste code in all of my components, since custom modifiers are not implemented.\r\nSo my proposal is: add the .nullify modifier to v-model, that would set the value to null if it's an empty string.\r\n\r\nI think that can benefit not only me, but also other users, as I've seen a lot of upvotes here, where the user suggested it: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/3666#issuecomment-289095184\r\nI can and will make a PR on that if most of the people would think it's a good idea.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\n<input type=\"text\" v-model.nullify=\"value\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan also work with other modifiers, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<input type=\"text\" v-model.trim.nullify=\"value\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat'd give us null if the `value` is either empty or contains only tabs and spaces.\r\n\r\nAlso that can work with numbers (I've also faced a few cases where the value should be either a number or null):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<input type=\"text\" v-model.number.nullify=\"value\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.\r\n  Type 'FunctionConstructor' is not comparable to type '() => ConfirmCallback'.\r\n\r\n13     confirmCallback: Function as PropType<ConfirmCallback>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAs converting to `unknown` first is somewhat unwieldy (and seems not to work in a SFC   Vetur setup, maybe this should be looked into separately), it would be nice to have a helper function exposed by Vue such as the following...\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { PropType } from \"vue\";\r\n\r\nexport default function TypedFunctionProp<T>(): PropType<T> {\r\n  return (Function as unknown) as PropType<T>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n... which would allow writing the following:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport Vue, { PropType, TypedFunctionProp } from \"vue\";\r\n\r\ninterface User {\r\n  name: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype ConfirmCallback = (confirm: boolean) => void;\r\n\r\nexport default Vue.extend({\r\n  name: \"MyComponent\",\r\n  props: {\r\n    user: Object as PropType<User>,\r\n    confirmCallback: TypedFunctionProp<ConfirmCallback>()\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would be willing to write a PR for this, but I'm not sure where to put the definition of the `TypedFunctionProp` function as it can't be put in the declaration file.\r\n\r\nI'm also completely open to having a different name for that function. Maybe `FunctionPropType` is more consistent. I've actually switched to `FnPropType` in the project I'm working on, as it's relatively short, and is consistent with the `PropType` name.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The QT version used is quite old and so is the included QtWebEngine fork of Chrome. The upgrade from Vue 2.5 to 2.6 broke event bubbling in this older version of chrome, apparently because `event.timeStamp` is a very negative number (such as -518605237).\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* add$1 */\r\ne.target === e.currentTarget // false since we are clicking children of the div\r\n\r\ne.timeStamp >= attachedTimestamp // false since -518605237 < 0\r\n\r\ne.timeStamp === 0 // false since -518605237 != 0\r\n\r\ne.target.ownerDocument !== document // false since we are the same document\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a way to disable the microtask behaviour for this browser?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

set array to query","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.6.14\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/bitter-river-bewtih?file=/pages/index.vue)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nImagine using this function to push the changes to query when user play with the website filters:\r\n```\r\nasync pushQuery(inputs) {\r\n      const query = Object.assign({}, this.$route.query);\r\n\r\n      // if we are in page 5 for example when adding new filter we need to reset back to the first page!\r\n      if (query.page) {\r\n        delete query.page;\r\n      }\r\n      // In case we are doing the same filter need to toggle!\r\n      for (const input of inputs) {\r\n        if (query[input.key] === input.value) {\r\n          delete query[input.key];\r\n          if (!query[input.key]) return;\r\n          return await this.$router.push({ query });\r\n        }\r\n       // formating the array form of query\r\n        if (Array.isArray(input.value)) {\r\n          input.key = input.key + \"[]\";\r\n        }\r\n       // making the query\r\n        query[input.key] = input.value;\r\n        if (input.value === \"\" || !input.value) {\r\n          delete query[input.key];\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n     // finally we will push the new query\r\n      await this.$router.push({ query });\r\n    }, \r\n```\r\nnow everything is going to work fine the first time using this code, the problem will occur when the user has already changed some filters, let's say we have a dropdown filter called \"country\" and it's already set to \"Canada\" and \"France\", this is the result:\r\n https://website.com/find-tutors?country%5B%5D=Canada&country%5B%5D=France\r\nIf user try **reloading** the page then add or remove some countries, vue will fail to add changes to the path.\r\n\r\nIn order to make vue realize these changes I found 2 solutions:\r\nWe can add a new query like :\r\n```\r\n      query.changed = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000);\r\n\r\n```\r\nright before we call router.push .\r\n\r\nShuffling the country array (using underscore library e.g.) can also give us the results we are looking for.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nhttps://website.com/find-tutors?country%5B%5D=Canada&country%5B%5D=France&country%5B%5D=Iraq&country%5B%5D=Ukraine\r\n\r\n### What is actually

`<template v-if=\"true\" v-custom />` where `v-custom` simply logs directive hooks. Observe that with the `v-if` present, no hooks are called. Removing the `v-if` causes the hooks to be called again.\r\n\r\n**What is expected?**\r\nThe directive hooks should run as normal regardless of the presence of the `v-if`.\r\n\r\n**What is actually happening?**\r\nThe hooks are not called.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe fiddle I've linked includes a number of other combinations looking for potential workarounds. None of them work as I expect when using the `template` tag. Based on my understanding:\r\n\r\n1. example 1 turns on and off as expected, however the directive hooks do not run\r\n2. example 2 runs the directive hooks, however the content is not rendered\r\n3. example 3 runs the directive hooks, however the content is not rendered\r\n4. example 4 does not render the content\r\n5. example 5 works totally as expected (with a `p` tag)\r\n\r\nExamples 2 through 4 appear to render as `<template>#document-fragment...`.

This gets very difficult though if you want to edit a route that has children. Because the route's `children` property does not update when `addRoute` and `removeRoute` are used, to make a truly robust \"edit route\" function we would have to construct a new children array by searching through `router.getRoutes()` for the children's names to make sure that they still exist and are up to date. This gets even more complicated if a route's children have children. \r\n\r\nMy use case is that I and trying to dynamically disable routes based on the capabilities of an API server, and I've run into a problem where a parent route needs to be unnavigable but its dynamic routes still need to be navigable. I would like to do this by simply setting the parent route to redirect to a 404 page rather than one of its children. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would propose a router function named `editRoute` that takes an existing route name and an object of changes to make to that route\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nrouter.editRoute(routeName: string | symbol, changes: Partial<RouteRecordRaw>): () => void\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Anyone that watches a tutorial on databinding with vuex will surely have puked and ran away. It's a shame. \r\n\r\nIf there is no better concept, just create all these mindless getter setter and mutator methods IMPLICITLY unless definedI. I perhaps fail to understand how that is not better in any case (if properly communicated that this happens).\r\n\r\nI think C# does something similar:\r\n\r\nC# property sample:\r\n`public int Age { get; set; } `\r\n\r\nIs the **same** as:\r\n`private int age;`\r\n`public int Age`\r\n`{`\r\n `   public get { return this.age; }`\r\n`    public set { this.age = value; }`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\n\r\nBtw, if you want read only, in C# you can make the setter private for example:\r\n`public string Age { get; private set; }`\r\n\r\nWorks since 2012 or so.

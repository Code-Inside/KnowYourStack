When building the SDK from source for Linux, we cannot download packages from the internet that we don't produce during our build. Microsoft.Web.XDT is consumed by NuGet.Client and also produced during a .NET build from source. We rely on using the property `MicrosoftWebXdtPackageVersion` to override the version used in this repo with the one we need at build-time. The change https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/commit/20be995d651808feb5cd48f30cb97197e497377c resulted in using a hardcoded version of 3.0.0. Instead, we should use the version `MicrosoftWebXdtPackageVersion` if it exists, otherwise use version 3.0.0 (or whatever other version this repo might need).\r\n\r\nWe can work around this right now using a patch, but this will need to be fixed as it is a regression ever since NuGet.Client adopted central package version management.\r\n\r\n### Verbose

If so, with which NuGet version: New scenario for us\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a Pipelines Docker-based build agent using steps similar to those at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/docker?view=azure-devops#windows and using the `--once` agent option.\r\n\r\n2. Use the resulting image with Docker Swarm on a 32-core host (so there are a couple of dozen agents running simultaneously).\r\n\r\n3. Start multiple builds for solutions containing 100+ projects each with restore steps, using a nuget.config containing `<add key='maxHttpRequestsPerSource' value='4' />`.\r\n\r\nWhat we are seeing is failures validating packages from nuget.org (`PackageSignatureValidity: False`). The failures appear nondeterministic -- the specific packages that succeed or fail look to be different each time, and the number of packages failing during a given run is not consistent either -- but the failure becomes more probable if more than one container's agent is restoring simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAdding the `-DisableParallelProcessing` flag seems to make the problem go away, at the cost of a longer time to restore, while lowering `maxHttpRequestsPerSource` seems to have no effect.\r\n\r\nSpeculation: each container sees itself has having 32 CPUs, so NuGet starts 32 concurrent restore jobs (if parallel processing is left on). The error messages suggest some sort of failure during certificate validation; assuming the certificate doesn't change but the outcome does, perhaps a request rate limit is being hit somewhere?\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n(Excerpts)\r\n\r\n> NU3028: Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository primary signature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.\r\n> NU3018: Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository primary signature found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.\r\n> Errors in C:\\vsts\\_work\\1\\s\\Web\\<project_name>.csproj\r\n>     NU3028: Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository primary signature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.\r\n>     NU3018: Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository primary signature found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.\r\n\r\nLater:\r\n\r\n> PackageSignatureVerificationLog: PackageIdentity: Microsoft.AspNet.Razor.3.2.3 Source: https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json PackageSignatureValidity: False\r\n> Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': Signature Hash Algorithm: SHA256\r\n> Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': Timestamp: 12/14/2018 5:55:55 AM\r\n> \r\n> Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': Verifying repository primary signature's timestamp with timestamping service certificate: \r\n>   Subject Name: CN=Symantec SHA256 TimeStamping Signer -

OS 20.04 installed using Hyper-V (enhanced session enabled, if that matters).\r\n\r\nIn the VM I have installed dotnet-sdk-3.1 and https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider (since my dotnet project uses private NuGet feeds).\r\n\r\nI have a .NET Core project inside of the Pop! OS VM. I'm trying to restore the dependencies using `dotnet restore`. As soon as I invoke that command, my internet connection breaks (both in the VM and the host). \r\nThe `dotnet restore` itself throws lots of errors like this one:\r\n\r\n> The SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception. Unable to read data from the transport connection: Connection reset by peer.\r\n\r\nSometimes there are also timeouts.\r\n\r\nWhen I do `dotnet restore --interactive` the only difference is that initially I am asked to perform DEVICE authentication in the browser by providing some code. After that the same issue happens.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that helps in that situation is to stop the `dotnet restore` process and to turn off and turn back on my wi-fi connection (in the host). Only that restores my internet connection.\r\n\r\nI tried the same steps multiple times:\r\n\r\n1. Run `ping 8.8.8.8` in one terminal window (on Pop! OS)\r\n2. Run `dotnet restore` in the other terminal window (on Pop! OS)\r\n\r\nAround 2 seconds after I do the second step, ping from the first terminal stops receiving responses.\r\n\r\nWhat could be wrong? My VM uses the \"Default Switch\" of Hyper-V. I did not do any special network setup. It's just a fresh installation of Pop! OS 20.04.\r\n\r\nThe same project resolved completely fine on my host and on an Ubuntu VM."},{"Id":"14291006184","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-23T21:52:52","Actor":"zkat","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10285","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"VS2019 Nuget Package Manager can not show Project Name, but relative path of .csproj file.\" (#10285) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity2.visualstudio.com/t/VS2019-Nuget-Package-Manager-can-not-sho/618165)._\n\n---\nIDE: **Visual Studio 2019 16.1.3**\nNuGet **Package Manager: 5.1.0**\nPlatform: **C#, .Net Framework 4.8**\n\n### What:\nThe Nuget Package Manager can not show the name of Project, but the relative path of *.csproj file, just like in my screenshot.\n**Specially, only projects which using PackageReference display this relative path of file, and projects using packages.config display project's name normally.**\nI don't know whether it's a bug or feature.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 6/24/2019, 02:27 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

We want to break up this package into smaller, more granular packages with minimal impact on existing consumers.\r\n* To achieve this, we created a number of smaller packages \"MicroPackage1\", \"MicroPackage2\", .. \"MicroPackageN\" containing the various types that used to live in Monolith. We also added type forwards to Monolith.dll so that other packages that reference Monolith still work when installed in an app using the latest Monolith.\r\n\r\nWhere this breaks down is if an app using an _old_ version of Monolith installs a package which takes MicroPackage1 as a dependency. The problem is that the latest Monolith depends on MicroPackage1, but there is no way for MicroPackage1 to communicate that it is not compatible with older versions of Monolith.\r\n\r\nWe've seen this need come up in other cases as well, basically whenever we need to perform some kind of migration to a new package structure.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to express these incompatibilities in the nuspec such that consumers would find out about them upon trying to install the package.\r\n\r\nDetails (probably not relevant for this feature request):\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): GeneratePackageOnBuild target (with .nuspec file).\r\n\r\nNuGet version (5.7.0):\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): Windows 10\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"14085142486","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-05T00:13:18","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/48","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"November dry run for custom V2 OData query deprecation\" (#48) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"\r\nWe announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/37) last year and we will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in **February 2021**. \r\n\r\nWe will conduct **a dry run of the OData deprecation** to ensure that there are no surprises for users, which is scheduled to ensure overlap with normal working hours across the globe.

This means that once a user has selected a tab, they must still tab navigate through the remaining inactive tabs before they can access the tab content.\r\n\r\n**Previously,**\r\n![20220325_182528](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82980589/160219270-24b3d6af-42ae-484e-a867-cbae22dbc822.gif)\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\n\r\nI added an event listener for left and right arrow keys, and changed the tab in focus based on the input. I used keyUp as the trigger here rather than keyDown, because adding an event listener for keyDown also messed with other keyboard functionality (eg. 'tab' and 'enter' keys) when focused on the tab element.\r\n\r\nTo enable this, I also made it such that only the selected/expanded tab has _tabindex=\"0\"_ and receives tab focus sequentially with other elements on the page, while all inactive tabs have _tabindex=\"-1\"_, and can only receive focus when using left/right arrow keys from their active sibling tab. Once a new tab is made active, we set _tabindex=\"-1\"_ on the previous tab, and _tabindex=\"0\"_ on the new active tab.\r\n\r\n**After the changes,**\r\n![20220325_181409](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82980589/160219028-f8bd7c95-7efc-410a-8d32-3140726d749d.gif)"},{"Id":"20982767661","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T21:52:05","Actor":"ryuyu","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9074","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[A11y]Enable dismissing Verified tooltip with esc\" (#9074) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Currently, when navigated to by keyboard, the verified tooltip cannot be dismissed without tabbing away from the icon.\r\nThis change enables dismissing this tooltip by usage of the esc key for all locations where this tooltip is used.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus it also fixes a bug that could cause the tooltip to stop working altogether when clicked on."},{"Id":"20982504674","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T21:32:10","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9078","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Reduce the amount of magic numbers in JS code in Gallery\" (#9078) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Gallery JS code is ridden with magic numbers:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L12\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L244\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L574-L578\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/autocomplete.js#L64-L67\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFor better code readability it would be nice to provide nice names at least for some of them (key codes, for example).

However, the ZIP standard allows for alternative compressions (see section [4.4.3 here](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT)), with libraries like [`libzip`](https://libzip.org/) (and its managed wrapper [`LibZipSharp`](https://github.com/xamarin/LibZipSharp/)) or the 7z SDK supporting all of the additional compression algorithms.  If support for them (`lzma` or `bzip2`) would be added to NuGet, the system would remain compatible with the existing nuget compression but would allow for creation of new nugets which\r\nuse the other compression schemes, benefiting users as far as download times and disk space are concerned.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"21023464597","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-30T16:57:46","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11705","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Disable NuGet.CommandLine.Test.NuGetPushCommandTest.PushCommand_PushToServer_WhenPluginReturnsNoCredentials_FallBackToConsoleProvider\" (#11705) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"21023445437","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-30T16:56:42","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11704","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet.CommandLine.Test.NuGetPushCommandTest.PushCommand_PushToServer_WhenPluginReturnsNoCredentials_FallBackToConsoleProvider is flaky\" (#11704) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"It has about 50% failure rate."},{"Id":"21019203397","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-30T13:42:56","Actor":"v-luzh","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11703","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: A prompt error “cannot access disposed object” prevents solution saving after installing a package from local path\" (#11703) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\nDev\\6.2.0.132\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\n### Details about Problem\r\nVS Version: Main\\32329.175\r\nNuGet Version: Dev\\6.2.0.132\r\nOS Version: Windows-11-Enterprise-21H2\r\n\r\n### Repro steps:\r\n1.Only enable one package source which point to local path (have some packages) in the Options->NuGet Package Manager->Package Sources.\r\n2.Create a C# Console App (.NET Core 6.0) project in VS.\r\n3.Right-Click the project in the Solution Explorer window, select ‘Manage NuGet Packages…’ and select the package source (which I set in step1) in the Package source drop-down box.\r\n4.Click “Browse” tab and install a package from the local path.\r\n5.Save the solution and close VS.\r\n\r\n### Expected:\r\nThe solution can be saved and closed successfully.\r\n\r\n### Actual:\r\nA prompt error “cannot access disposed object” prevents solution saving after installing a package from local path as below.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20632625/160847414-e8cc9efa-e410-4a29-9a87-9b672aa87f38.png)\r\n### Notes:\r\n1.It reproes on .NET SDK style projects, does not repro on .NET Framework projects.\r\n2.It just repro on local path packages, dose not repro on online package source (e.g. nuget.org).\r\n3.It start to repro from Dev\\6.2.0.132, doesn't repro on Dev\\6.2.0.131.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"20398585964","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T18:32:01","Actor":"clairernovotny","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/61","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Requiring two-factor authentication on NuGet.org\" (#61) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced plans to require tFA on all accounts on NuGet.org.

It's challenging for users to quickly identify packages that are not actively maintained or updated.\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nNuGet.org could enforce a policy that ensures package authors keep their packages up to date. If a newer version has not been published for a certain period, NuGet.org could:\r\n- Display a visual indicator on NuGet.org to highlight outdated packages.\r\n- Notify package owners so they can take appropriate action.\r\n- Implement a protocol change allowing NuGet.Client to display this information for package consumers.\r\n\r\nThis proposal complements the existing [package quality score](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/package-scoring-v1/proposed/2022/package-scoring-v1.md#maintenance) spec by adding mechanisms to further improve package maintenance and transparency.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nKeeping NuGet packages up to date is crucial for maintaining security, reliability, and performance. Developers need a clear indication of which packages are being actively maintained and which are outdated. By implementing these features, NuGet.org would help developers make informed decisions and encourage package maintainers to provide timely updates, improving the overall health of the ecosystem."},{"Id":"42415672476","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-09-30T23:47:16","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10194","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"FI main to dev\" (#10194) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"42487001831","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-02T20:05:22","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13832","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Unable to build NuGet.Client VSIX - \"GetDeploymentPathFromVsixManifest\" task failed unexpectedly\" (#13832) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I'm not able to build the NuGet.Client VSIX with the latest 17.12 Preview 3 Visual Studio Internal Preview. \r\n\r\n> The \"GetDeploymentPathFromVsixManifest\" task failed unexpectedly.\r\n> System.AggregateException->Microsoft.Build.Framework.BuildException.GenericBuildTransferredException: One or more errors occurred. ---> Microsoft.Build.Framework.BuildException.GenericBuildTransferredException:\r\n> Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n>    --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\r\n\r\nWhat I've tracked down is that we target a very old 17.0.x version of Microsoft.VSSDK.BuildTools https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/db35f736d692fe4a46357a3a2de1ea6206dddeb3/Directory.Packages.props#L79\r\n\r\nLikely there's some breaking change that's occurred between 17.0 and 17.12."},{"Id":"42478023654","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-02T15:09:00","Actor":"DocCoCauBai-00","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13831","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"I cannot run Windows PowerShell as an administrator.\" (#13831) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nOther/NA\n\n### Product Version\n\nwindows powershell v1\n\n### Worked before?\n\nv1\n\n### Impact\n\nOther\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nWindows PowerShell terminated with the following error:\r\n The type initializer for 'System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.InitialSessionState' threw an exception.\r\n\r\n[process exited with code 4294901760 (0xffff0000)]\r\nYou can now close this terminal with Ctrl+D, or press Enter to restart.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\nWindows PowerShell terminated with the following error:\r\n The type initializer for 'System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.InitialSessionState' threw an exception.\r\n\r\n[process exited with code 4294901760 (0xffff0000)]\r\nYou can now close this terminal with Ctrl+D, or press Enter to restart.\n```\n"},{"Id":"42453609578","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T21:58:47","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13778","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Detect if restore used NuGetAudit or not for PackageReference projects\" (#13778) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\r\n\r\nMSBuild.exe, dotnet.exe\r\n\r\n### The Elevator Pitch\r\n\r\nEngineering teams responsible for CI build compliance may want to enforce that NuGetAudit runs during restore.

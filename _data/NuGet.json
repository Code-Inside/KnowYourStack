If the last time I used package manager I left my tab on for example \"installed\" it would be the tab that the analyzer would open and try to search for the missing package. This would show no results.\n\nBut obviously it should have switched to \"Browser\" since the package was not in my solution.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 10/14/2020, 03:31 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

A fix would be nice\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nMy package [WTelegramClient 4.0.0-dev.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WTelegramClient/4.0.0-dev.5#dependencies-body-tab) shows a dependency upon a package named MTProtoGenerator (source generator)\r\n\r\nBut:\r\n- that source generator is purely internal and used for compiling, isn't required by developers using my library\r\n- that source generator is referenced in csproj as a relative **ProjectReference OutputItemType=\"Analyzer\"** not **PackageReference** so it was never intended to appear as a public dependency\r\n\r\nNow the source of the problem may come from the fact that during the build of 4.0.0-dev.3, my build.yml process made the mistake to **nuget push MTProtoGenerator** that version as an independent package, instead of **nuget push WTelegramClient**.\r\nThis past error resulted in that package [MTProtoGenerator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MTProtoGenerator/) 4.0.0-dev.3 appearing on Nuget, and **I promptly requested to delete it.**\r\n\r\nBut apparently:\r\n- not all references to that package are deleted, as that page is still somewhat accessible https://www.nuget.org/packages/MTProtoGenerator/\r\n- every new build of WTelegramClient still show reference upon the supposedly public nuget package MTProtoGenerator (with non-existing versions), even though it should remain purely internal.\r\n\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nGo to https://www.nuget.org/packages/WTelegramClient/4.0.0-dev.5#dependencies-body-tab and see the wrong reference\r\nClick on the reference to see that page https://www.nuget.org/packages/MTProtoGenerator/ doesn't list any such package or matching versions.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMTProtoGenerator shouldn't be listed in the dependencies tabs, as it's an internal source generator that shouldn't have been pushed to Nuget, has been deleted, and isn't pushed anymore since that erroneous older version\n\n###

Additional Context and logs\n\nFor reference, my csproj is here: https://github.com/wiz0u/WTelegramClient/blob/master/src/WTelegramClient.csproj\r\nAnd the erroneous \"push\" build logs is here:

since)\r\n"},{"Id":"37104825896","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-04-02T22:28:20","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9898","RelatedDescription":"Closed

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet. Packaging versions). If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET SDKs.\r\n\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.8.0 or lower, you should download and install 6.8.1 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.8.1/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.7.0 or lower, you should download and install 6.7.1 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.7.1/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.6.1 or lower, you should download and install 6.6.2 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.6.2/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.4.2 or lower, you should download and install 6.4.3 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.4.3/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.3.3 or lower, you should download and install 6.3.4 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.3.4/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.0.5 or lower, you should download and install 6.0.6 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.0.6/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 5.11.5 or lower, you should download and install 5.11.6 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v5.11.6/nuget.exe.\r\n\r\nYou can get the version of NuGet.exe by running the `nuget` command. You should see an output like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNuGet Version: 6.0.0.280\r\n\r\nusage: NuGet <command> [args] [options]\r\n\r\nType 'NuGet help <command>' for help on a specific command.\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n\r\n  https://www.nuget.org/downloads\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command.

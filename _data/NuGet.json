When this is set to `false`, we filter packages only by their asset frameworks, and only show asset framework badges. When this is set to `true`, we filter packages by asset frameworks + computed frameworks, and we show both types of badges as well.\r\n- **Framework Filter Mode**\r\n     Toggle that chooses between `All` and `Any` (default is `All`). This affects cases when multiple framework or TFM filters are selected. When this is set to `All`, we will show packages matching **all** the framework and TFM filters. If it is set to `Any`, we will show packages matching **any one of** the selected filters.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/82980589/f7fb58e7-95f8-4200-aaa4-40af73fff1bf)\r\n\r\nThe changes are behind a feature flag.\r\n\r\nI ran Accessibility FastPass, and it didn't throw up any issues. I also checked color contrast for the new UI elements.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** I made an additional bug fix for the TFM badges in this PR. The TFM badges link to the frameworks tab on the package details page, but we weren't providing a package version, so the links sometimes took us to the wrong version's page. I've now fixed that.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Demos\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Before vs. after </summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/82980589/06799f14-fbce-43d9-80ca-10ba068d0ce2)\r\nvs. (see top of the Frameworks filter section on the left)\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/82980589/9350ef7d-ed72-45c7-b519-adfb90d8b237)\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n<details><summary>Include computed frameworks demo </summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/82980589/285752c9-eb6a-4609-ba9e-e225bbd18039\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n<details><summary>Framework filter mode demo </summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/82980589/08d0f892-ae5b-42f7-8917-92a9024bc0bb\r\n\r\nInfo tooltip:\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/82980589/d6841353-af3a-4c72-9c42-81d0dede62b6)\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n<details><summary>Narrow/mobile screens </summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/82980589/aface9ca-e8c7-4348-a42d-5a7eb093de8a)\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"35454732605","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-02-06T18:10:23","Actor":"lyndaidaii","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9797","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens fix vulnerability.\" (#9797) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Summary of the changes (in less than 80 characters):\r\n\r\nAddresses https://github.com/NuGet/Engineering/issues/5237"},{"Id":"35430123879","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-02-06T03:51:32","Actor":"advay26","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9796","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"TFM Badges: Fixed focus underline and outline + Added missing tooltip\" (#9796) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Addresses https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9795\r\n\r\nThis fixes:\r\n\r\n1.

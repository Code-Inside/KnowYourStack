I've been chasing this for days now through every channel I can.  Starting about 3 days ago, I (and several others who have reported this issue on the Visual Studio support forums) started having issues updating assemblies using Visual Studio 2022.  dotnet and nuget from the command line are also failing.  Trying to download nupkg files manually succeeds but is very slow.  When I run \"curl https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/sixlabors.imagesharp/2.1.8/sixlabors.imagesharp.2.1.8.nupkg -o junk\" on Windows from Command Prompt or Powershell the download goes very slow or hangs altogether.  However, under WSL *on the same machine*, it works and it's instant.  dotnet and nuget also work under WSL.  When I run the exact same command from WSL *on the same machine*, it downloads instantly (it's something like 100x faster).  The issue occurs with all the nupkg files I've tried.  I've reproduced this on three separate windows machines.  Two are Windows 11 and have the latest patches.  One is Windows 10 and hasn't been turned on for months until today to test this issue.  Other websites appear to be fine.  Other download methods are also slow (tried multiple browsers as well).  Disabling the firewall and/or Microsoft Defender has no effect.  See attached verbose logs: there appears to be some kind of incompatibility with the encryption currently in use on nuget.org and Windows schannel.dll (even older versions of schannel.dll--so unless you intended to break compatibility with Windows 10 machines, this is your issue, not the Windows team).\r\n\r\nDid nuget.org change something with its TLS configuration in the past week or so that could be causing this?  It's completely halting work for a *lot* of people.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\n>curl https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/sixlabors.imagesharp/2.1.8/sixlabors.imagesharp.2.1.8.nupkg -o junk -A curl/1.0 -v\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0*   Trying 13.107.246.66:443...\r\n* Connected to api.nuget.org (13.107.246.66) port 443\r\n* schannel: disabled automatic use of client certificate\r\n* ALPN: curl offers http/1.1\r\n* ALPN: server accepted http/1.1\r\n* using HTTP/1.1\r\n> GET /v3-flatcontainer/sixlabors.imagesharp/2.1.8/sixlabors.imagesharp.2.1.8.nupkg HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: api.nuget.org\r\n> User-Agent: curl/1.0\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n>\r\n* schannel: remote party requests renegotiation\r\n* schannel: renegotiating SSL/TLS connection\r\n* schannel: SSL/TLS connection renegotiated\r\n* schannel: remote party requests renegotiation\r\n* schannel: renegotiating SSL/TLS connection\r\n* schannel: SSL/TLS connection renegotiated\r\n* schannel: failed to decrypt data, need more data\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Date: Fri, 26 Apr 2024 01:23:36 GMT\r\n< Content-Type: application/octet-stream\r\n< Content-Length: 4522752\r\n< Connection: keep-alive\r\n< Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400\r\n< Last-Modified: Thu, 11 Apr 2024 06:31:50 GMT\r\n< ETag: 0x8DC59F1121A2751\r\n< x-ms-request-id: 18d4f9e7-301e-0036-50bc-963087000000\r\n< x-ms-version: 2009-09-19\r\n< x-ms-meta-da7b2905_0f3c_4262_921c_b1593d1336f1_ESRP_RequestId: dc4ac97b-1b2e-46cf-abfd-c25a9e3d9165\r\n< x-ms-meta-SHA512: uAybk5N8IxYppIRr07gglVh4Un1dCW4KhxQdrpWDBONRVFZTNAFpwTkh5NTVxyKPC4Akvm6jriyzGXTUu6NQqA==\r\n< x-ms-lease-status: unlocked\r\n< x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob\r\n< Access-Control-Expose-Headers: x-ms-request-id,Server,x-ms-version,x-ms-meta-da7b2905_0f3c_4262_921c_b1593d1336f1_ESRP_RequestId,x-ms-meta-SHA512,Content-Type,Cache-Control,Last-Modified,ETag,x-ms-lease-status,x-ms-blob-type,Content-Length,Date,Transfer-Encoding\r\n< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\n< x-azure-ref: 20240426T012336Z-15c97c8cdddz4g8pk6sd5xqgpc00000008cg00000000n7q1\r\n< x-fd-int-roxy-purgeid: 43765298\r\n< X-Cache: TCP_HIT\r\n< X-Cache-Info: L1_T2\r\n< Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000;

A fix would be nice\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\n**Repro steps:**\r\n(I've reproed this within Visual Studio 2022 and from command line, simplified instructions here are from Visual Studio 2022)\r\n1. Create a new C# library project (WithWindows) in Visual Studio 2022.  Set the contents of the csproj file to:\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>net472;net8.0</TargetFrameworks>\r\n    <TargetPlatformIdentifier>Windows</TargetPlatformIdentifier>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n2. Create a second C# library project (ConsumerWithoutWindows) in the same sln.\r\n3. Add a project reference from ConsumerWithoutWindows to consume WithWindows\r\nIts project file will look like this:\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\WithWindows\\WithWindows.csproj\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n5. Build the project\r\n\r\n**Actual Result:**\r\n```\r\nWarning\tNU1702\tProjectReference 'C:\\Repos\\WithWindows\\WithWindows.csproj' was resolved using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2' instead of the project target framework '.NETCoreApp,Version=v8.0'. This project may not be fully compatible with your project.\tConsumerWithoutWindows\tC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\amd64\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets\t1867\t\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Result:**\r\nI would expect an error to help me realize that because my first project is limited to    <TargetPlatformIdentifier>Windows</TargetPlatformIdentifier> that my consuming project would need to be as well.  It's really unclear as a user why this would fall back to net472.\r\n\r\n**More Details:**\r\nIf I remove the net472 target from the WithWindows project, I get the slightly more helpful:\r\n```\r\nError\t\tProject '..\\WithWindows\\WithWindows.csproj' targets 'net8.0'.

I've been chasing this for days now through every channel I can.  Starting about 3 days ago, I (and several others who have reported this issue on the Visual Studio support forums) started having issues updating assemblies using Visual Studio 2022.  dotnet and nuget from the command line are also failing.  Trying to download nupkg files manually succeeds but is very slow.  When I run \"curl https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/sixlabors.imagesharp/2.1.8/sixlabors.imagesharp.2.1.8.nupkg -o junk\" on Windows from Command Prompt or Powershell the download goes very slow or hangs altogether.  However, under WSL *on the same machine*, it works and it's instant.  dotnet and nuget also work under WSL.  When I run the exact same command from WSL *on the same machine*, it downloads instantly (it's something like 100x faster).  The issue occurs with all the nupkg files I've tried.  I've reproduced this on three separate windows machines.  Two are Windows 11 and have the latest patches.  One is Windows 10 and hasn't been turned on for months until today to test this issue.  Other websites appear to be fine.  Other download methods are also slow (tried multiple browsers as well).  Disabling the firewall and/or Microsoft Defender has no effect.  See attached verbose logs: there appears to be some kind of incompatibility with the encryption currently in use on nuget.org and Windows schannel.dll (even older versions of schannel.dll--so unless you intended to break compatibility with Windows 10 machines, this is your issue, not the Windows team).\r\n\r\nDid nuget.org change something with its TLS configuration in the past week or so that could be causing this?  It's completely halting work for a *lot* of people.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\n>curl https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/sixlabors.imagesharp/2.1.8/sixlabors.imagesharp.2.1.8.nupkg -o junk -A curl/1.0 -v\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0*   Trying 13.107.246.66:443...\r\n* Connected to api.nuget.org (13.107.246.66) port 443\r\n* schannel: disabled automatic use of client certificate\r\n* ALPN: curl offers http/1.1\r\n* ALPN: server accepted http/1.1\r\n* using HTTP/1.1\r\n> GET /v3-flatcontainer/sixlabors.imagesharp/2.1.8/sixlabors.imagesharp.2.1.8.nupkg HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: api.nuget.org\r\n> User-Agent: curl/1.0\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n>\r\n* schannel: remote party requests renegotiation\r\n* schannel: renegotiating SSL/TLS connection\r\n* schannel: SSL/TLS connection renegotiated\r\n* schannel: remote party requests renegotiation\r\n* schannel: renegotiating SSL/TLS connection\r\n* schannel: SSL/TLS connection renegotiated\r\n* schannel: failed to decrypt data, need more data\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Date: Fri, 26 Apr 2024 01:23:36 GMT\r\n< Content-Type: application/octet-stream\r\n< Content-Length: 4522752\r\n< Connection: keep-alive\r\n< Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400\r\n< Last-Modified: Thu, 11 Apr 2024 06:31:50 GMT\r\n< ETag: 0x8DC59F1121A2751\r\n< x-ms-request-id: 18d4f9e7-301e-0036-50bc-963087000000\r\n< x-ms-version: 2009-09-19\r\n< x-ms-meta-da7b2905_0f3c_4262_921c_b1593d1336f1_ESRP_RequestId: dc4ac97b-1b2e-46cf-abfd-c25a9e3d9165\r\n< x-ms-meta-SHA512: uAybk5N8IxYppIRr07gglVh4Un1dCW4KhxQdrpWDBONRVFZTNAFpwTkh5NTVxyKPC4Akvm6jriyzGXTUu6NQqA==\r\n< x-ms-lease-status: unlocked\r\n< x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob\r\n< Access-Control-Expose-Headers: x-ms-request-id,Server,x-ms-version,x-ms-meta-da7b2905_0f3c_4262_921c_b1593d1336f1_ESRP_RequestId,x-ms-meta-SHA512,Content-Type,Cache-Control,Last-Modified,ETag,x-ms-lease-status,x-ms-blob-type,Content-Length,Date,Transfer-Encoding\r\n< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\n< x-azure-ref: 20240426T012336Z-15c97c8cdddz4g8pk6sd5xqgpc00000008cg00000000n7q1\r\n< x-fd-int-roxy-purgeid: 43765298\r\n< X-Cache: TCP_HIT\r\n< X-Cache-Info: L1_T2\r\n< Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000;

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.

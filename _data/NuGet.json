author primary signature validity period has expired.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Debian Versions](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\r\n- We're currently aware that Debian 10 (\"buster\") and earlier versions are affected. ❌\r\n- We do know that Debian testing (\"bullseye\") and later are not affected. ✔\r\n\r\nThis is because of an [issue reported](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=962596) in the `ca-certificates` package in which the root CA being used are not trusted and must be installed manually due to [Symantec Issues](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Symantec_Issues). Because this issue has been resolved recently in version 20210119 of this package, it is not available in a Debian version as provided in `dotnet-docker` for `buster-slim` today.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\n- Manually update the [ca-certificates](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/ca-certificates) package to version 20210119 including a `bullseye` or later version.\r\n- Consider using a different Debian-based Docker image such as `alpine` or `focal`.\r\n \r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nWe're currently working to update the `dotnet-docker`'s `buster-slim` image to update the `ca-certificates` package to 20210119 that resolves this issue. We are however currently verifying this is a viable solution with no large diffs between the `buster` and `bullseye` releases.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `ca-certificates` package is due to be installed in the Debian FTP archive which will promote this fix to the `buster` release in the next few days to which an updated `buster-slim` image will be prepared and released when available.\r\n\r\n## Stay Updated\r\n\r\n- We are continuing to investigate this issue and will let you know more as we find out.\r\n- We'll continue to update the discussion at https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10491.\r\n- We will also continue posting updates on https://status.nuget.org and on Twitter @NuGet."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1355252975678189569","CreatedAt":"2021-01-29T20:34:23+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"For users affected by the Debian 10 Buster CA Certificate issue, we now have a documented mitigation available.\n\nPl… https://t.co/VhGXtYI6aj","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":12,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1354633996202700808","CreatedAt":"2021-01-28T03:34:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"📢 For .NET Docker users, we have published new images that mitigate these issues by using a pre-release version of… https://t.co/eWBiUMyYhr","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":41,"FavoriteCount":26,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1354552703150649351","CreatedAt":"2021-01-27T22:11:45+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Please see our official announcement for our latest understanding of the root cause of this issue and recommended w… https://t.co/zAQswryI8d","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":7,"FavoriteCount":4,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1354464163653890051","CreatedAt":"2021-01-27T16:19:55+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"(1/2) Here's what we've gathered to far:\n\n.NET 5 restore appears to be broken on some operating systems resulting i… https://t.co/KFwSxsi2rY","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":20,"FavoriteCount":12,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1354455557541933056","CreatedAt":"2021-01-27T15:45:44+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"⚠ Degradation notification ⚠\n\nSignature verification for Microsoft packages is failing in some scenarios due to a c… https://t.co/EisS5l9A3o","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":43,"FavoriteCount":24,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1349825493265231872","CreatedAt":"2021-01-14T21:07:30+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone! 🥳🥳🥳\n\nThank you to all of the team members (past and present), external con… https://t.co/mWYE55Bh9b","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":20,"FavoriteCount":4,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1334226716139655171","CreatedAt":"2020-12-02T20:03:32+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"⚠ Deprecation notice ⚠\n\nHave you recently experienced issues with your NuGet connectors?

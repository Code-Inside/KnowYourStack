are affected. ❌\r\n- We do know that Debian testing (\"bullseye\") and later are not affected. ✔\r\n\r\nThis is because of an [issue reported](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=962596) in the `ca-certificates` package in which the root CA being used are not trusted and must be installed manually due to [Symantec Issues](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Symantec_Issues). Because this issue has been resolved recently in version 20210119 of this package, it is not available in a Debian version as provided in `dotnet-docker` for `buster-slim` today.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\n- Manually update the [ca-certificates](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/ca-certificates) package to version 20210119 including a `bullseye` or later version.\r\n- Consider using a different Debian-based Docker image such as `alpine` or `focal`.\r\n \r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nWe're currently working to update the `dotnet-docker`'s `buster-slim` image to update the `ca-certificates` package to 20210119 that resolves this issue. We are however currently verifying this is a viable solution with no large diffs between the `buster` and `bullseye` releases.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `ca-certificates` package is due to be installed in the Debian FTP archive which will promote this fix to the `buster` release in the next few days to which an updated `buster-slim` image will be prepared and released when available.\r\n\r\n## Stay Updated\r\n\r\n- We are continuing to investigate this issue and will let you know more as we find out.\r\n- We'll continue to update the discussion at https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10491.\r\n- We will also continue posting updates on https://status.nuget.org and on Twitter @NuGet."},{"Id":"14085142486","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-05T00:13:18","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/48","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"November dry run for custom V2 OData query deprecation\" (#48) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"\r\nWe announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/37) last year and we will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in **February 2021**. \r\n\r\nWe will conduct **a dry run of the OData deprecation** to ensure that there are no surprises for users, which is scheduled to ensure overlap with normal working hours across the globe.

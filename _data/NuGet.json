This follows Visual Studio's version numbers, but 11.0 versions behind. For example, NuGet 6.0 shipped in Visual Studio 2012 17.0. NuGet 5.11 shipped in Visual Studio 2019 16.11.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the assemblies matched the build number, just like the rest of NuGet's assemblies. In other words, in build 6.0.0.280, all assemblies had the version 6.0.0.280. In NuGet build 5.11.0.10 has assembly version 5.11.0.10.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nThe package version for the Visual Studio extensibility APIs should match the version (at least the major and minor version) of Visual Studio that those APIs are available in. For example, the package version for NuGet APIs that are available in dev 17.1 should be package version 17.1.x\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the assembly version for all builds in the same Major.Minor.Patch should use the same assembly version, to avoid binding redirect issues, similar to how Newtonsoft.Json use the same assembly version for all packages with the same major version.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nNuGet.VisualStudio 6.0.0 did not work when Visual Studio 2022 17.0 was first released, for reasons explained in this issue: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11367.\r\n\r\nWhile the primary goal is to ensure this type of error can never happen again, we can take the opportunity to reduce confusion about which version of NuGet's APIs should be used in which version of Visual Studio."},{"Id":"18919815049","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-16T23:27:06","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11393","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add NuGet SDK and other options to affected product in issue templates\" (#11393) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"The issue templates force everyone to choose a product, but not all issues are related to the options available.

But if you open solution in (fresh instance of) VS2019, right-click project and select Build -- it produces this in Build output window:\r\n```\r\n1>------ Build started: Project: CommonLib, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\r\nNuGet package restore failed. Please see Error List window for detailed warnings and errors.\r\n...\r\n```\r\nand build fails (sometimes not) due to missing header files/etc (that are located in referenced package). Package itself is already restored and sits in `%home%\\.nuget\\packages`.\r\n\r\nRunning with detailed build output produces:\r\n```\r\nBuild started...\r\n1>------ Up-To-Date check: Project: Common\\CommonLib\\CommonLib.vcxproj, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\r\n1>Project is not up-to-date: last build was unsuccessful.\r\n1>------ Build started: Project: CommonLib, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\r\nNuGet package restore failed. Please see Error List window for detailed warnings and errors.\r\nError occurred while restoring NuGet packages: NuGet.PackageManagement.VisualStudio.Exceptions.ProjectNotNominatedException: The operation failed as details for project CommonLib could not be loaded.\r\n   at NuGet.PackageManagement.VisualStudio.CpsPackageReferenceProject.GetPackageSpecsAndAdditionalMessagesAsync(DependencyGraphCacheContext context)\r\n   at NuGet.PackageManagement.DependencyGraphRestoreUtility.<GetSolutionRestoreSpecAndAdditionalMessages>d__10.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.SolutionRestoreJob.<RestorePackageSpecProjectsAsync>d__24.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ValidateEnd(Task task)\r\n   at NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.SolutionRestoreJob.<RestoreAsync>d__22.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\r\n   at NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.SolutionRestoreJob.<RestoreAsync>d__22.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.SolutionRestoreJob.<ExecuteAsync>d__21.MoveNext()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich points to [this line](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/b9aa71007af196b4474dbf05bc66e9ed4cda0bcc/src/NuGet.Clients/NuGet.PackageManagement.VisualStudio/Projects/CpsPackageReferenceProject.cs#L133) -- it looks like NuGet maintains some sort of cache with project-related info and at this point it is expected that cache is already populated. I also noticed that this function uses project full path (while few other places use project full name) as a lookup key. It is my first time looking at NuGet source code, so I can't really comment on what is going on.\r\n\r\nIn cases when error message is generated and build fails detailed logs has this line buried in the output:\r\n```\r\n1>Target \"ResolveNuGetPackageAssets\" skipped, due to false condition; ('$(ResolveNuGetPackages)' == 'true' and exists('$(ProjectLockFile)')) was evaluated as ('true' == 'true' and exists('obj\\project.assets.json')).\r\n```\r\nwhich suggests that at this stage `project.assets.json` was not created at that moment yet. Rerunning build works fine (no message and build succeeds).\r\n\r\nThere seem to be some race condition somewhere because there are basically three possible behaviors:\r\n- all works fine\r\n- `NuGet package restore failed` message and build works fine\r\n- `NuGet package restore failed` message and build fails (usually after I do Clean, restart VS and click Build again)\r\n\r\nI am pushing the envelope here since C++ projects do not officially support _PackageReference_. I don't expect a bugfix, but I am hoping there is a workaround for this problem -- maybe there is a directive to add to .vcxproj that will ensure package restore stage is delayed until `_projectSystemCache` is populated?\r\n\r\nMaybe an MSBuild construct that will create a dependency between certain tasks that will guarantee population of said cache before it is used?\r\n\r\n(if I click `Restore NuGet Packages` before building my project -- all works fine)\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"18916333959","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-16T19:10:40","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11391","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Central Package Management - Transitive Pinning\" (#11391) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"This document contains the behaviors known today of the central package management's transitive pinning feature & has a few questions/proposal that we would love to get your feedback on.

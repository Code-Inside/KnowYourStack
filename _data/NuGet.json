For various reasons, while the main 3rd party NuGet package is listed on Nuget.org, its dependency is delisted.\nBoth of those packages have been added as entries into the packages.config file.\nAs we don't want either of those to be automatically updated, we have added the allowedVersions attribute to restrict those items to the currently installed version.\n\nHowever, now when we run our CI build, the call to update the referenced packages fails with an error of: \"Unable to find package 'Xxxx'. Existing packages must be restored before performing an install or update.\", where Xxxx is referencing the delisted NuGet package, and none of the packages referenced by that packages.config file get updated.\nAs mentioned above, our pipeline has already performed a restore operation, and the problematic package should not be being updated.\n\nAs far as I can see this just makes the \"nuget.exe update\" command useless.\n\nIt's fair enough that is doesn't update the delisted package, or any package that has that as a dependency. The issue is that it fails to update all other packages that could be updated, especially after taking into account the allowedVersions attribute\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 2/25/2024, 11:59 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)"},{"Id":"36144685393","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-03-01T00:09:01","Actor":"Nigusu-Allehu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13276","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Running \"nuget.exe update packages.config\" fails if packages.config references a delisted project\" (#13276) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\nNuGet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nGitHub issue for https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_dashboards/dashboard/626b3742-3c63-4ade-8e3d-43e2c461f222 \n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nContinue updating other packages\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"36142922009","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-02-29T22:30:34","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13271","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Display a vulnerability info bar when there's vulnerabilities in packages.config based projects.\" (#13271) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"36142571764","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-02-29T22:15:04","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5195","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How can I prevent FolderNugetProject using global packages folder\" (#5195) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I'm using FolderNugetProject class and I would like to stop nuget also keeping a copy in .nuget directory.\r\n\r\nIs this possible?\r\n"},{"Id":"36134505583","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-02-29T17:10:48","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Address nullability suppressions in NuGet.VisualStudio.Internal.Contracts\" (#13179) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"See: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/5582#discussion_r1460633179"},{"Id":"36134009701","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-02-29T16:55:34","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9041","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Restore:  excessive deep cloning of ProjectSpec\" (#9041) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"When restoring ([`NuGet.Commands.RestoreRunner.RunAsync(...)`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/74d1935e4e25a90df536ae7cac6cf7c73c6ea678/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/RestoreCommand/RestoreRunner.cs#L25)) NuGet makes wasteful use of memory with respect to `PackageSpec` objects.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.

These additional implementations come from the `add-ins` directory via MEF, much like existing shims.\r\n\r\nThe flow of validation BEFORE the change is like this:\r\n1. Parse the JWT\r\n2. Identify the issuer\r\n3. Perform an OSS issuer-specific validation, such as [`EntraIdTokenValidator`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/7c81548db51ed543ff8f6558c1306571a6bb368a/src/NuGetGallery.Services/Authentication/Federated/EntraIdTokenValidator.cs)\r\n4. If the issuer says the token is good, then compare it to the given list of trust policies.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new step between 3 and 4 where the request headers (in particular the `Authorization` header) is passed to each `IFederatedCredentialValidator` to get additional token validation results. If either the built-in token validation or any additional `IFederatedCredentialValidator` says the token is bad, it will be rejected. \r\n\r\nWe pass all request headers, the detected issuer type (e.g. Entra ID vs. GitHub Actions), and _unvalidated_ claims to the `IFederatedCredentialValidator`. This essentially provides all the context we have to the shim at the time so it can make the most informed decision.\r\n\r\nAt no point will as \"valid\" result from an `IFederatedCredentialValidator` override a \"bad\" result from the built-in token validation. In other words, if there is an inconsistency between various validation flows, we fail close and reject the token. We will log a warning if any of the validators disagree on valid vs. invalid.\r\n\r\nA `IFederatedCredentialValidator` can return `NotApplicable` if the validator is only meant for a specific issuer. For example, `IFederatedCredentialValidator` might only know how to validate GitHub Actions tokens, not Entra ID tokens. The GitHub Actions example is for the future of course. Right now, the only supported issuer is Entra ID.\r\n\r\nI chose to plumb the request headers in from the service layer (and eventually from the controller action) instead of using the current `HttpContext` so that the flow of data was clearer. I would have preferred to only provide the bearer token to `IFederatedCredentialValidator` instead of all headers, but our internal token validation library expects all request headers, not just the bearer token.\r\n\r\nOur internal token validation shim uses a newer version of Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory so I had to bump up the version to avoid runtime issues."},{"Id":"45042422735","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-12-23T17:48:21","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10305","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[OIDC 15] Emit audit records during token exchange and policy admin\" (#10305) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Progress on https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10212.\r\nDepends on https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10304.\r\n\r\nThis builds on a previous PR to actually emit new audit records from various \"write\" flows used in the OIDC feature.

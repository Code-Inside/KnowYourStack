A fix would be nice\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\n#### Repro Steps: \r\n1.\tCreate a solution with two C# Console App (.NET 8.0) projects (called Project1 and Project2), right-click the solution in the Solution Explorer window and select the menu item “Manage NuGet Packages for Solution…”..\r\n2.\tGo to ‘Browse’ tab, install the package **‘jQuery 3.5.0’** into **Project1** and install the package **‘jQuery 3.6.0’** into **Project2**.\r\n3.\tIn the right panel, select the ‘3.5.0’ in the drop-down list of ‘Version’ box and click the alternate package link ‘jQuery>=3.5.0.1’.\r\n4.\tDon’t delete the searching string “packageid:[PackageName]” in the filter and click the ‘Installed’/’Updates’/’Consolidate’ tab.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results:\r\nThe searching mode “packageid:[PackageName]” should also be supported in the filter of ‘Installed’/’Updates’/’Consolidate’ tab. There should be the package ‘jQuery’ listed in ‘Installed’/’Updates’/’Consolidate’ tab in this instance.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Result:\r\nThe searching mode “packageid:[PackageName]” is not supported in the filter of ‘Installed’/’Updates’/’Consolidate’ tab as below screenshot. It doesn’t make sense because the searching mode “packageid:[PackageName]” is supported in ‘Browse’ tab.\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/assets/20632625/0c41df51-5659-4755-b41b-dc223ba2a2ec)\r\n\r\n#### Notes:\r\nRepro Rate: 100%\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"39239596468","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T17:11:14","Actor":"drobert-bfm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13541","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"\"An item with the same key has already been added.\" thrown with version 6.10 of nuget\" (#13541) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nNuGet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nNuGet Version: 6.10.0.107\n\n### Worked before?\n\n6.5.0\n\n### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use this version\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nnuget restore <file>.sln -verbosity detailed\r\n\r\nGet error:\r\nAn item with the same key has already been added.\r\nSystem.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added.\r\n   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentException(ExceptionResource resource)\r\n   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.Insert(TKey key, TValue value, Boolean add)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.RestoreCommand.GetPackagesConfigToProjectPath(PackageRestoreInputs packageRestoreInputs)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.RestoreCommand.<PerformNuGetV2RestoreAsync>d__59.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.RestoreCommand.<ExecuteCommandAsync>d__52.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.Command.Execute()\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.Program.MainCore(String workingDirectory, String[] args)\r\n\r\nWorked fine with version 6.5.

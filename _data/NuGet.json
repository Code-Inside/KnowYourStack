A fix would be nice\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\n1. Create a solution with 2 projects, ProjectA and ProjectB\r\n2. In ProjectA, install a top-level package that depends on one or more transitive package that is vulnerable. For example, Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client version 5.2.9 which depends on Newtonsoft.Json 10.0.1 which is vulnerable\r\n3. Add a project reference from ProjectB -> ProjectA. That is, ProjectB depends on ProjectA.\r\n4. Open the NuGet Package Manager for Project B.\r\n\r\n**Expected:**\r\nThe Installed Tab should not have a warning indicator by it in ProjectB, since it has no packages installed.\r\n\r\n**Actual**\r\nThe Installed Tab has a warning indicator that 3 vulnerable packages are installed (presumably because the dependent project, ProjectA, has 3 transitive vulnerable packages), even though ProjectB has no installed packages:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/Client.Engineering/assets/10777837/2d063c41-e683-4f8b-9982-45f01b064ecd)\r\n\r\nNote: This only seems to happen when there's a project dependency between ProjectB which depends on ProjectA. If there are no project dependencies, the issue does not repro. Also, this only repros if ProjectA has transitive package vulnerabilities. If it has top-level package vulnerabilities only, the issue does not repro.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"32913595856","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-10-28T01:30:54","Actor":"zhhyu","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/63","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Connection] Deprecating legacy cipher suites at www.nuget.org\" (#63) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"In order to provide a more secure and compliant environment for our customers, we are planning to deprecate legacy cipher suites and only support the following cipher suites at [www.nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org/):\r\n\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\r\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\nBetween 08/31/2022 07:00 PM UTC and 09/02/2022 07:00 PM UTC, we will take a test for this deprecation to understand the broken change for our customers.

This was because certain front-ends will reset a connection in certain cases with the assumption that the caller will retry.  However, the current retry logic proved to be too aggressive and would not be able to recover.  This led to this issue being filed: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/55449.\r\n\r\nThe enhanced retry logic was merged here: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4220.  Since the rollout of the feature by customers, its shown to work well.

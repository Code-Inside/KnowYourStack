For instance sub-packages for UWP, Android and iOS. These sub packages deploy various resources like native libraries, shaders etc.\r\n\r\nNext you create your app heads for iOS, Android and UWP, and you reference your .NET Standard project. In turn the NuGet package also gets available for compilation. You can even access the APIs in the package from the project heads. However, the .targets and contents down in the package dependencies are not included, and thus at runtime, your app will crash, because the native libs and resources doesn't get deployed.\r\n\r\nThe workaround currently is to set \"privateAssets=none\" on the nuget reference, but this is very counter intuitive and is going to hurt my customers. They would expect things to \"just work\" when it compiles fine. At no point has my nuget package said to ignore .targets and contents (the dependency list in the nuget package does specify `include=\"all\"` already, but it seems to not actually be doing that).\r\n\r\nThe interesting bit is, this issue doesn't affect UWP, but it affects WPF, iOS and Android.\r\n\r\nEven worse, when using packages.config instead of Package Reference in your project head, you don't get any access to the APIs from the nuget package in the project heads.

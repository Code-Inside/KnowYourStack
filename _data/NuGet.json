issue \"Nuget.Build.Taskss caches CredentialProvider device flow timeout.\" (#12540) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nMSBuild.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nNuget 6.5.0.149 (does not seems to be fixed in recent code yet)\n\n### Worked before?\n\nunknown\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nWe are working on MSBuild server which is concept of long running process which will execute consequent builds so it can effectively reuse memory caches between builds.  People were reporting intermittent inability to use interactive restore.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nRoot cause: Task caches result of timeouted CredentialProvider device flow. Consequent runs do not call CredentialProvider and use cached failure value.\r\n\r\nCache is rooted by: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/3a0c9a47e24642bb4a4465dec7b4d1c379367855/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/HttpSource/HttpHandlerResourceV3.cs#L40\r\n\r\nResult is \"wrongly\" identified as cacheable at line nr 125 bellow:\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/3a0c9a47e24642bb4a4465dec7b4d1c379367855/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Credentials/CredentialService.cs#L106-L129\r\n\r\nThere also seems to to be related bug in CredetionProvider which causes null exception as can be seen in log bellow.\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider/blob/e19f61d6c0697a73fb6b08cd3c9c687f9aa97d36/CredentialProvider.Microsoft/CredentialProviders/Vsts/AdalTokenProvider.cs#L46-L59\r\nConstructor on line 59 fails on null exception when it timeouted because it will pass in null as argument.\r\n\r\n### Repro steps\r\nIt is hard to repro with existing MSBuild as it has some workarounds around this bug.\r\nI do not believe repro is necessary, log and analysis seem to enough to understand root cause of this bug.\r\nHowever if I would need to repro it I would:\r\n\r\n- prepare project which needs interactive restore\r\n- create console app and link it with msbuild.dll\r\n- in that console app hardcore it to build give project twice\r\n- let first project build timeout on sing in requests\r\n- observe second build to fail without sign in prompt\r\n\r\nIf repro is really needed please ping me and I can help with building it or testing it.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\nBellow is related part from msbuild binlog.

This change allows our team flexibility to switch to a back-up provider in the case that one CDN is down, which will broaden coverage for our users.\r\n\r\nSome changes are coming for older TLS cipher suites, which may result in connectivity issues. From our data we believe this will affect only a small percentage of requests. We will be monitoring all feedback channels during the migration to assess impact and adjust our roll-out timeline as needed.\r\n\r\nBelow, we provide resources to determine whether you will be affected by this change. This utilizes the [.NET CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to install a package from our pre-production (INT) environment which tests connectivity:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir cdn-test\r\ncd cdn-test\r\ndotnet new classlib\r\ndotnet add package BaseTestPackage.NetStandard --source https://apiint.nugettest.org/v3/index.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing connectivity issues while connecting to nuget.org or restoring packages from https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json, such as:\r\n\r\n\"The SSL connection could not be established\"\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that TLS 1.2 and any of the following cipher suites have been enabled on your machine:\r\n\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, do reach out to us at support@nuget.org or by commenting on the discussion issue: NuGet/Home#11058"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1631370937248481281","CreatedAt":"2023-03-02T19:08:35+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Your package's README is your chance to showcase your hard work and make a great first impression.

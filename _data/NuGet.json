like  \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<NoWarn>\r\n    NU1702\r\n</NoWarn>\r\n``` \r\nand \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<WarningsAsErrors>\r\n    NU1702;1702\r\n</WarningsAsErrors>\r\n``` \r\n\r\nare ignored by `dotnet build`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Create a solution.\r\n2. Create a `netcoreapp2.0` or a `netcoreapp3.0` project `A`\r\n3. Create a class library targeting `net472` called `B`\r\n4. Edit `A`'s csproj and add to it:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>True</TreatWarningsAsErrors>\r\n    <WarningsAsErrors>NU1702</WarningsAsErrors>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Reference `B` from `A`\r\n6. Compile the solution with `dotnet build`\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nA compilation error. \r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nThe compilation succeeds, with a warning `NU1702`, which is not treated as an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional notes**:\r\n\r\nThe reference from NetCoreApp to .NET 4.7.2 project raises a `NU1702` warning, which should be treated as an error, given the directive:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n    <WarningsAsErrors>NU1702</WarningsAsErrors>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\nI also tried with \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n        <TreatSpecificWarningsAsErrors>NU1702;1702</TreatSpecificWarningsAsErrors>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n        <TreatSpecificWarningsAsErrors>NU1702;1702</TreatSpecificWarningsAsErrors>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\nand even by placing those directives in the `PropertyGroup` node where `<TargetFramework>` is. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible related issues:\r\n\r\n* [Cannot disable NuGet warnings with dotnet 2.0](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5769)\r\n* [TreatSpecificWarningsAsErrors does not work](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/6485)\r\n* [Framework Conditioned warning properties are not respected for multi-targeting projects](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5712)\r\n* [Suppressing warnings through project properties UI adds tfm condition in csproj file for multi targeting project](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2804)\r\n* [Nuget restore build task ignores `NoWarn` usage](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/5494)\r\n\r\n* [TreatSpecificWarningsAsErrors does not work](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/6485)\r\n\r\nI noticed different behaviors depending on:\r\n\r\n* `B` being referenced as a project in the same solution\r\n* `B` being referenced as a NuGet package\r\n* `B` being using the classic csproj file format vs the new SDK csproj format\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"10740159942","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T17:39:29","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/39","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Flag vulnerable packages\" (#39) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec for 'Flagging vulnerable packages' is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|----------|------------------|\r\n|[Flag vulnerable packages](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Flag-vulnerable-packages) | https://github.com/nuget/home/issues/8087|"},{"Id":"10286366828","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-08-26T13:37:09","Actor":"karann-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/38","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"New and improved NuGet Search is live!\" (#38) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Announcing the new and improved search on NuGet.org leveraging Azure Search.\r\n\r\n[Blogpost](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/new-and-improved-nuget-search/) | [Feedback Issue](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4124)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1190360390980395008","CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T20:10:07+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"The issue with the publishing pipeline has been resolved and packages are now being published normally. https://t.co/NdK8mVk7UF","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":3,"FavoriteCount":0,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1190331936293572608","CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T18:17:03+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"We are experiencing an issue with our publishing pipeline causing a delay in the publishing of new packages.

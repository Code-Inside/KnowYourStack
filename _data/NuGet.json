Instead I get a warning that it's incompatible (and can't do anything about it as I otherwise need the file) and also get no outputs providing me with the desired list.\r\n\r\nFurther, there should be some way to write this list directly from the command into the nuget.config file in the root of the directory I'm running the command from.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nAs it stands, I've got too many projects in this solution to try running that command one at a time, so I'm just going to have to pass on fully implementing the package source mapping.

I read from the blog post that precedence rules would be applied for specific values down to wildcards so I thought hey, that's neat. I can specify NuGet as a catch-all and then specify some more specific patterns that also apply to NuGet.  That way if I ever want to change the source, the block is already there and just needs a key change.\r\n\r\nI had tried doing this:\r\n```xml\r\n<packageSourceMapping>\r\n  <packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n    <package pattern=\"**\"/>\r\n  </packageSource>\r\n  <packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n    <package pattern=\"Microsoft.*\"/>\r\n  </packageSource>\r\n</packageSourceMapping>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI saved the file and immediately Visual Studio locked up with the following error:\r\n> NuGet operation failed\r\n> PackageSourceMapping is enabled and there are multiple package sources associated with the same key(s) (and then a path to the file)\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nA gold error bar should show up in Visual Studio calling out the issue, but it absolutely shouldn't require one to crash VS and re-open it due to it being perpetually non-responsive from that moment on. In the alternative, just show a red squiggly in the XML document as though I had a syntax error. Either way, it shouldn't break VS.\r\n\r\nFurther, I think it should allow such an entry. In keeping with the precedence rules indicated, it would simply find a pattern match for the package as before and the key should serve as a reference back to the specific package source, not as a unique identifier for that element.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nToday, it's legal to simply have:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n  <package pattern=\"*\" />\r\n  <package pattern=\"Microsoft.*\"/>\r\n</packageSource>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm simply proposing that this should be legal as well to represent the same thing.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n  <package pattern=\"*\" />\r\n</packageSource>\r\n<packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n  <package pattern=\"Microsoft.*\"/>\r\n</packageSource>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for the consideration!"},{"Id":"32200134984","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-29T12:15:34","Actor":"maxbl4","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12912","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Nuget treats path starting with / as arguments\" (#12912) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nNuGet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.7.0\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use this version\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nI'm using Nuget.Commandline 6.7.0 package to run Nuget on Ubuntu 22 in WSL.\r\nLooks like it treats any argument starting with / as an argument option, so a path starting with / does not work.\r\nE.g.\r\nnuget pack /home/my.nuspec # responds with error: Unknown argument /home/my.nuspec\r\nBut\r\ncd /home\r\nnuget pack my.nuspec # works fine\r\n\r\nConverting all paths to be relative is a big pain\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"32194650544","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-29T08:16:39","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12889","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add nullable annotations to NuGet.LibraryModel\" (#12889) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"[NuGet.LibraryModel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.LibraryModel) is a package that is part of the [NuGet Client SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-client-sdk). We are adding null annotations, so projects using [nullable reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references) will benefit from compiler null checking, leading to improved software reliability (fewer NullReferenceExceptions).\r\n\r\nGenerally when annotating nulls we try to avoid making any breaking API or ABI changes. However, the following changes have been made in order to allow the compiler to provide everyone with the most useful nullable warnings.\r\n\r\nProjects that use this package and enable nullable checks might find that upgrading to a version of the package that now has nullable annotations will generate warnings that previously did not generate warnings. This is a natural consequence of annotating the assembly where it previously lacked annotations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following breaking changes were implemented:\r\n \r\n## Using the `required` modifier on some class properties\r\n\r\nThe following classes are affected: `Library`, `LibraryDependency`, `LibraryIdentity`, `LibraryRange`\r\n\r\n[C#11 introduced the `required` modifier](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/required). It means that projects creating instances of these type will be required to use the [object initializer syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers), and if any property marked as `required` is not assigned a value, the compiler will generate an error. We also provide constructors with all the required properties as constructor parameters. If you are not creating instances of these types, you should be unaffected, even if your project uses lower versions of the C# language.\r\n\r\nWhile my own testing was not exhaustive, it appears that projects targeting lower C# language versions will still provide correct required property compiler checks as long as the compiler supports C#11. Therefore, if your project builds with the latest .NET SDK or Visual Studio (including MSBuild for command line builds), you should be able to use either the object initializer syntax, or a suitable constructor.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're using an older version of Visual Studio, MSBuild, or the .NET SDK (for example, using a *global.json* file to pin to .NET 6 SDK), you will get a compiler error saying the constructor is obsolete when using the default constructor, or any other constructor that does not have a parameter for every required property. In this case, you should use a different constructor overload that the compiler does not consider obsolete.\r\n"},{"Id":"32187193641","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-28T22:40:43","Actor":"meokullu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12911","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Unexpected increase of Updates() when installing prelease packages.\" (#12911) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.7.0.127\n\n### Worked before?\n\nNo\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

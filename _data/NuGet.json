The package is different than the last restore.\" (#11610) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nMSBuild.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nMSBuild 17.1.0+ae57d105c, Visual Studio 17.1.0\n\n### Worked before?\n\nMSBuild 17.0.6, Visual Studio 17.0.6\n\n### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use this version\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nTo clarify, the impact of this issue is that I can not build our UWP app on any version of any tool without removing the lock file, which is prohibitively risky since it may be catching and preventing a live attack on the Microsoft ecosystem.\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n\r\n1. Use Visual Studio 17.1.0 to create a default UWP project with a lock file expecting the following hash for `NETStandard.Library.2.0.3`: `\"st47PosZSHrjECdjeIzZQbzivYBJFv6P2nv4cj2ypdI204DO+vZ7l5raGMiX4eXMJ53RfOIg+/s4DHVZ54Nu2A==\"`. This can be achieved by introducing a direct dependency on [Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform.6.2.13](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform/6.2.13) and adding the following to your `.csproj`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n  <RestoreProjectStyle>PackageReference</RestoreProjectStyle>\r\n  <RestorePackagesWithLockFile>true</RestorePackagesWithLockFile>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will probably then need to modify the hash in the lock file (`packages.lock.json`) to the value provided above.\r\n\r\n2. Build the UWP project in Visual Studio 17.1.0.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\nThe project builds without errors.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\nThe project builds successfully, but reports error NU1403 because of a lock file hash mismatch in `NETStandard.Library.2.0.3`. The error was first observed on February 22nd, 2022 at 18:33 UTC. The same project built successfully without reporting any errors prior to this, and the error has never been encountered before. Nothing was changed between the last successful build and this one, and clearing the NuGet cache had no effect. The error can be reproduced locally on MSBuild 17.1.0 and in CI on MSBuild 17.0.6, so it seems very unlikely that the issue is related to the release of MSBuild 17.1.0.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\nHere is the relevant portion of the diagnostic output of MSBuild 17.1.0+ae57d105c:\r\n\r\n\r\n...\r\nAll packages and projects are compatible with UAP,Version=v10.0.17763 (win10-x86-aot).

This issue contains summary of the plan for the year and acts as a place for you to leave feedback.\r\n\r\nThis plan is a collection of input from many stakeholders and outlines where we intend to invest our time in NuGet and NuGet.org.\r\n\r\n> **IMPORTANT**\r\n> This plan is not a commitment; it will evolve as we continue to learn throughout the release. Some things that are not currently planned for NuGet may get pulled in. Some things currently planned may even be pushed out.\r\n\r\n# General information\r\n\r\nNuGet has a major release following [NuGet 6.4](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/release-notes/nuget-6.4) and is currently scheduled for release in November 2023 at the same time as .NET 8.\r\n\r\nNuGet will align with the [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) and will therefore be a long-term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\nNuGet.org does not currently follow any specific schedule and releases features & bug fixes regularly throughout the year.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\nNuGet may contain a small number of breaking changes as we continue to evolve NuGet with the .NET platform. Our goal is to minimize breaking changes as much as possible to keep you productive when upgrading. You'll be able to find them at the [.NET 8 Breaking Changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/8.0).\r\n\r\n## Themes\r\n\r\nThe large investments in NuGet are the following themes:\r\n\r\n### Highly Requested Features\r\n\r\nAs always, a major input into our planning process comes from [votes (👍) for features on GitHub](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting-an-issue).\r\n\r\nThese features are areas we are actively engaged in with regards to designing, implementing, and polishing the respective experiences for.\r\n\r\n#### Security\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8087\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1851\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11262\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10730\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12015\r\n\r\n#### Tooling\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9015\r\n\r\n#### Season of Giving\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7752\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8476\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8420\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7912\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6938\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6437\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6279\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6060\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5713\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5556\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5138\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4879\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4855\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4254\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4103\r\n\r\n#### NuGet Gallery\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/3098\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8773\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8964\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9339\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7297\r\n\r\n### .NET Platforms and Ecosystem\r\n\r\nMuch of the work planned for NuGet involves improving the package management experience for .NET across different platforms and ecosystem. This involves work in NuGet to ensure a great experience across .NET technologies.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10430\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10872\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5154\r\n\r\n### Migrating to .NET\r\n\r\nNuGet has always [supported many scenarios for package management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference). In our continued efforts to help you migrate to the latest version of .NET, we will be working on improvements to the [Upgrade Assistant](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant) and core package management experiences to help you migrate your project to use the latest version of NuGet.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nWith each [new release of NuGet & Visual Studio comes a plethora of performance improvements](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/performance-improvements-in-nuget/) when restoring NuGet packages, managing project dependencies, and browsing for the next great package to include in your solution. We will continue to invest time to improve your experiences every .NET & Visual Studio release.\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\n\r\nYour feedback is important to us. The best way to indicate the importance of an issue is to vote (👍) for that [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) and [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/). We use this data to help us with our regular planning so we can work on the things that matter most to you.\r\n\r\nPlease **comment on this issue** if you believe we are missing something that is critical for NuGet, or are focusing on the wrong areas.

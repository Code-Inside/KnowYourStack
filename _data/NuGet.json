I am not using `nuget.exe` or `dotnet.exe` for that matter, just the SDK (NuGet.Protocol and NuGet.Credentials). Because I need to access a NuGet feed that is hosted on Azure Artifacts, I am also using https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider to provide me with credentials for accessing them.\r\n\r\nI am however unable to make it to work. It appears that the PluginCredentialProvider class is calling the external provider .exe using the wrong arguments. Specifically: it does not pass `-F JSON` and therefore the credential response (even though working fine and returning the actual token) is returned in human readable format and not in `JSON`. PluginCredentialProvider therefore is unable to parse the response and thus fails.\r\n\r\nAlso: there is a specific switch for running that external .exe in `plugin` mode and not in `standalone` mode. But that switch is never passed anywhere. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nAlso: the argument `-C` for enabling an interactive UI login is never passed, and therefore DeviceCode flow is used, should credentials not be cached/available already.\r\n\r\nI was able to make it work using the following argument injection trick:\r\n````\r\nvar provider = new PluginCredentialProvider(GetLogger(), GetCredentialProviderPluginPath(), 20, \"minimal -f JSON\");\r\n````\r\nAs you can see, I inject `-F JSON` as part of the `verbosity` parameter. Doing so passes it on to the credential provider which then returns the response in JSON and my token gets returned correctly.\r\n\r\nI don't really understand why this does not work because apparently this .exe is used in VisualStudio and elsewhere. Is this PluginCredentialProvider also used by NuGet.exe itself? Does it work?\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"25670666966","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-12-05T19:23:51","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12297","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Write a spec for dotnet nuget config command\" (#12297) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"25670581343","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-12-05T19:19:43","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12296","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Add a dotnet nuget config command\" (#12296) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nAdd a dotnet nuget config command to manage NuGet configuration settings.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"25649340134","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-12-05T02:35:30","Actor":"NaattyD","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12294","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"log.txt\" (#12294) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"![log.txt](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/10150219/log.txt)"},{"Id":"25649331613","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-12-05T02:34:53","Actor":"NaattyD","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12294","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"log.txt\" (#12294) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"![log.txt](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/10150219/log.txt)"},{"Id":"25628403681","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-12-03T01:39:13","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12293","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Output version option only applicable for format json option in dotnet list package\" (#12293) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nn/a\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nNone\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\n- Address comment https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11983#discussion_r1007254369\r\n`--output-version` option works together with `--format json` only.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"25223918809","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-11-14T14:43:41","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/66","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Associate microsoft account\" (#66) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hi, I want to associate my microsoft account to sig in on nuget.\r\nhelp please ... thks"},{"Id":"25209931462","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-11-14T02:15:16","Actor":"DSBRBrasil","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/66","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Associate microsoft account\" (#66) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hi, I want to associate my microsoft account to sig in on nuget.\r\nhelp please ... thks"},{"Id":"24695608920","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-10-19T11:53:07","Actor":"dtivel","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/64","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Transition from Symantec timestamping service to DigiCert timestamping service\" (#64) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Between October 4th, 2022 and October 24, 2022 we will transition from the deprecated Symantec timestamping service currently in use to the DigiCert timestamping service for both Microsoft author signing and NuGet.org repository signing NuGet packages for new package submissions only.\r\n\r\n*  October 4th – October 24th:  Update NuGet.org repository signing to use http://timestamp.digicert.com.

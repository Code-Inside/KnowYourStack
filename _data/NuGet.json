This failed because dotnet restore creates the lock file without signing. So when I build projectc it works, when I do a second pass on projectc with a msbuild property set to enable signing it would compile the first signed target framework and then blow up with a crazy error.

Its content is something like that:\n\n```\n1.0.0.0\n  |__ runtimes\n    |__win-x64/lib/net452/*.dll\n    |__win-x86/lib/net452/*.dll\n\n```\n\nThe project.json is very simple:\n\n```\n{\n  \"runtimes\": {\n    \"win-x86\": { },\n    \"win-x64\": { }\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"MyPackage\": \"1.0.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"frameworks\": {\n    \"net452\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe result is 1) the package is well displayed in VS under references and 2) the right dll from the package is well copied in the output folder depending on the platform x86/x64.\n**BUT** the referenced dll is not usable in the project i.e. it does not compile if you try to use it in the source code, no intellisense, etc.\n\nActually the dll is not listed in the project references during the compilation. So, I dig into the Microsoft.NuGet.Build.Tasks project and found the issue: in the `GetReferences` method, you always list targets without any runtime identifier:\n`var target = GetTargetOrAttemptFallback(lockFile, needsRuntimeIdentifier: false);`\n\nWhy don't you list targets without _and_ with RID?\n\nThank you.\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"10740159942","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T17:39:29","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/39","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Flag vulnerable packages\" (#39) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec for 'Flagging vulnerable packages' is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|----------|------------------|\r\n|[Flag vulnerable packages](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Flag-vulnerable-packages) | https://github.com/nuget/home/issues/8087|"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1219766107269025792","CreatedAt":"2020-01-21T23:37:56+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi package publishing is currently facing technical difficulty and new packages pushed to… https://t.co/4E67LHHnbI","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":2,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1204812404573392897","CreatedAt":"2019-12-11T17:17:16+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"We are currently experiencing CDN issues in a few geographies.  https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi services like package resto… https://t.co/0ZVMeF11CW","Source":"<a href=\"http://twitter.com/download/iphone\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for iPhone</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1190360390980395008","CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T20:10:07+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"The issue with the publishing pipeline has been resolved and packages are now being published normally. https://t.co/NdK8mVk7UF","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":3,"FavoriteCount":0,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1190331936293572608","CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T18:17:03+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"We are experiencing an issue with our publishing pipeline causing a delay in the publishing of new packages.

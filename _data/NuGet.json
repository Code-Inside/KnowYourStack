It looks like this:\r\n404: https://dev.nugettest.org/dsfsdfseg\r\n500: https://dev.nugettest.org/pages/simulate-error?type=Exception\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is returned for API response pages. The effect of this is that if we try to return an HTTP 404 from an API response (such as the unlist API or the deprecate API), we get the HTML page for that 404 instead of a response message that has the reason phrase containing the error details. In other words, the pretty HTML page clobbers code that we put in there intentionally.\r\n\r\nExample for unlist before the change (note the HTML response body and no helpful reason phrase)\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/94054/099aaba8-9953-4ee7-92ba-86f25ca69b18)\r\n\r\nAfter my change:\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/94054/0bc82aca-d944-4b86-ab66-f748b3ac0c30)\r\n\r\nEssentially the reason phrase (nice error message) provided here became useless long ago when we added pretty default error pages:\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/912cd3bd73432f6edf8a9e20106d3cc635ca99df/src/NuGetGallery/Controllers/ApiController.cs#L876-L877\r\n\r\nI made the change for HTTP 500 as well since I don't believe a full rich HTML page should be returned for exceptions on API endpoints.

See https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4259 for more context.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nWe should enable this retry behavior by default with reasonable values and the same restrictions (i.e.:  untrusted status on Windows) while still allowing users to override or opt-out of the default.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we choose `3,1000` as the default, a user could override by setting the environment variable with different values:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset NUGET_EXPERIMENTAL_CHAIN_BUILD_RETRY_POLICY=10,3000\r\n```\r\n\r\nA user could also opt out (meaning, no retry at all) with a different value (TBD, but possibly just `0`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nset NUGET_EXPERIMENTAL_CHAIN_BUILD_RETRY_POLICY=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nA [GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=NUGET_EXPERIMENTAL_CHAIN_BUILD_RETRY_POLICY&type=code) reveals `3,1000` as the most common value, with `9,2000` being next most common.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThe root problem is that a particular API call isn't retried, and it should be.  Whether or not Windows adds a retry, retrying is the only mitigation.  We can broadly mitigate this issue for NuGet users by retrying by default.\r\n\r\nCC @joelverhagen"},{"Id":"29137132057","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-05-17T17:19:12","Actor":"dainizzz","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12477","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Feature]: add command dotnet config unset\" (#12477) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nNuGet.exe, dotnet.exe\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nFeature for #12469  \r\nThis command will remove the key-value pair from a specified NuGet configuration setting, following [this spec](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/dev/proposed/2022/dotnet-nuget-config-spec.md#unset).\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"28861759967","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-05-04T23:06:51","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/35","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Machine readable output for dotnet list package\" (#35) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec for 'Machine readable output for dotnet list package' is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|----------|------------------|\r\n|[Machine readable output for dotnet list package](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/%5BSpec%5D-Machine-readable-output-for-dotnet-list-package) | https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7752 |"},{"Id":"27557007112","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-07T18:44:23","Actor":"dnfadmin","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/68","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Moving to the new .NET Foundation CLA service\" (#68) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hello everyone\r\nThe .NET Foundation is transitioning to a new CLA service and I'm posting here to let you know it's happening.

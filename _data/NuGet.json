I get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject `MyProject` has the following vulnerable packages\r\n   [net6.0]:\r\n   Transitive Package                    Resolved   Severity   Advisory URL\r\n   > System.Net.Http                     4.3.0      High       https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7jgj-8wvc-jh57\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to information linked from [the advisory URL](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7jgj-8wvc-jh57), this only affects some old .NET Core 1.x and 2.x runtimes. As you can see above, I'm using .NET 6. This false positive is therefore just noise that I have to filter out when scanning for vulnerable packages. This is particularly annoying when running on CI.\r\n\r\nI could install the package directly to update it and get rid of the false positive, but with tens or hundreds of different projects with hundreds of transitive dependencies each, that won't scale. Another aspect is that this is a transitive dependency through `NETStandard.Library` (1.6.1 in my case), so I'm not sure if it should be updated at all. (`NETStandard.Library` is a dependency of `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory` targeting `netstandard1.3`, which again is a dependency of `Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication`, which is a dependency of `dbup-sqlserver`, which is a direct dependency of mine.)\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No

Run `dotnet new console`\r\n2. Replace the project file contents with the following\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\r\n\r\n    <RestoreLockedMode>true</RestoreLockedMode>\r\n    <RestorePackagesWithLockFile>true</RestorePackagesWithLockFile>\r\n    <DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder>true</DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection\" Version=\"6.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run `dotnet restore`\r\n4. Note that `packages.lock.json` specifies version `6.0.0` of `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`\r\n5. Create `Directory.Build.props` with the following contents\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection\" Version=\"5.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run `dotnet restore`\r\n\r\nEXPECTED: \r\n\r\nOperation completes successfully. `packages.lock.json` continues to use version of `6.0.0` of `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`\r\n\r\nACTUAL:\r\n\r\nReceive error message: \r\n\r\n> C:\\temp\\RestoreIssue\\RestoreIssue.csproj : error NU1004: The package reference Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection version has changed from [6.0.0, ) to [5.0.0, ).The packages lock file is inconsistent with the project dependencies so restore can't be run in locked mode.

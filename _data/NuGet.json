It was uploaded by the author.\r\n2. It failed validation due to an incorrect signing certificate.\r\n3. It was pushed again with a proper signing certificate. This resulted in a delete audit entry for the previous copy of that package, which resulted in a delete catalog leaf item because a delete audit was created. Having a delete audit is reasonable. Having a delete leaf is questionable since the package never existed in the catalog to begin with. It's generally harmless though since it is a delete of a non-existent package.\r\n4. The package was then successfully validated resulting in a PackageDetails catalog leaf.\r\n\r\nThe V3 monitoring job \"monitoringprocessing\" produced an \"unknown\" validation record for the queue message produced by \"db2monitoring\" after it saw the delete leaf created in step 3. The problem is that the record had the version \"6.0.16\" in the blob name. It should have had the lowercase full version \"6.0.16+mysql8.1.0\".\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is that the V3 monitoring was stuck on this \"unknown\" blob indefinitely. Unfortunately, the V3 monitoring pipeline uses the full version for its blob names causing build full version and normalized version differences (i.e. versions with metadata like `1.0.0+foo` or `6.0.16+MySQL8.1.0`) to potentially get stuck.\r\n\r\nThis is the root cause: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9633\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nThis should be do-able on DEV.\r\n\r\nProduce a delete leaf for a package version build metadata. You should be able to soft delete a validating package for this.\r\n\r\nVerify that there is an \"unknown\" blob saved to the V3 monitoring container. The blob should not have build metadata in the name.\r\n\r\nUpload a package with that version containing build metadata (`+foo` in `1.0.0+foo` for example).\r\n\r\nThe \"unknown\" blob should remain stuck there forever.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPackages should not be stuck in V3 monitoring for any reason aside from invalid metadata.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"31325091785","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-08-23T18:07:34","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9633","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: Delete catalog leaves use normalized version for \"version\" attribute, not full version\" (#9633) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use NuGet.org\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nCurrently, the `PackageDetails` catalog leaf documents have the full version as their `version` property.

That means once enough projects are included in the restore operation the command argument can exceed the [maximum command line length](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-client/shell-experience/command-line-string-limitation). This will result in the `RestoreTaskEx` task failing as it exceeds this limit.\r\n\r\nBelieve that RestoreTaskEx and NuGet.Build.Tasks.Console.exe should be communicating via a response file. This is common practice when shelling out from a build task to a tool that takes command lines whose length scales with the size of the build input. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\nCan provide a binary log if this helps with the diagnosis.

This is an obvious oversight and quite annoying when needed.\r\nThis is especially important when nuget.exe has been run outside any project, thus making the installed packages unavailable to commands that can only be run in a project context.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nRunning \"nuget.exe install packagename\" outside any project installs the package under the current directory where the user happens to run the command.  Such packages don't appear in the output of PowerShell Get-Package, and there is no easily found information on how to list or remove packages installed that way.\r\n\r\nIf this installation method is unintended and removed in a future nuget.exe version, users will still need a tool to uninstall those things."},{"Id":"22121257512","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-02T09:35:03","Actor":"v-luzh","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11806","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"[Bug]: [Bug Bash] The “Version” dropdown box is blank in “Consolidate” tab of solution-level PM UI\" (#11806) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\nDev\\6.3.0.51\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\n### Details about Problem\r\nVS Version: Main\\32509.107\r\nNuGet Version: Dev\\6.3.0.51\r\nOS Version: Windows-11-Enterprise-21H2\r\n\r\n### Repro steps:\r\n1.Create a solution with two C# Console App (.NET Framework 4.8) projects in VS.\r\n2.Right-Click the solution in the Solution Explorer and select the “Mange NuGet Packages for Solution”.\r\n3.Go to “Browse” tab, select a package (e.g. Newtonsoft.Json) and install different versions (with PackageReference format) into the different projects.

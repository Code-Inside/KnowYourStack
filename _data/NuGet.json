This, of course, does not apply to me. \r\nSomebody in that thread said they \"couldn't easily test arch linux\", do know that [Fedora is avaliable under WSL just like Arch](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9npcp8drchsn?hl=en-US&gl=US). However, it might also help to try and reproduce this under a VM, in case WSL introduces some extra stuff that makes the issue unreproducable.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n➜  onedrive98 dotnet new console           \r\n\r\nWelcome to .NET 8.0!\r\n---------------------\r\nSDK Version: 8.0.102\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nWrite your first app: https://aka.ms/dotnet-hello-world\r\nFind out what's new: https://aka.ms/dotnet-whats-new\r\nExplore documentation: https://aka.ms/dotnet-docs\r\nReport issues and find source on GitHub: https://github.com/dotnet/core\r\nUse 'dotnet --help' to see available commands or visit: https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe template \"Console App\" was created successfully.\r\n\r\nProcessing post-creation actions...\r\nRestoring /home/gavin/Projects/onedrive98/onedrive98.csproj:\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n```\r\n"},{"Id":"36809720201","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-03-22T20:08:11","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13295","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Using the 'TargetFrameworks' and 'OutputPath' causes command 'dotnet pack  --artifacts-path' to be abnormal\" (#13295) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nNuGet SDK\n\n### Product Version\n\ndotnet sdk 8.0.200\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\n## Description\r\nBoth `TargetFrameworks` and `OutputPath` Property are defined in the project file, the `dll` in the `lib` directory in the `.nupkg` file is the same\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>net40;net45;net48;net8.0</TargetFrameworks>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|AnyCPU' \">\r\n    <OutputPath>.\\Export\\Debug\\</OutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|AnyCPU' \">\r\n    <OutputPath>.\\Export\\Release\\</OutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nuse command\r\n```\r\ndotnet pack \"./Log.Simple.csproj\"  --artifacts-path C:\\packs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n`Log.Simple.nupkg\\lib\\net40\\Log.Simple.dll ` is not equal `Log.Simple.nupkg\\lib\\net8.0\\Log.Simple.dll `\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n`Log.Simple.nupkg\\lib\\net40\\Log.Simple.dll ` equal `Log.Simple.nupkg\\lib\\net8.0\\Log.Simple.dll `\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\nuse `dotnet pack \"./Log.Simple.csproj\" ` I get msbuild partial log\r\n```\r\nLog.Simple -> C:\\Workspace\\Common\\Export\\Release\\net48\\Log.Simple.dll\r\nLog.Simple -> C:\\Workspace\\Common\\Export\\Release\\net45\\Log.Simple.dll\r\nLog.Simple -> C:\\Workspace\\Common\\Export\\Release\\net8.0\\Log.Simple.dll\r\nLog.Simple -> C:\\Workspace\\Common\\Export\\Release\\net40\\Log.Simple.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\nuse `dotnet pack \"./Log.Simple.csproj\" --artifacts-path C:\\packs ` I get msbuild partial log\r\n```\r\nLog.Simple -> C:\\Workspace\\Common\\Export\\Release\\Log.Simple.dll\r\nLog.Simple -> C:\\Workspace\\Common\\Export\\Release\\Log.Simple.dll\r\nLog.Simple -> C:\\Workspace\\Common\\Export\\Release\\Log.Simple.dll\r\nLog.Simple -> C:\\Workspace\\Common\\Export\\Release\\Log.Simple.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 环境\r\n```\r\n.NET SDK:\r\n Version:           8.0.200\r\n Commit:            438cab6a9d\r\n Workload version:  8.0.200-manifests.e575128c\r\n\r\n运行时环境:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.19045\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.200\\\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"36809657386","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-03-22T20:05:33","Actor":"vedion","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13344","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"\"dotnet restore --locked-mode\" does not respect global.json\" (#13344) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n.NET Core SDK v8.0.202\n\n### Worked before?\n\nI do not think so\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet. Packaging versions). If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET SDKs.\r\n\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.8.0 or lower, you should download and install 6.8.1 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.8.1/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.7.0 or lower, you should download and install 6.7.1 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.7.1/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.6.1 or lower, you should download and install 6.6.2 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.6.2/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.4.2 or lower, you should download and install 6.4.3 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.4.3/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.3.3 or lower, you should download and install 6.3.4 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.3.4/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.0.5 or lower, you should download and install 6.0.6 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.0.6/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 5.11.5 or lower, you should download and install 5.11.6 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v5.11.6/nuget.exe.\r\n\r\nYou can get the version of NuGet.exe by running the `nuget` command.

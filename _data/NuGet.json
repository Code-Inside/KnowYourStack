Therefore, it is no longer private storage for NuGet's internal use. As a consequence, the NuGet team has progressively reduced calling the global packages folder a cache, even if many customers still call it the \"NuGet cache\".\r\n\r\nThe NuGet general options page in VS options, there's a button that still says \"Clear Nuget Cache(s)\".  This could be renamed to make it more obvious that clicking the button deletes not only the global packages folder, but other ones as well. Also, it might help slowly de-associate the global packages folder as being \"the cache\".\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"23905463930","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-09-08T23:57:51","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8380","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Documentation:  NuGet API documentation does not describe possible exceptions\" (#8380) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/visual-studio-extensibility/nuget-api-in-visual-studio.\r\n\r\nXML doc comments for each interface member should describe which exceptions may be thrown and why via the [`<exception />`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/exception) tag."},{"Id":"23905389274","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-09-08T23:49:36","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6055","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Doc] Need to reopen solution to update nuget UI after change NuGet.config manully or add new NuGet.config\" (#6055) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"23903983270","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-09-08T21:46:33","Actor":"azimman123","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/12085","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Dev kartheekp ms uidelay8675 spec\" (#12085) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"_Tander_"},{"Id":"23903578422","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-09-08T21:18:17","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12083","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: 5 minutes to install the nuget package with a lot of package files\" (#12083) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI'm creating an msbuild task which we deliver as a nuget package.

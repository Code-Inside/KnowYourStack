This certificate is used to verify the content integrity of a package and protect against content tampering. When the signing certificate expires, it will fallback to a timestamp for verification.\r\n\r\nFor packages that have not been automatically re-signed by NuGet.org with an updated certificate, you may be affected by [.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions using NSS or ca-certificates](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56). Only a subset of NuGet.org packages have been re-signed with a new certificate since March 15th, 2021.\r\n\r\nGiven that the [NuGet Microsoft author signing certificate has already expired](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/microsoft-author-signing-certificate-update/), you may have already ran into this issue if you have a Microsoft author signed package in your environment and may already be aware of this change in behavior & resolved it.\r\n\r\nFor reference of the different types of NuGet signatures:\r\n\r\n- **Author signature.** An author signature guarantees that the package has not been modified since the author signed the package, no matter from which repository or what transport method the package is delivered. Additionally, author-signed packages provide an extra authentication mechanism to the nuget.org publishing pipeline because the signing certificate must be registered ahead of time. \r\n- **Repository signature.** Repository signatures provide an integrity guarantee for all packages in a repository whether they are author signed or not, even if those packages are obtained from a different location than the original repository where they were signed.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nYour Linux environment may give you error messages when running `dotnet restore` such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror NU3028: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The author primary signature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: self signed certificate in certificate chain\r\n\r\nerror NU3037: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The author primary signature validity period has expired.\r\n\r\nerror NU3028: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository countersignature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: self signed certificate in certificate chain\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis indicates that your environment is affected by an upstream change to [nss](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/) or `ca-certificates` packages and you'll need to update your .NET SDK to resolve it.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds have been provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you update to these builds as soon as you can to mitigate disruption on Linux environments.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nFor more details on this incident, see the following resources:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56\r\n- https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/net-5-nuget-restore-failures-on-linux-distributions-using-nss-or-ca-certificates/\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180\r\n\r\nIf you run into this issue after April 14th, 2021, please provide a comment on https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712"},{"Id":"15789095683","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T22:00:20","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/57","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet.org temporarily down due to Azure services outage\" (#57) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"NuGet.org is being affected by an outage due to issues affecting the Azure Portal and Azure services, but the team is on it.

To work around this, you can temporarily target against .NET Core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Modify CA Certificate Store\r\n\r\nDepending on your Linux distro, you can modify your CA certificate store by taking on an earlier version of your `ca-certificates` package.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the affected version is [nss 3.63+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.63_release_notes). `nss` includes a hard-coded list of trusted CA certificates and therefore can be modified to include and trust the `Verisign Universal Root Certificate Authority` again.\r\n\r\nMany Linux distros can leverage `dpkg-reconfigure` to check for the entry and enable trust for it. As a manual workaround, you may need to remove a `leading !` from the certificate line & update your CA certificates package.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Doing this is considered a bad security practice & should only be done if you understand the security implications of doing so.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nDue to existing issues with the .NET 5 signing verification feature & fallback of timestamp verification, we have decided to revoke this feature for Unix-based systems within .NET 5 SDK. Therefore your experience of using `dotnet restore` will remain largely the same as it was in .NET Core 3.1. Stay tuned for an updated .NET SDK version that will include this change.\r\n\r\n### Stay updated\r\n\r\n- We are continuing to investigate this issue and will let you know more as we find out.\r\n- We will also continue posting updates on [NuGet Status](https://status.nuget.org/) and [@NuGet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuget)."},{"Id":"15596835672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T16:16:18","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/55","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package Namespaces Proposal\" (#55) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Introduction of a feature concept called Package Namespaces which allows a developer to include or exclude package IDs by specifying package namespaces on their package source(s).\r\n\r\n🎉📦Please provide your comments, concerns, and feedback within this PR. 📦🎉\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/10660"},{"Id":"15469893086","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:14:19","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/54","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Custom V2 OData queries will be deprecated March 9th, 2021 \" (#54) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (#37) last year and conducted a dry run of the deprecation to ensure that there are no surprises for users (#40). \r\n\r\nWe will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in March 9, 2021, as detailed in [the blogpost here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/custom-v2-odata-queries-will-be-deprecated-march-9-2021/).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know about your questions or concerns on [this discussion post.](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7423)"},{"Id":"15322501248","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-25T20:01:29","Actor":"chgill-MSFT","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/53","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021\" (#53) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021.

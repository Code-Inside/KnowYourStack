Because it is filled by a code that scans \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETPortable\". Going down the directories, this code reads xml files found in \"vXXX\\Profile\\ProfileYYY\\SupportedFrameworks\" subdirectories.\r\nFor each \"ProfileYYY\" directory, it construct a NetPortableProfile, and the supportedFrameworks is filled by these xml files.\r\nBUT, I don't know why, profiles that starts with \"Mono\" or \"Xamarin\" are considered optionals, and removed from the list. Problem is that, on my computer, there are only Xamarin and Mono profiles...\r\n\r\nTo find this, I had to use the project Core found in Nuget.Client sources, and replaced in Nuget.Server sources the dependency to the deprecated package by this project. After that, if I add a test to check if the IEnumerable is not empty before trying to construct a NetPortableProfile, everything seems to be working fine.\r\nOf course this is a terrible hack, but for me the fundamental problem is that Nuget.Server use a deprecated package with no official sources, so there was no other way for me to find a solution.\r\n\r\nSo, did anybody already encountered this problem ? Is Something wrong in my computer configuration (the supported frameworks) ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your support!"},{"Id":"10930064473","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T23:38:46","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7709","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Dropped the `DiagnosticMonitorTraceListener` usage.\" (#7709) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Progress on https://github.com/NuGet/Engineering/issues/1912\r\n\r\nRemoved some dead code. `DiagnosticMonitorTraceListener` needs to be configured, we don't have any configuration code in the project (or in web.config)."},{"Id":"10929792843","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T22:38:54","Actor":"loic-sharma","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7712","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Link to 'evaluate packages' documentation\" (#7712) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/737941/69391216-f55ec080-0c86-11ea-94d4-eeefcbe100a5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/NuGet/Engineering/issues/2763"},{"Id":"10928200948","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T18:28:55","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/6094","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGet.Server returns 406 instead of 409 on conflict\" (#6094) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"When using `nuget push` to publish a package with ID and version already existing on my feed, I receive a 406 (Not Acceptable) error instead of a 409 (Conflict).

It doesn't describe the root problem, leaving developers and DevOps engineers in the dark as to how to address it. The abundance of reports and attempted/failed solutions found at StackOverflow and elsewhere attest to this.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In Azure DevOps (Services or Server), create a new collection-scoped feed\r\n2. Note that the feed's permissions do not include the project-scoped build identity\r\n3. Publish a package to the feed\r\n4. Create a Git repository\r\n5. Create a pipeline build that consumes the repository and is triggered by a `git push`\r\n6. Add a `nuget restore` step to the pipeline\r\n7. In the `nuget restore` step, reference the feed\r\n8. Create a Visual Studio project that references the package\r\n9. `git push` the code to the repository\r\n10. Note the misleading error message in the build's logs\r\n11. Add the project-scoped build identity to the feed's permissions\r\n12. Run the pipeline again (afresh, not a rerun)\r\n13. Note that the error no longer occurs\r\n\r\nThe message can be adjusted to more accurately reflect the error it attempts to describe.\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\n2023-02-01T19:45:39.5301164Z ##[section]Starting: NuGet restore\r\n2023-02-01T19:45:39.5437559Z ==============================================================================\r\n2023-02-01T19:45:39.5437830Z Task         : NuGet\r\n2023-02-01T19:45:39.5438327Z Description  : Restore, pack, or push NuGet packages, or run a NuGet command.

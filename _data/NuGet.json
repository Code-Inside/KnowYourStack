However, no PackageReference entries have been added to my csproj, and if I delete the projects obj folder then the references dissapear and I can't build the project.\r\n\r\nWhat's going on?  Even adding a random package like BoDi does nothing to my ,csproj.  Do I now need to check in the contents of my /obj folder to source control to get PackageReference to work in my builds???\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"38226890636","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-09T09:03:18","Actor":"CiciLi1","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13432","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Localization] The ‘Microsoft.VisualStudio.FallbackLocation.config’ configuration file is missing in ‘Option-> Configuration Files’ window  \" (#13432) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\nNuGet Client Dev\\6.10.0.97\n\n### Worked before?\n\nIt is not a regression since ‘configuration files’ node is a new feature from last localization test. \n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.

If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET SDKs.\r\n\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.8.0 or lower, you should download and install 6.8.1 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.8.1/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.7.0 or lower, you should download and install 6.7.1 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.7.1/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.6.1 or lower, you should download and install 6.6.2 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.6.2/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.4.2 or lower, you should download and install 6.4.3 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.4.3/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.3.3 or lower, you should download and install 6.3.4 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.3.4/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.0.5 or lower, you should download and install 6.0.6 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.0.6/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 5.11.5 or lower, you should download and install 5.11.6 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v5.11.6/nuget.exe.\r\n\r\nYou can get the version of NuGet.exe by running the `nuget` command.

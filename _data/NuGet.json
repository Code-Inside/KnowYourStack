According to this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files\r\nIf I mark it as a developmentDependency, it prevents the package from being included as a dependency in other packages, which is what I want.\r\nHowever, it also excludes compile-time assets from compilation, which I do not want.\r\nCurrently, when I consume the package I have to add compile; to the IncludeAssets of the PackageReference and then everything works, but this is cumbersome.\r\nIs there a way to author the package so that I can control how the PackageReference gets created? E.g. so that it will add \"compile\" automatically.\r\n\r\nTo give a little more context, the tools are doing some code generation and for it to work the libs needs to be referenced. So I'm looking for something that's both a developmentDependency (Does not allow adding my package as a dependency), but still allows my package to have libs referenced.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"12417146961","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-05-22T19:53:39","Actor":"kartheekp-ms","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9598","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Error NU3001 has 7 scenarios causing maintainability issues\" (#9598) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"[NU3001](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu3001) error code has 7 scenarios where few of them are dependent upon [`Exception.HResult Property`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.exception.hresult) causing maintainability issues.\r\n\r\nFor e.g. https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/eb9ad919724e5ef435d6321b775868c9f2c0f9a2/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/SignCommand/CertificateProvider.cs#L59-L90\r\n\r\nThis logic broke tests in package signing logic when `dotnet` returns a different `HRResult` value.

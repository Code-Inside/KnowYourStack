If another actor has updated the version list since it was read, an HTTP 412 is thrown causing the operation to fail and the job to crash. This is fine because the job will quickly retry and be fine this time (probably).\r\n\r\nIn the case of Catalog2AzureSearch, the amount of work that is re-done is very small. A couple of catalog leaves.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Auxiliary2AzureSearch, the amount of work that is re-done can be very large. If the downloads.v1.json file has changes, this could be thousands of documents that need new download counts. It's not great to start over.\r\n\r\n### Basic example\r\n\r\nSuppose the downloads.v1.json file has changed and Auxiliary2AzureSearch is chomping through the diff pushing all of the new download counts to Azure Search. \r\n\r\nAlso suppose a package owner has pushed a new version of one of the download counts that changed.\r\n\r\nIf Catalog2AzureSearch updates the version list around the same time as Auxiliary2AzureSearch running, Auxiliary2AzureSearch can fail because it sees the version list has changed.\r\n\r\n### Easy fix\r\n\r\nMake the jobs catch the failure and retry one or two times for the set of packages that failed with HTTP 412.\r\n\r\n### Exception text\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Job Failed to Run\": \"Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.StorageException: The remote server returned an

It seems like this scenario is now broken in a major way. Clearly the generated installers are running and respond to various MSBuild config flags, but it's just not possible to have the VSIX source resolve the NuGet packages unless they come from an external pre-configured package source.\r\n\r\nThere is also no way to simply add the package references to the project without trying to resolve them, so item templates in particular are critically broken. This has recently broken a development pipeline that has worked for 8 years so far with no problem, and there seems to be no guidance whatsoever on how to proceed with VSIX-based project and item templates going forward.\r\n\r\nAll relevant details are presented below, and also in the stack overflow question:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61009788/how-do-you-actually-include-nuget-packages-in-visual-studio-project-templates-vs\r\n\r\nDetailed guidance would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: VS UI\r\nNuGet version (from package manager console): 5.5.0.6473\r\nVS version (if appropriate): VS 2019 Community\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): Win10 \r\n\r\nWorked before? If so, with which NuGet version: VS 2010 through VS 2017\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1. Create an item template project with the following `.vsixtemplate`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<VSTemplate Version=\"3.0.0\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/vstemplate/2005\" Type=\"Item\">\r\n  <TemplateData>\r\n...\r\n  </TemplateData>\r\n  <TemplateContent>\r\n    <References />\r\n    <ProjectItem SubType=\"Code\" TargetFileName=\"$fileinputname$.cs\" ReplaceParameters=\"true\">TransformTemplate.cs</ProjectItem>\r\n  </TemplateContent>\r\n  <WizardExtension>\r\n    <Assembly>NuGet.VisualStudio.Interop, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a</Assembly>\r\n    <FullClassName>NuGet.VisualStudio.TemplateWizard</FullClassName>\r\n  </WizardExtension>\r\n  <WizardData>\r\n    <packages repository=\"extension\" repositoryId=\"71c04463-bbae-4a14-8b03-624931eb88c9\">\r\n      <package id=\"Rx-Linq\" version=\"2.2.5\" />\r\n    </packages>\r\n  </WizardData>\r\n</VSTemplate>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create a VSIX project with the following `.vsixmanifest`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\r\n<PackageManifest Version=\"2.0.0\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/vsx-schema/2011\" xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/vsx-schema-design/2011\">\r\n  <Metadata>\r\n    <Identity Id=\"71c04463-bbae-4a14-8b03-624931eb88c9\" Version=\"1.0.0\" Language=\"en-US\" Publisher=\"Author\" />\r\n...\r\n  </Metadata>\r\n  <Installation>\r\n    <InstallationTarget Version=\"[16.0,)\" Id=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Pro\" />\r\n    <InstallationTarget Version=\"[16.0,)\" Id=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Enterprise\" />\r\n    <InstallationTarget Version=\"[16.0,)\" Id=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community\" />\r\n  </Installation>\r\n  <Dependencies>\r\n    <Dependency Id=\"Microsoft.Framework.NDP\" DisplayName=\"Microsoft .NET Framework\" d:Source=\"Manual\" Version=\"[4.7.2,)\" />\r\n  </Dependencies>\r\n  <Assets>\r\n    <Asset Type=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.ItemTemplate\" d:Source=\"Project\" d:ProjectName=\"CustomItemTemplate\" d:TargetPath=\"|CustomItemTemplate;TemplateProjectOutputGroup|\" Path=\"ItemTemplates\" d:VsixSubPath=\"ItemTemplates\" />\r\n    <Asset Type=\"Rx-Linq.2.2.5.nupkg\" d:Source=\"File\" Path=\"Packages\\Rx-Linq.2.2.5.nupkg\" d:VsixSubPath=\"Packages\" />\r\n  </Assets>\r\n  <Prerequisites>\r\n    <Prerequisite Id=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.CoreEditor\" Version=\"[15.0,)\" DisplayName=\"Visual Studio core editor\" />\r\n  </Prerequisites>\r\n</PackageManifest>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Make sure to include the `.nupkg` files in the Packages folder of the VSIX project, and make sure that the resulting VSIX contains the relevant `.nupkg` in its `Packages` folder.\r\n\r\n4. Install the VSIX package.\r\n\r\n5. Create a new project in VS 2019, **disable every remote package source registered in nuget package manager** (so that the template is forced to resolve the reference using the VSIX as package source) and add an item using the item template.\r\n\r\n6. Verify that the template fails to execute correctly, with the following error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5315880/78365198-a753b500-75b6-11ea-8cb7-d2cdca7eb5ef.png)\r\n\r\n7. Verify that the folder indicated in the error message actually exists, and the relevant packages are contained in it.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n## Other suggested things~\r\n\r\nTry to use the item template itself as package source, the folder listed in the error message will change, but behavior will persist.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"12862495052","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T17:39:09","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9371","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"add language Category filter  support to nuget ?\" (#9371) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"when we search some keyword in nuget,we always got some C# package.\r\nbut maybe we are searching native or other languages(C++....)\r\npls give peoples a Options for filtering language. thanks"},{"Id":"12862428814","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-09T17:31:37","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8546","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Provide constructive CLI message when Dotnet pack is missing MSBuild Target\" (#8546) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\nWith a .NET Framework project, the dotnet CLI does not have necessary Targets (eg, NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack) for performing `dotnet pack`.

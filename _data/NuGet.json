For those who really want to get results sorted by some package parameter(title, downloads, etc.) a basic query flow could be:\r\n> 1. Access [https://www.nuget.org/packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages) and use your search term to get the total number of packages matching your criteria(you can use it in step 2, when querying for packages using the API).\r\n> 2. Get the JSON results from [https://api-v2v3search-0.nuget.org/query?q=some-package-query&prerelease=false&take=100&skip=0](https://api-v2v3search-0.nuget.org/query?q=some-package-query&prerelease=false&take=100&skip=0)(replacing `some-package-query` with whatever your search term is). As a mention, the [https://api-v2v3search-0.nuget.org/query](https://api-v2v3search-0.nuget.org/query) URL comes from nuget's API URL list, [https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json](https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json).\r\n> 3. Paste the JSON into a site like [http://www.jsonquerytool.com/#/Lodash](http://www.jsonquerytool.com/#/Lodash), replacing the extraction query with the following:\r\n> ```js\r\n> _.chain(input)\r\n>     .result('data')\r\n>     .values()\r\n>     .map(x => ({\r\n>         id: x.id,\r\n>         version: x.version,\r\n>         description: x.description,\r\n>         title: x.title,\r\n>         totalDownloads: x.totalDownloads,\r\n>         url: 'https://www.nuget.org/packages/' + x.id\r\n>     }))\r\n>     .sortBy('totalDownloads')\r\n>     .reverse()\r\n>     .value();\r\n> ```\r\n> 4. Select the package and access it's respective URL for more info.\r\n> \r\n> The official way of doing this is described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29863508/how-to-find-nuget-package-sort-by-most-downloaded-using-the-console), but I could not make it work, not even using `totalDownloads` as a column.\r\n> \r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @kinkoazc in https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1739#issuecomment-490421573_"},{"Id":"12317795202","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-05-12T23:07:08","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9555","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ComputeSignature is silent by default in .NET Core, which disables PIN prompts\" (#9555) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"The current overload of ComputeSignature changed meaning between .NET Framework and .NET Core.

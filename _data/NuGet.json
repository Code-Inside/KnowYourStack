This follows Visual Studio's version numbers, but 11.0 versions behind. For example, NuGet 6.0 shipped in Visual Studio 2012 17.0. NuGet 5.11 shipped in Visual Studio 2019 16.11.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the assemblies matched the build number, just like the rest of NuGet's assemblies. In other words, in build 6.0.0.280, all assemblies had the version 6.0.0.280. In NuGet build 5.11.0.10 has assembly version 5.11.0.10.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nThe package version for the Visual Studio extensibility APIs should match the version (at least the major and minor version) of Visual Studio that those APIs are available in. For example, the package version for NuGet APIs that are available in dev 17.1 should be package version 17.1.x\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the assembly version for all builds in the same Major.Minor.Patch should use the same assembly version, to avoid binding redirect issues, similar to how Newtonsoft.Json use the same assembly version for all packages with the same major version.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nNuGet.VisualStudio 6.0.0 did not work when Visual Studio 2022 17.0 was first released, for reasons explained in this issue: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11367.\r\n\r\nWhile the primary goal is to ensure this type of error can never happen again, we can take the opportunity to reduce confusion about which version of NuGet's APIs should be used in which version of Visual Studio."},{"Id":"18959113739","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-19T00:57:46","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11401","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"PackageSearchMetadata allocates PackageIdentity on every access to the identity property. \" (#11401) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blame/dev/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/Model/PackageSearchMetadata.cs#L47\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1458922810328371207","CreatedAt":"2021-11-11T22:21:18+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Hi friends 👋\n\nHelp us deliver an amazing target framework filtering package search experience by reviewing our prop… https://t.co/AYWrsHhZcZ","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":12,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1457785562614493192","CreatedAt":"2021-11-08T19:02:17+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🚢 Announcing #NuGet 6.0! \n \n📍 Source mapping\n6️⃣ .NET 6 Support\n🔒 Package Vulnerabilities\n🧑‍🔬 Retry &amp; Backoff Behav… https://t.co/qIK6tRSw87","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":164,"FavoriteCount":61,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1448351779423457281","CreatedAt":"2021-10-13T18:15:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Help us understand your package push workflow! https://t.co/7zALBMJ0xH","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":1,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1438283829102456833","CreatedAt":"2021-09-15T23:29:21+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🙌New feature announcement🙌\n\nMap packages to target sources using Package Source Mapping 🗺️\n\nSecuring your package s… https://t.co/UCSO5dcMpz","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":68,"FavoriteCount":30,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1417880494994198529","CreatedAt":"2021-07-21T16:13:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi will be migrating towards a new multi-CDN infrastructure.

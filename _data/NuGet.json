On Windows: Create a new test **certificate1**:  `.\\CreateTestCertificate.ps1 -AddAsTrustedRootAuthority -Password password -GenerateCerFile` (in the powershell \"Developer Command Prompt\"). \r\n    On Linux: Copy the .cer file (should be generated under the same path with .pfx file) and the .pfx file from the above Windows machine to Linux machine.\r\n3. On Windows: Create another test **certificate2**:  `.\\CreateTestCertificate.ps1 -AddAsTrustedRootAuthority -Password password -GenerateCerFile` (in the powershell \"Developer Command Prompt\"). \r\n    On Linux: Copy the .cer file (should be generated under the same path with .pfx file) and the .pfx file from the above Windows machine to Linux machine.\r\n4. Where <CertificateFilePath> is the file path to the created two certificates (in step2 & step3) .cer or .pem file and <VersionedSdkDirectoryPath> is the directory path for the patched versioned .NET SDK directory (e.g.:  ./patchedSDK/sdk/7.0.100), add trust for **the two certificates:** \r\n    On Linux:  `./dotnet run --project ./Entropy/TrustTestCert/TrustTestCert.csproj --framework net7.0 -- add -c <CertificateFile1Path> -vsd <VersionedSdkDirectoryPath> `\r\n    On Linux: ` ./dotnet run --project ./Entropy/TrustTestCert/TrustTestCert.csproj --framework net7.0 -- add -c <CertificateFile2Path> -vsd <VersionedSdkDirectoryPath> `\r\n5. Use the patched \"dotnet.exe\" to sign a package for the first time. Where <PackageFilePath> is the test package path and <PfxFilePath> is the file path to the .pfx file of the **first** trusted certificate, sign the test package: \r\n    On Linux: ` ./patchedSDK ./dotnet nuget sign <PackageFilePath> --certificate-path <PfxFilePath> --certificate-password password --timestamper http://timestamp.digicert.com/ -v n `\r\n6. Verify that the package is signed successfully in the output, with no warnings and no errors.\r\n   Package(s) signed successfully. \r\n7. Use the patched \"dotnet.exe\" to sign the package for the second time. Where <PackageFilePath> is the test package path and <PfxFilePath> is the file path to the .pfx file of the **second** trustedccertificate, sign the test package: \r\n    On Linux:  `./patchedSDK./dotnet nuget sign <PackageFilePath> --certificate-path <PfxFilePath> --certificate-password password --timestamper http://timestamp.digicert.com/ -v n `\r\n\r\n#### Expected:\r\nVerify that the second signing failed for 1 error in the output: \r\nError: NU3001: The package already contains a signature.

Some background info:\r\n\r\nThe new CLA service is based off of https://github.com/microsoft/ContributorLicenseAgreement, except it uses the dotnet-policy-service app\r\n\r\n- Current contributors do not need to sign the CLA again\r\n- The CLA agreement itself is not changing\r\n- As part of the install/configuration process, the following work items will be completed\r\n\r\n1. Create a .github repo if it doesn't exist already\r\n2. Install the dotnet-policy-service app\r\n3. Create PRs for the platformcontext.xml and cla.yml files\r\n4. Disable the existing CLA webhook\r\n5. Push the PRs to enable the new CLA service\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it.

This change allows our team flexibility to switch to a back-up provider in the case that one CDN is down, which will broaden coverage for our users.\r\n\r\nSome changes are coming for older TLS cipher suites, which may result in connectivity issues. From our data we believe this will affect only a small percentage of requests. We will be monitoring all feedback channels during the migration to assess impact and adjust our roll-out timeline as needed.\r\n\r\nBelow, we provide resources to determine whether you will be affected by this change. This utilizes the [.NET CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to install a package from our pre-production (INT) environment which tests connectivity:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir cdn-test\r\ncd cdn-test\r\ndotnet new classlib\r\ndotnet add package BaseTestPackage.NetStandard --source https://apiint.nugettest.org/v3/index.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing connectivity issues while connecting to nuget.org or restoring packages from https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json, such as:\r\n\r\n\"The SSL connection could not be established\"\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that TLS 1.2 and any of the following cipher suites have been enabled on your machine:\r\n\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, do reach out to us at support@nuget.org or by commenting on the discussion issue: NuGet/Home#11058"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1631370937248481281","CreatedAt":"2023-03-02T19:08:35+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Your package's README is your chance to showcase your hard work and make a great first impression.

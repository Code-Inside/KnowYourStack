I've got a wide array of interlaced dependencies separated into multiple repositories. Changing this is not an option. To keep third party and local packages in sync, we thought CPM would be good, so we keep a central repository and keep our `Directory.Packages.Props` files managed there. At the pipeline build time, we simply fetch that file to the `$(SolutionDir)` and bam, build successful.\r\n\r\nThe problems come when developing locally. It's the wish of every developer to simply fetch and pull code from git and just click build, and have it work, but no PreBuild or PreRelease event type functionality could be found to invoke a download of that Directory.Packages.Props file. \r\n\r\nThe linked item here seems to no longer work: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4781\r\nThe item above has a few targets from various target files which seem to apply before restore, but when I tried it did not work.\r\nEverything i tried would restore first, fail (and pull versions despite the failure....different issue), and never try to execute the pull (since it failed before it).\r\n\r\nIs this supported but has been disabled? Does it only fail because events can only exist in csproj files, before slnx solves that? Any insight into this would be helpful.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"43493149446","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-11-04T19:11:49","Actor":"Nigusu-Allehu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13898","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \" Simplify `CacheFile.LogMessages` by Removing Unnecessary `IAssetsLogMessage` Interface\" (#13898) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"**Problem:**  \r\n`CacheFile.LogMessages` currently uses `IList<IAssetsLogMessage>`, adding unnecessary complexity for a data-only structure.

Everything works fine so far, the task does what it should but a problem is the installation of the nuget package. It takes around 5 minutes to install the nuget package and there is not real log to identify the source of the lag.\r\n\r\nDuring development I simply increase the version number to show a new package version. Afterwards I go to a demo project that contains the nuget package. I then simply update the nuget package in my demo project to the latest version, and this is what I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRestoring NuGet packages...\r\nRunning restore with 32 concurrent jobs.\r\nReading project file D:\\GIT\\IPIPE\\Libraries\\Managed\\siemens.CUDA\\siemens.CUDA.csproj.\r\nThe restore inputs for 'siemens.CUDA' have changed.

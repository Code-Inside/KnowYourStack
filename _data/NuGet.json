The class library uses certain Files (xml) which is accessed in few of the functions in the library. While consuming the package we are using 'packagereference' insted of 'package.config'. Problem is the functions that refer to the files (xml) start failing with error 'path not found'. \r\n\r\nThe below was tried to fix the error but with no result\r\n- Copy To Output directory option is set on all the xml files that the program refer to.\r\n- Files section was added with reference to the xml files in \"*.nuspec\" file \r\n\r\nThe xml files are seen in the content section of the nuget package. The file names are also seen in the 'project.assets.json'. But with 'package reference' the required files are not getting copied to the base directory of the application consuming the nuget package, which is causing the program to fail. Is there a way to solve this ?"},{"Id":"13531719355","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-15T22:14:23","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9963","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Compare perf & tab-switch bugs between Dev and VS.OE branches\" (#9963) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Created per @aortiz-msft request in 8/31/20 standup"},{"Id":"13530246490","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-15T19:35:58","Actor":"dominoFire","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9999","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Ability to extend Default Mappings\" (#9999) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used:  VS UI : Issue is true across all products\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): latest dev\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe --version (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): 16.7.2\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): \r\n\r\nWorked before?

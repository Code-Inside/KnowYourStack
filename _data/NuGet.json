On Windows: Create a new test certificate:    ` .\\CreateTestCertificate.ps1 -AddAsTrustedRootAuthority -Type SSLServerAuthentication -Password password -GenerateCerFile`  (in the powershell \"Developer Command Prompt\"). \r\n   On macOS: Copy the .cer file(should be generated under the same path with .pfx file) and the .pfx file from the above Windows machine to macOS machine.\r\n3. Go to the patchedSDK path and run the command as below. Where <CertificateFilePath> is the file path to the created certificate (in step1) .cer or .pem file and <VersionedSdkDirectoryPath> is the directory path for the patched versioned .NET SDK directory (e.g.:  ./patchedSDK/sdk/7.0.100), add trust for the certificate: \r\nOn macOS:  `./dotnet run --project ./Entropy/TrustTestCert/TrustTestCert.csproj --framework net7.0 -- add -c <CertificateFilePath> -vsd <VersionedSdkDirectoryPath> `\r\n4. Use the patched \"dotnet.exe\" to sign a package. Where <PackageFilePath> is the test package path and <PfxFilePath> is the file path to the .pfx file, sign the test package: \r\nOn macOS:  `./dotnet nuget sign <PackageFilePath> --overwrite --certificate-path <PfxFilePath> --certificate-password password --timestamper http://timestamp.digicert.com/ -v n `\r\n5.

But how to fix it when it was used for the actual transformations?\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create an empty C# project\r\n2. Add `BUTR.DependencyInjection` version 2.0.0.43\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n`.pp` files should be correctly transformed into `.cs` files\r\n\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n`.pp` files are not correctly transformed into `.cs` files\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nVS2022\r\nMSBuild version 17.4.1+9a89d02ff for .NET Framework\r\n17.4.1.60106\r\n\r\nVS2022 Preview\r\nMSBuild version 17.5.0-preview-23053-01+ac0911a00 for .NET Framework\r\n17.5.0.5301\r\n\r\nVS2019\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.11.2+f32259642 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

Please describe.\r\n\r\nWhen the SemVer 2.0.0 changes were introduced to the V2 and V3 protocol, they are intended to mitigate the impact of SemVer 2.0.0 packages breaking old clients, e.g. suppose a very popular package released a SemVer 2.0.0 version. In such a case a 2.x customer would fail to restore a package because the version parsing would explode. So we make SemVer 2.0.0 packages \"opt-in\". \r\n\r\nThis protocol change meant that SemVer 2.0.0 packages were hidden in most of our APIs for clients that predate NuGet version 4.3. 4.3 is when the SemVer 2.0.0 protocol was implemented. At that same time we put a warning banner on nuget.org.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94054/73881689-a223f500-4815-11ea-8717-653f6302cc65.png)\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Versioning/5.5.0-preview.2.6382\r\n\r\nA similar warning is also visible during UI upload and during package push.

In Visual Studio, this is fine because the VS update that brings the new project types also brings new versions of NuGet libraries that can restore packages for these project types.\r\n\r\nVSTS builds are unable to provide this same symmetry because we are unable to use those built-in NuGet libraries, and instead call NuGet.exe or dotnet.exe directly to do restore. This causes issues when the version of NuGet used to restore is too old to work with one or more of the projects in the user's solution. We want to avoid this issue by using the new msbuild /restore functionality, which relies solely on the installed copy of MSBuild, which in turn matches the version of Visual Studio installed on the build agents. This will mean that agents can build new project types as soon as they're updated to a new version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n## Ask\r\nHowever, msbuild /restore currently only works for .NET Core/PackageRef projects. We'd like to have its functionality extended to support both .NET paradigms (Framework/packages.config is missing). Once that's done, we can simplify the VSTS build templates for .NET project to use this built-in restore capability and avoid hard-to-debug build errors during the restore step.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/issues/5997\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/issues/6039\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/issues/5236\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/issues/5164\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/issues/5065\r\n- https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/145862/build-nuget-restore-private-feed.html\r\n- https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/158828/nuget-restore-on-private-agent-always-using-v41.html\r\n- https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/100882/nuget-restore-fails-after-aspnet-core-20-migration.html\r\n- https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/32997/hosted-agent-2017-with-nuget-35.html"},{"Id":"11456709072","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T21:50:09","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8190","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Error list shown although \"Always show Error List if build finishes with errors\" is not checked\" (#8190) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\nDeveloper Community: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/177400/error-list-shown-although-always-show-error-list-i.html\n\nNuGet causes Error List to popup during Build even when VS settings are set otherwise.\n\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\n\n1.

This project may not be fully compatible with your project.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to suppress this message, even with <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);NU1702;1702</NoWarn> in my project file (for Debug and Release builds).\r\n\r\nNU1701 can be suppressed via the props dialog for the package, but the props dialog for the project has no 'No Warn' entry field.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\nnot needed\r\n\r\n### Sample Project\r\n\r\nThis project has 2 .NET Framework projects in it - the warning shows for the new SDK formatted project, but not the other (old style format).

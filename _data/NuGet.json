I’d like to add support for NuGet’s symbol server so that profiling of NuGet packages is entirely transparent to the user. \r\n\r\nWe’re currently using dbghelp for symbol server support (SymFindFileInPath) and since NuGet’s symbol server seems to follow the regular symbol server format, I’d expected it to just work. \r\n\r\nHowever, I’m getting a 403 error for any PDBs I try to get. I know that Visual Studio does support NuGet, so I reverse engineered what that’s doing and it seems NuGet requires a SymbolChecksum header to be present for symbol server GET requests. If I manually send GET requests with this header it indeed works.\r\n\r\nI’m aware I can retrieve the checksum from the PE header, but that’s pretty inconvenient as it requires the image file to be present in order to read the checksum, which is not always the case (for example, when examining a ETW trace made on another machine). The checksum also seems redundant, since the PDB signature should already be enough to retrieve the PDB (and indeed that’s how it works in the native case). \r\n\r\nSo, I was wondering what the reasoning behind this requirement is, and if it’s possible to somehow opt out of this behaviour?\r\n\r\nNot having the requirement for this header would allow client tooling to treat NuGet’s symbol server as “just another symbol server”, rather than requiring special case handling to add the header, which seems desirable to me.\r\n\r\nAny input is appreciated!"},{"Id":"14533681978","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-15T01:09:03","Actor":"ryuyu","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8353","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[A11y]Fixing a missed horizontal scroll bar case\" (#8353) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Fixing https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1188115 being reopened."},{"Id":"14532050810","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-14T21:46:40","Actor":"lyndaidaii","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8313","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[A11y] [WCAG2.1] Two scroll bars shown on status page, when zooming in.\" (#8313) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"See this: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1221931/"},{"Id":"14532039700","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-14T21:45:34","Actor":"lyndaidaii","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8181","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[A11y][UI]No Visual representation is provided for required field 'Username' \" (#8181) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Copied from https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1184475\r\n## Browser Details:\r\nFirefox Version: 79.0 (64 bit)\r\n\r\n## OS Details\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Enterprise  ​\r\n\r\nVersion 2004 (OS Build 19041.450)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Repro Steps:\r\n\r\n    Hit the URL and login with appropriate credentials\r\n    Tab till \"Open Profile drop down\" and press enter\r\n    Tab till \"API Keys\" and Press enter\r\n    Tab till \"Create button\" and press enter\r\n    Tab till \"Key Name\" editable field\r\n    Check whether a visual representation like asterisk is provided at the required field \"Key Name\" or not \r\n\r\n## Actual Results:\r\n\r\nNo Visual representation is provided for required field 'Username'\r\n## Expected Results:\r\nVisual representation like asterisk should be provided at the required fields.\r\n## User Impact:\r\nUsers may not understand if there is no visual representation at the required fields.\r\n\r\n## Notes:\r\nThis appears to be about adding an * by required fields in forms."},{"Id":"14532023476","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-14T21:43:56","Actor":"lyndaidaii","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8184","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[A11y][ARIA]The purpose of the Learn more link is not descriptive\" (#8184) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Copied from https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1184490\r\n## Browser Details:\r\nFirefox Version: 79.0 (64 bit)\r\n\r\n## OS Details\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Enterprise  ​\r\n\r\nVersion 2004 (OS Build 19041.450)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Repro Steps:\r\n\r\n    Hit the URL and login with appropriate credentials\r\n    Tab till \"upload tab\" item and press enter\r\n    Tab till \"Verify\" drop down and press enter.\r\n    Tab till \"Learn more\" link\r\n    Check whether the purpose of the link is defined by the name of the link or not\r\n\r\n## Actual Results:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the link is not descriptive for the \"Learn more\" and \"Read more\" links\r\n\r\n   \r\n## Expected Results:\r\nThe purpose of the link should be more descriptive.

(In the mentioned repository you can find this constellation [here][1].)\r\nOf course, in this case the application raises an `FileNotFoundException` for `BaseLibrary`.\r\n\r\nSo I've added is to my NuGet package [using targets file directive][2].\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Include=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)BaseLibrary.dll\" Visible=\"false\">\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </None>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe assembly now available in the output folder, but I still get the same `FileNotFoundException`.\r\nThis seems to be new behavior in dotnetcore: Assemblies are not implicitly loaded.\r\nThe assembly is missing in `ConsoleWithNugetReference.deps.json`.\r\n\r\nTo solve this now have to [load manually before it is first used][3].\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar location = Path.GetDirectoryName(typeof(Program).Assembly.Location);\r\nAssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath(Path.Combine(location!, \"BaseLibrary.dll\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll this is very complicated and tedious!\r\n\r\nSo, how can I define a NuGet package that contains two assemblies, one that is directly referenced by the consumer of my package and another one that is only needed at runtime and its APIs should not be visible to the consumer?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/lg2de/NuGetDependencyDemo/tree/11962aa812a566efbb5782876692ebb1df574fa9\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/lg2de/NuGetDependencyDemo/commit/0d67ebaf3648d06322844f03a99609dd642506b7\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/lg2de/NuGetDependencyDemo/commit/e2dbc8c0265217164f4022347f1c7e65125e4c7a"},{"Id":"14537731092","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-15T09:32:34","Actor":"v-longmin","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10380","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The default version is null after clicking a deprecated package in Browse tab\" (#10380) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\nVS Version: D16.9\\30808.132\r\nNuGet Version: dev-feature-OE.PMUI\\5.9.0.13982\r\nOS Version: Windows-10-Enterprise-19H2.\r\n## Installation\r\n1.

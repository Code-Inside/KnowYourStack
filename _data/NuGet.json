So, every time NuGet wants to add a new MSBuild item, we need to create a new iterface for the new item type, publish the package, then edit dotnet/project-system to use the new package and set the new property for the item.\r\n\r\nProject properties and item metadata already use a generic property bag, which is more or less equivalent to `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string>` (but is different for COM compatibility). Items should also use a generic data structure, so that future additions to which MSBuild items NuGet reads no longer requires project system to update package versions to implement the change."},{"Id":"38583003712","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-21T20:21:39","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13454","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGetAuditLevel is not respected with packages.config projects when restoring with msbuild -t:restore \" (#13454) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"38239602212","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-09T16:12:01","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/72","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as April 8th, 2024\" (#72) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as April 8th, 2024.

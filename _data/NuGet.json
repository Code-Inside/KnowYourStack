I didn't seem to download a version, so I wonder if my machine was automatically patched?\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nContext:\r\nIt was working fine and dandy before, and all of a sudden, today I ran into an Error, which was thrown because I TreatWarningsAsErrors. So as far as I know, I didn't do any upgrades, or anything. \r\n\r\nHere's what I'm doing:\r\nI'm building a convention and uniform library solution, in which I have \"Assembly Annotations\" that help dictate things.\r\n\r\nSome examples of what the convention and configuration does:\r\n* if a package has the \"MyAssemblyType\" of \"PackageAssembly\", then msbuild will create a new Attribute called \"PackageAssemblyIntroAttribute\" that includes \"Id\" and \"Version\".\r\n* if it's a PackageAssembly, then the Author is me.\r\n* Includes custom targets\r\n\r\nSo what happened:\r\n* I'm now getting warnings and errors out the wazoo which is incredibly breaking for my workflow, since I need to either turn off TreatWarningsAsErrors, or individually address each one. Most of which I've seen so far don't even make any sense.\r\n\r\nFor example, the base Assembly Annotations library, it has been stable and untouched for the last month. I ran into an issue today and decided to run \"dotnet pack\" against it, and get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.400\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(2364,5): warning MSB3277: Found conflicts between different versions of \"System.Collections.Immutable\" that could not be resolved.

Because of that, your application receives the transitive NETStandard.Library/1.6.1 package dependency which itself brings in a ton other framework dependencies and some of these might even have a known vulnerability (i.e. System.Runtime/4.3.0).\r\n\r\nTo minimize the dependency graph and not bring these out-of-support and vulnerable dependencies into the closure, we define a PackageReference to NETStandard.Library/2.0.3 which results in it being preferred over the transitive NETStandard.Library/1.6.1 package and a trimmed dependency graph (NETStandard.Library/2.0.3 has a single dependency only).\r\n\r\nThis is achieved via the following: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ba0d5f41c25357e375927bab28ce268262bf22ca/eng/testing/xunit/xunit.targets#L3-L6\r\n\r\nNow with CPM enabled, implicitly referenced packages can't be bumped anymore as the unsuppressable `NU1009` error is raised. The alternative of disabling CPM is not possible as that affects every project that has a (transitive or direct) package dependency on NETStandard.Library/1.6.1. These days such projects are mostly test projects in our stack which use xunit or Shouldly but those are hundreds in runtime and still a lot in msbuild.\r\n\r\nCPM should warn about such cases but not error or offer a way to suppress it. As an alternative, to provide a work around for similar issues that might arise in the future, it might help to allow specifying the `VersionOverride` attribute on the PackageReference item without a corresponding `PackageVersion` item.\r\n\r\ncc @jeffkl "},{"Id":"28571987027","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-21T08:48:36","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12289","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Warn when vulnerabilities are detected during PackageReference restore \" (#12289) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"28561164699","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-20T20:09:56","Actor":"dtivel","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11262","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Signing:  re-enable signed package verification on Linux and macOS\" (#11262) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"[Design specification](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/signed-package-verification/re-enable-signed-package-verification.md)\r\n[Technical specification](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/signed-package-verification/re-enable-signed-package-verification-technical.md)"},{"Id":"28557384426","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-20T17:06:06","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12547","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Screen readers not detecting elements in NuGet Solver window\" (#12547) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"28557365186","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-20T17:05:15","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12547","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Screen readers not detecting elements in NuGet Solver window\" (#12547) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"28552608267","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-20T14:07:07","Actor":"chrisdecker1201","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12546","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Authentication behaviour changing depending on Basic Auth or CredentialProvider\" (#12546) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.0.407\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use this version\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nI think I've everything described here: https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider/issues/383, but it seems no problem from the CredentialProvider.\r\n\r\nWe use the following systems:\r\n\r\n* Azure DevOps Pipelines\r\n\r\n* external Feed (ProGet from Inedo https://inedo.com/proget)\r\n\r\n* self hosted build agents (Windows Server 2022)\r\n\r\nWe have the following issue:\r\n\r\nI can't get the restore running with the external feed, if I use the CredentialProvider.

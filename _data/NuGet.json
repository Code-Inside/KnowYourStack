===================\r\n```\r\nHad hundreds of different versions of nuget packages in my local repository, and everything was working perfectly, once I was playing and updating some of the nugets the happened.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, there was nothing on the internet.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most irritating errors I got, cause don't know, and can't guess what really may happened and what could be the issue, the most probable solution remained that I can guess could be to restart windows, after clearing every possible cache.\r\nDon't know Nuget from where and how generate those wrong contents repeatedly.\r\n\r\nEarlier there was a project that I was forced to start it from the ground up.\r\nFor another project Nuget repeatedly was setting the location of the contents somewhere else, and got forced to add a Nuspec file to let it know where is the exact target location though I set it ealier in the .csproj file.\r\n\r\nI could have made more issue/bug report here, but now was able to post one after seeing some kind of behavior repeatedly which these are really irritating.\r\n\r\nUsing Visual Studio latest version, built the packages via VS build menu.\r\nProjects are as simple as:\r\n\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <!-- <TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp3.1;netstandard2.0;netstandard2.1;netcoreapp3.0;net472</TargetFrameworks> -->\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n// with some contents like the ones posted earlier.\r\n```"},{"Id":"12936747235","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-17T14:02:21","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9813","RelatedDescription":"Opened

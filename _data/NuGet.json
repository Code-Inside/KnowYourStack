The .NET Foundation board and project committee would like to relax that requirement so that users only have to have valid signing certificates from a trusted root authority\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nGet rid of the problematic rules that are limiting our users from maintaining their packages. The current restrictions are causing users to remove the dotnetfoundation as an owner of the package so they can provide their own signing certificates. Having packages in the foundation signed gives some assurance to our users but allows our maintainers flexibility to sign as needed.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nHas been a pain to test azure trusted signing for the foundation. I hit this limitation with sign users myself and had to remove the dotnetfoundation owner and add myself as owner to allow tests to proceed.\r\n\r\nI know other project leads have removed the foundation owner themselves to let them do their own signing.\r\n\r\nSome maintainers are doing it since they want a fully linux approach for example and the current requirements doesn't give them flexibility."},{"Id":"42036003992","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T10:33:39","Actor":"Giorgi","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10186","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: Target framework not shown in the listing\" (#10186) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

If another actor has updated the version list since it was read, an HTTP 412 is thrown causing the operation to fail and the job to crash. This is fine because the job will quickly retry and be fine this time (probably).\r\n\r\nIn the case of Catalog2AzureSearch, the amount of work that is re-done is very small. A couple of catalog leaves.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Auxiliary2AzureSearch, the amount of work that is re-done can be very large. If the downloads.v1.json file has changes, this could be thousands of documents that need new download counts. It's not great to start over.\r\n\r\n### Basic example\r\n\r\nSuppose the downloads.v1.json file has changed and Auxiliary2AzureSearch is chomping through the diff pushing all of the new download counts to Azure Search. \r\n\r\nAlso suppose a package owner has pushed a new version of one of the download counts that changed.\r\n\r\nIf Catalog2AzureSearch updates the version list around the same time as Auxiliary2AzureSearch running, Auxiliary2AzureSearch can fail because it sees the version list has changed.\r\n\r\n### Easy fix\r\n\r\nMake the jobs catch the failure and retry one or two times for the set of packages that failed with HTTP 412.\r\n\r\n### Exception text\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Job Failed to Run\": \"Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.StorageException: The remote server returned an

No, this has always been broken for long as I can remember.\r\n\r\n## Repro steps\r\n1. Open VS and open Package Manager Console. Make sure you don't load any custom PowerShell profile in PMC.\r\n2. From VS, all of the following will show a console window\r\na. start a debug session of a .net framework console app\r\nb. start a debug session of a dotnet core console app\r\nc. start Developer Command Prompt from tools meny\r\nd. start Developer PowerShell from tools menu\r\nc. run \"Open Command Prompt\" from the \"Power Commands\" extension\r\n3. In PMC, invoke any command which results in executing a console programe, e.g. ``cmd /c echo test``\r\n4. Now try any of the items from step 2, all are broken and don't show a console window.\r\n\r\nCalling the following PInvoke function in PMC unblocks new console windows created after that, until another console command is invoked in PMC.\r\n```\r\n[DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode, SetLastError = true)]\r\npublic static extern bool FreeConsole();\r\n```\r\nSince git is called from my prompt function that means every time I run anything.\r\nOf course one can work around this issue by freeing the console at the end of the PowerShell prompt function. It would be better if PMC did this automatically, allocating the console (if needed) and hiding it at the start of a command and and freeing it again at the end after the prompt has been invoked. PMC should be able to do this since it is already aware of when a command starts/ends and disables/enables menus etc in VS."},{"Id":"12651126882","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-16T23:19:18","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9693","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Avoid reading the assets file in no-op restores\" (#9693) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"12651024365","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-16T23:01:12","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9692","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Check Security Tenet status\" (#9692) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Investigate the AzDO tasks assigned to me that ask us to check some Security points in our codebase."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"12582399620","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-09T17:20:40","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/45","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"CVE-2020-1340 - NuGet Gallery Spoofing Vulnerability\" (#45) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"A spoofing vulnerability exists when the NuGet Gallery does not properly sanitize input on package metadata values.

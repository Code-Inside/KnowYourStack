For example, there could be a \"Move to Directory.Packages.props file\" option accessed from the context menu on the installed package in the solution explorer that would create an entry into the Directory.Packages.props file and remove the version from the one in the csproj (or only the last part if the package was already in the props file.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the version would differ from the one in the props file, a prompt could confirm if we wish to overwrite with the selected version, use the one from the props file, or cancel\r\n\r\nThere are probably cases I didn't cover, but the general idea is there and I'm sure we'd benefit from having this option.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"21309891667","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-15T17:15:00","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11752","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Epic]: Additional central package management features for the next release\" (#11752) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"These items need to be addressed to make central package management production ready.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\nTake performance measurements for large repositories to ensure that there is no regression in restore times.  Also look for any optimizations that can be made.\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10256\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9740\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9740\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nAdd additional requested features and ease migration pain when migrating to NuGet's CPM from implementations like Microsoft.Build.CentralPackageVersions.\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10159\r\n  [Microsoft.Build.CentralPackageVersions](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks/tree/main/src/CentralPackageVersions) has this handy \"global\" package feature that is syntactic sugar for adding a package reference to every project in the tree.  It essentially turns this:  \r\n  ```xml\r\n     <GlobalPackageReference Include=\"Some.Build.Package\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  ```\r\n  Into this:\r\n  ```xml\r\n      <PackageReference Include=\"Some.Build.Package\" Version=\"1.0.0\" IncludeAssets=\"Analyzers,Build\" PrivateAssets=\"All\" />\r\n  ```\r\n  Which ensures that \"global\" package references are only used for build logic and don't spill into upstream dependencies.  These kind of packages are just used by every project in the repository but aren't a compile-time asset.\r\n  Having this feature in NuGet's CPM will greatly ease migrations from [Microsoft.Build.CentralPackageVersions](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks/tree/main/src/CentralPackageVersions)\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11715\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9467\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nKnown issues to fix before we remove the experimental flag:\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11724\r\n  Fixed by not logging the message\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10311 \r\n  Packages pinned transitively don't respect their parent's metadata\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10126\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11715\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10432\r\n\r\n## Migration\r\n- [ ] No one location to specify metadata like `NoWarn`\r\n  Since [Microsoft.Build.CentralPackageVersions](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks/tree/main/src/CentralPackageVersions) uses the `Update` guesture, it lets users specify a version for a package as well as other metadata like `NoWarn`.  However, in NuGet's CPM we only have a `<PackageVersion />` item and it wouldn't make sense to specify `NoWarn` on a package version.  Users will need to add a `<PackageReference Update=\"\" NoWarn=\"1234\" />` to their `Directory.Packages.props`.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"21309517846","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-15T16:40:14","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11746","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGet Package Manager window causes persistent WPF frame rate spike due to a runaway animation\" (#11746) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"See details in the internal issue, [1496338](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_queries/edit/1496338). \r\n\r\nThis is a consequence of a bug in WPF, where an animation does not get stop despite it being not visible."},{"Id":"21309513331","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-15T16:39:48","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11744","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGet.Commands.FuncTest.RestoreCommandTests.RestoreCommand_FrameworkImport_WarnOnAsync is flaky\" (#11744) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"It's flaky, likely becausen it depends on NuGet.org.\r\n\r\nIn similar ilk like some recent fixes, we should rewrite this test to work without nuget.org."},{"Id":"21309506072","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-15T16:39:07","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11745","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disable flaky test: PushCommand_PushToServer_WhenPluginReturnsAbort_ThrowsAndDoesNotFallBackToConsoleProvider\" (#11745) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"21301711384","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-15T04:43:54","Actor":"alibyek","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11751","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Readme.md \" (#11751) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Readme.md "},{"Id":"21297778057","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-14T21:01:11","Actor":"kartheekp-ms","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11750","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package manager UI should be only updated only when there is an important state change\" (#11750) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Track https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4535#discussion_r848924794.

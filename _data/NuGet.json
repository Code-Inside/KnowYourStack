This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet. Packaging versions). If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET SDKs.\r\n\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.8.0 or lower, you should download and install 6.8.1 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.8.1/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.7.0 or lower, you should download and install 6.7.1 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.7.1/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.6.1 or lower, you should download and install 6.6.2 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.6.2/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.4.2 or lower, you should download and install 6.4.3 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.4.3/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.3.3 or lower, you should download and install 6.3.4 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.3.4/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 6.0.5 or lower, you should download and install 6.0.6 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v6.0.6/nuget.exe.\r\n- If you're using NuGet.exe 5.11.5 or lower, you should download and install 5.11.6 from https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v5.11.6/nuget.exe.\r\n\r\nYou can get the version of NuGet.exe by running the `nuget` command. You should see an output like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNuGet Version: 6.0.0.280\r\n\r\nusage: NuGet <command> [args] [options]\r\n\r\nType 'NuGet help <command>' for help on a specific command.\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n\r\n  https://www.nuget.org/downloads\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You should see an output like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.102 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n- If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install SDK 7.0.116 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4), or SDK 7.0.313 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.6), or 7.0.406 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.7) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n- If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install SDK 6.0.127 or SDK 6.0.419 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.3) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed self-contained applications targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

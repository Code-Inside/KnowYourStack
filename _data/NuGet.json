Client handles this differently based on whether -SkipDuplicate is provided as part of the push.\r\n\r\n**snupkg behavior:** snupkg duplicates can sometimes behaves differently than nupkg duplicates (as is the case with nuget.org):\r\n\r\n- If a snupkg already exists when pushed,  nuget.org will simply overwrite it, validation will be re-ran on this snupkg, and a success response (HTTP-201) is returned. \r\n\r\n- A special case is if server validation is currently executing on this snupkg (as it does immediately after a push), another push of the snupkg causes the server to return this duplicate error:\r\n\r\n`Response status code does not indicate success: 409 (It looks like there is another copy of this symbols package pending validation(s). Please wait for the validation(s) to finish before trying to replace the symbols package.).`\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt should be discussed whether nuget.org should continue overwriting snupkgs when they are pushed. At a minimum, the existing experience is inconsistent with nupkgs.\r\n\r\nSome initial thoughts and discussion points:\r\n**Minimal use-case:** The (only?) scenario where updating (\"patching\") an existing snupkg is if you didn't include all the PDBs in the original snupkg, and subsequently added them. Is this scenario common? Should we require them to Delete their symbols through \"Delete Symbols\" button on nuget.org before they can then push the snupkg again without a 409 Conflict?\r\n\r\n**Version guidance:** Assumption here is that we prefer to not require a new package version when adding additional symbols to a snupkg. Thus, a user can incrementally fill a snupkg with PDBs as long as they don't modify the DLL.\r\n\r\n**Server workload concern:**  pushing N nupkgs (say N=100) will involuntarily update <=100 snupkgs and trigger <=100 validations of symbols that have already been through validation (assuming this trigger happens even if there are no changes to the snupkg). \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nNuGet Client Issue where this discussion came up: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8148\r\nDiscussion that lead to this issue by: @cristinamanum, @karann-msft, @rrelyea, @donnie-msft "},{"Id":"10794864003","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-05T23:01:12","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7680","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Lightning does not treat package IDs as case insensitive\" (#7680) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"This in rare cases could lead to concurrency issues when two workers are updating the same hive at the same time.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Services.Metadata/blob/e921a7eef360ee6bcc11b7ca9f94d96e93193a1c/src/Ng/Jobs/LightningJob.cs#L262"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"10804351375","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-06T21:58:15","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8796","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The Visual Studio NuGet packages (RestoreManagerPackage and NuGetPackage packages) needs to auto load on solution build events\" (#8796) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"See https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/792876. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a thread: \r\n\r\nWe had a discussion on this and decided the proper way to do this is to whitelist the SolutionBuilding UI context for sync autoload. \r\n\r\nAfter the UI context is whitelisted, nuget will have to add the following into the package definition:\r\n[ProvideAutoLoad(VSConstants.UICONTEXT.SolutionBuilding_string)]\r\n\r\nNote that there should be no PackageAutoLoadFlags.BackgroundLoad flag in this registration.

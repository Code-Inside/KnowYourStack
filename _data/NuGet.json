It is relatively simple to fall into this case because our docs used to suggest the push URL being \"https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package\" and at a cursory glance this may look like the V2 feed URL. Also, if you want to `nuget.exe push -source <name>` you need to add the push URL as a source, which works for push but breaks in VS:\r\n\r\nWe could simplify this by redirecting allow `PUT` at `https://www.nuget.org/api/v2`. This is very simple because it's one URL.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94054/57956249-3a0b3880-78ad-11e9-94ef-8a1c21778c04.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[V2Push] The V2 feed at 'https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Search()?$filter=IsAbsoluteLatestVersion&searchTerm=''&targetFramework='net472'&includePrerelease=true&$skip=0&$top=26&semVerLevel=2.0.0' returned an unexpected status code '400 The format of the package id is invalid'.\r\n``\r\n\r\nWe could also redirect `GET https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/*` to `GET https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/*` but this is complicated with the .nupkg download URL so maybe less achievable."},{"Id":"9648777840","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-05-17T17:13:14","Actor":"cristinamanum","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7145","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Remove the old search.\" (#7145) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"There are two changes in this PR:\r\n1.

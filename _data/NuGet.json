A fix would be nice\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n1. Table in README markdown looks ugly if some column contains a long text due to word wrap that breaks words in other columns even inside the inline code block. Compare rendered tables: Nuget https://www.nuget.org/packages/GlobRegex vs Github https://github.com/dscheg/GlobRegex\r\nGithub markdown looks good even on narrow screens. CSS to fix issue:\r\n```css\r\n.readme-common .table {\r\n  overflow: auto;\r\n  display: block;\r\n  word-break: normal;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. It might be better to have a horizontal scroll and turn off word wrap inside multiline code blocks, because it seems such code is hard to read, given that there are no line numbers and display of hyphens: it is not always clear whether the EOL is in the code itself or word wraping has been applied. The same example links above. CSS to fix issue: `pre code { white-space: pre; }` instead of `pre code { white-space: pre-wrap; }`\r\n\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nCreate readme for the package with:\r\n1. Table with 3 columns with a long text inside the middle column\r\n2. Multiple long lines inside multiline code block\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. Table looks good even with long text in some column\r\n2. Multiline code blocks are easy to read even with long lines\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/1962268/513789fc-7d62-452b-9a10-e2e6607af536)\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"30045861526","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T19:01:45","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9530","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"FI main to dev\" (#9530) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Bringing back binding redirect fix."},{"Id":"30021470111","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T00:04:35","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9530","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"FI main to dev\" (#9530) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Bringing back binding redirect fix."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"30277621381","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-07-07T21:24:12","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11377","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Design Package Source mapping package experiences for VS Options Dialog\" (#11377) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Follow up to #6867 and #10660, child of https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10730. \r\n\r\nThe MVP covers the VS Options dialog experience for the most part."},{"Id":"30277215694","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-07-07T20:57:50","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11361","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Package Source Mapping UI - Add Package Source Mapping in the NuGet Options UI\" (#11361) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"This issue captures *all* the additions for `Package Source Mapping` in the NuGet Options UI. \r\n\r\nNote that this does not include the package manager UI, that's a different task. \r\n\r\nThis issue captures creating clarity and ensuring the spec is up to date with whatever gets implemented. \r\n\r\nRefer to the design here: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/dev/implemented/2021/PackageSourceMapping.md\r\n\r\nAs of right now, the design doc seems pretty complete. \r\n\r\nSome potential questions.\r\n\r\n* How do you onboard to source mapping using the UX (ex. enabling the feature).\r\n\r\ncc @JonDouglas \r\n\r\nDesign primarily captured in https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11377\r\n\r\n- [x] https://github.com/nuget/home/issues/11362\r\n- [x] https://github.com/nuget/home/issues/11363\r\n- [x] https://github.com/nuget/home/issues/11364\r\n- [x] https://github.com/NuGet/Client.Engineering/issues/1834\r\n- [x] https://github.com/NuGet/Client.Engineering/issues/1691\r\n- [x] https://github.com/NuGet/docs.microsoft.com-nuget/issues/2799\r\n- [x] https://github.com/NuGet/Client.Engineering/issues/2034\r\n- [x] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12271\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12155"},{"Id":"30274969126","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-07-07T18:42:29","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12464","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGet.Commands.LockFileBuilder  KeyNotFoundException Exception\" (#12464) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\ndotnet 7.0.201; nuget 6.5.0.136\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\ndotnet 7.0.101; nuget 6.4.0.117\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\n# Error\r\n\r\n- 7.0.201 sdk results in **System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException** exception during dotnet restore\r\n- Exception during NuGet.Commands.LockFileBuilder.GetLibraryDependenciesForCentralTransitiveDependencies call\r\n- Cannot duplicate on windows docker build but repeatedly on Jenkins server instance\r\n- Always fails on same library System.Runtime.InteropServices which has been downloaded per logs and file listing at end.\r\n\r\n# Failure Setup - Docker build\r\n\r\nFrom mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0.201-bullseye-slim\r\n\r\nStep 13/57 : RUN dotnet nuget --version\r\nNuGet Command Line\r\n6.5.0.136\r\nStep 14/57 : RUN dotnet --version\r\n7.0.201\r\n\r\nStep 56/57 : RUN dotnet restore -v diag \"Source/src/spc/SpcService/SpcService.csproj\"\r\n\r\n## Exception Details\r\n\r\n```\r\n21:07:13.724     1>/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/7.0.201/NuGet.targets(132,5): error : The given key 'System.Runtime.InteropServices' was not present in the dictionary.

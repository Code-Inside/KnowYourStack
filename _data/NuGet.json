It's an ASP.NET Web Application project and it has 35 modules and 1 `.sln` file. Each module has 5 class library projects and is located under its folder. Modules depend on each other via project references. I have to say that there is a dependency hell that makes development difficult.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm replacing these project references with nuget references and am creating nuget package for every projects and `.sln` file for every module so that developers can focus on their modules and work on small projects instead of a huge monolithic. My aim is to increase dependency between modules with using messaging queue or streaming in the future. In that scenario I'll remove nuget references from projects but, I can't say when it'll be possible.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm creating 5 nuget packages for one module and install these packages to ASP.NET Web Application project. After every commit, I create a new version of nuget packages with commit id like `1.0.0-beta.1871248`. It seems that I'll be in trouble with this versioning, because I want every module and web application project to work with latest versions of other modules. In order to do that, developers need to update nuget packages in Visual Studio Package Manager. And right there I have to say that there is a version hell :) To solve this problem, I've decided to create nuget packages with only one specific version like `1.0.0-beta` and [reinstall ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/reinstalling-and-updating-packages) every packages during build from Visual Studio but there is no easy way to achieve this.\r\n \r\nIt seems that [Package restore in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore#enable-and-disable-package-restore-in-visual-studio) does not use MSBuild targets. It would be easier if there were some MSBuild targets for that purpose, I could override one of them and just delete packages folder before restoring. So, here is my workaround:\r\n\r\nI've disabled automatically check for missing packages during build in Visual Studio with adding `automatic` key to `NuGet.Config` to avoid double installation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n  <packageSources>\r\n    <clear />\r\n    <add key=\"nuget.org-proxy\" value=\"http://internal-nexus/repository/nuget.org-proxy/\" />\r\n    <add key=\"nuget-hosted\" value=\"http://internal-nexus/repository/nuget-hosted/\" />\r\n    <add key=\"automatic\" value=\"False\" />\r\n  </packageSources>\r\n  <disabledPackageSources>\r\n    <add key=\"nuget.org\" value=\"true\" />\r\n    <add key=\"Microsoft and .NET\" value=\"true\" />\r\n  </disabledPackageSources>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've added new target to `.csproj` file to delete packages folder and reinstall packages. I'm doing this for only debug mode because my CI/CD pipeline never gets packages folder from source control. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<Target Name=\"DeletePackagesFolderTarget\" BeforeTargets=\"Build\" Condition=\"'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'\">\r\n  <Exec Command=\"rd /s /q $(SolutionDir)\\packages\" />\r\n  <Exec Command=\"$(SolutionDir)\\nuget\\nuget.exe restore $(SolutionPath)\" />\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could make it happen by just adding a key to `NuGet.Config`. It would be perfect if I could set it for one package source.\r\n\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console):\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): 4.9.2.5706\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): Enterprise 2017 Version 15.9.14\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): win10 v1703\r\n\r\nWorked before?

Information is sparse, sometimes contradictory, and the lack of details on some concepts like TFMs makes the task nearly impossible. This whole thing could really use some detailed documenting and samples.\r\n\r\nIn no particular order:\r\n\r\n## Target frameworks\r\n\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/target-frameworks has a long list of supported frameworks, but `native` is not included, as reported in NuGet/docs.microsoft.com-nuget#1480. However https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/native-support/ clearly states that:\r\n  > When targeting native projects, a new target framework name is now recognized: **native**.\r\n\r\n- This page lists `netcore` as a framework with versions like `5.0`. But .NET Core is just releasing its 3.0 this week. So clearly there is no relation between the two, but there is not a word on it.\r\n\r\n- This page also casually mentions the TFM `win10`:\r\n  > win10 (not supported by Windows 10 Platform)\r\n\r\n  There is no explanation on what `win10` is (is this Desktop, as opposed to UWP?) nor why `win10` would not be supported on Windows 10 despite the name clearly saying otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Package structure\r\n\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package goes into details about the NuGet package structure, but does not mention anything about native DLLs.\r\n\r\n- https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/native-support/ says that the `build/` folder should be used to put the native DLLs, but https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package says it is only for `.targets` and `.props` files.\r\n\r\n- https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/native-support/ says that the `build/` folder respects target frameworks, but does that mean that `build/native/x86/my.dll` vs. `build/native/x64/my.dll` works? Or should architecture-specific native DLLs be put in `runtimes/`?\r\n\r\n- Does NuGet support Desktop (Win32) and UWP inside the same package? I could not find any documentation about that. I tried using `runtimes\\win10-x86\\native\\my.dll` for the Desktop variant, and `runtimes\\win10-x86\\lib\\uap10.0\\my.dll` for the UWP variant of the native DLL, but I get an error _error APPX1101: Payload contains two or more files with the same destination path_. Why is that? Those are different frameworks, why is NuGet trying to import both files into a UWP project?\r\n\r\n## P/Invoke\r\n\r\nIt seems many people have problem with deploying architecture-specific native DLLs. A quick search on nuget.org shows that [packages like Microsoft.Net.Native.Compiler have many \"runtime\" variants](https://www.nuget.org/packages/runtime.win10-x64.Microsoft.Net.Native.Compiler/2.2.7-rel-27913-00) starting with _e.g._ a `runtime.win10-x64.` prefix, but it doesn't seem there is documentation about this approach.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Mizux/dotnet-native attempts to provide an example using [the undocumented `runtime.json`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/pkg/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/runtime.json) used by CoreFX, but looking at the example it seems that for each native DLL variant, a specific .NET Standard 2.0 wrapper assembly is needed, instead of using a single one with multiple native DLLs. This sounds very cumbersome, is that the only option?\r\n\r\nRelated to that, if it is possible to use a single .NET Standard 2.0 assembly, then how to deploy the correct native DLL? With a .NET Core 3.0 sample app, it seems that currently NuGet copies the entire `runtimes/` folder inside the `bin/` folder of the app, instead of only the appropriate native DLL. This results in multiple copies, and of course the wrong DLL path which prevents `DllImport` from finding the native DLL.\r\n\r\n## Other issues\r\n\r\nThere are many other logged issues that seem partially related:\r\n- #6645 mentions that\r\n  >  runtimes/{rid}/native does not work with netfx\r\n\r\n  but there is no context about where that comes from. And it suggests putting native DLLs in `lib/` which is reserved for assemblies, so doesn't seem to be a correct solution.\r\n- #6648 closed as duplicate, although the context is not clear (what kind of app / platform is this about?)\r\n- #3931 seems to be somewhat related, but uses `project.json` (?)\r\n- #2350 asks about the P/Invoke and packaging issue, but was closed without answer.\r\n- #6846 touches on the deploy problem when consuming the package\r\n- #8573, #8435, #1221, #5606, ... I didn't read all of them, there are too many.\r\n- Several issues mention https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49162127/how-to-include-native-assets-in-nuget-on-multiple-platforms-only-64-bit but this seems to be only a subset of the issues, it is not clear how this scales to multiple architectures AND multiple platforms at the same time. It also seems to suggest multiple assemblies are needed.\r\n- The road of the [`AssemblyLoadContext`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/design-docs/assemblyloadcontext.md) seems to be a runtime solution to a packaging problem, and really not a path I want to get onto.\r\n"},{"Id":"10479694292","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:17:27","Actor":"Falconne","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8622","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"\"nuget.exe list\" filtering on search terms no longer works\" (#8622) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"`nuget list [search terms]` functionality allows searching for NuGet packages from the command line.

We still want a binding redirect generated for it in 4.0, but not for 4.5.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI followed the exact same steps above, but there's no binding redirect added to the Console Application.

I should do a PR shortly to address this one.\r\n\r\nThe place where it is referenced is RuntimeHelper.cs:150\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe're hitting an issue with Microsoft.Bcl package where NuGet is adding a binding redirect for a binary that is considered part of the framework, this causes the application to crash because the binding redirect refers to assembly version that is not available at runtime.\r\n\r\n@Repro:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Console Application targeting 4.5\r\n2. Create a new Portable Library targeting .NET Framework 4.5, Silverlight 4, Windows Phone 7.5 and .NET for Windows Store apps\r\n3. Add a reference to the portable library from the Console Application\r\n4. Install the Microsoft.Bcl package (1.0.16-rc) to both projects\r\n\r\n@Expected: No binding redirect for System.Runtime in the .NET Framework 4.5 project because a ___later version___ is part of the target framework (see C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETFramework\\v4.5\\RedistList\\FrameworkList.xml)\r\n@Actual: Binding redirect\r\n\r\n<dependentAssembly>\r\n<assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Runtime\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n<bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-1.5.11.0\" newVersion=\"1.5.11.0\" />\r\n</dependentAssembly>\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use the IVsFrameworkMultiTargeting to determine if a given assembly version is available as part of a given target framework.\r\nMake sure when you fix this, that you only skip the binding redirect if ___a later or same version___ is available in the framework.  \r\n2013-02-22\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe'll do this in 2.4 release.  \r\n2013-02-26\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIs IVsFrameworkMultiTargeting.IsReferenceableInTargetFx the method I need to call?

It can either contain all the information (key, version, etc), or just the simple name (\"mscorlib\")  \r\n2013-06-10\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo look like I can only check for the same version of the target framework.

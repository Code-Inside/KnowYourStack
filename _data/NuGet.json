The intention was that a user could override built-in SDKs with their own or we could ship official SDKs as NuGet packages.  However, after years of this SDK infrastructure being available, it is extremely unlikely we'll be changing how SDKs are shipped.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nInstead, we should make the NuGet-based MSBuild project SDK resolver run _after_ the .NET SDK resolver so that if a user is using a built-in SDK like `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` then its resolved faster.  There is a bit of overhead with the NuGet-based MSBuild project SDK resolver so avoiding it when we know the SDK is just built-in is a win for customers.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"20084723400","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-04T22:35:50","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11560","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: CPVM: Directory.Packages.props Imports aren't being respected\" (#11560) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe, MSBuild.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\ndotnet 6.0.1, nuget 6.0.0.280, msbuild 16.11.1+3e40a09f8\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nI have an existing code base that used a combination of `Directory.Build.targets` files to achieve a pre-cursor to what CPVM does.\r\nThe main repo folder has one such file with a bunch of `<PackageReference Update=\"A\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />` directives and each solution/project that needs to specialize/override anything has their own copy with **an import directive to the baseline file**, i.e. `<Import Project=\"../Directory.Build.targets\" />`.\r\n\r\nWhen migrating that codebase to use CPVM, I followed the same pattern with the `Directory.Packages.props` files, assuming the `Import` will apply in the same order and behavior.\r\n\r\nThis seems to not be the case, As the baseline version of a package \"wins\" over the nearest version defined in an inner `props` file.\r\n\r\nI've made a simple repro to showcase the issue with Newtonsoft.Json v12 and v13, Where i try to use a type that only exists in the latter in one project.\r\n\r\n**Expected**: The build completes successfully, Meaning the project with the specific `Directory.Packages.props` with v13 was applied properly.\r\n\r\n**Actual**: The build failes on the missing type, Meaning the baseline v12 was applied.\r\n\r\nSteps to repro:\r\n\r\n1. Checkout the repo @ https://github.com/ransagy/TestCPVMHierarchy\r\n2. Try to build the repo with `dotnet build`\r\n3. Note the failure, Remove the `Import` directive from `Console\\Directory.Packages.props`\r\n4. Build again, This time it passes successfully.\r\n\r\nI know there is an open issue on version overriding specifically for CPVM, But i didn't feel this comes from the same source.\r\n\r\nThere is an `msbuild.log` file in the repro that is the output of `dotnet build` in my case as an example.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1488563020074737670","CreatedAt":"2022-02-01T17:20:54+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"NuGet is celebrating 20 years of @dotnet with over 290,000 unique packages and 160 billion downloads to date!

My best guess is that these tests are run in the same process and that there is a little lag between setting (or removing) environment variables and them becoming effective.  The result is that an environment variable set in a previous test leaks over into the next test.  Eventually, environment variables get unset, but not when we expect them to.\r\n\r\nI've only observed this behavior on macOS."},{"Id":"24508287496","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-10-10T18:35:41","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12143","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: Starred packages still show in the “Browse” tab after uninstalling the NuGetRecommender\" (#12143) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\nRelease-6.0.x\\6.0.2.26\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

I have no idea what changed. I didn't seem to download a version, so I wonder if my machine was automatically patched?\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt's astronomically more difficult to complete my work, everything that packaged up nicely with a bow just stopped working.\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\nContext:\r\nIt was working fine and dandy before, and all of a sudden, today I ran into an Error, which was thrown because I TreatWarningsAsErrors. So as far as I know, I didn't do any upgrades, or anything. \r\n\r\nHere's what I'm doing:\r\nI'm building a convention and uniform library solution, in which I have \"Assembly Annotations\" that help dictate things.\r\n\r\nSome examples of what the convention and configuration does:\r\n* if a package has the \"MyAssemblyType\" of \"PackageAssembly\", then msbuild will create a new Attribute called \"PackageAssemblyIntroAttribute\" that includes \"Id\" and \"Version\".\r\n* if it's a PackageAssembly, then the Author is me.\r\n* Includes custom targets\r\n\r\nSo what happened:\r\n* I'm now getting warnings and errors out the wazoo which is incredibly breaking for my workflow, since I need to either turn off TreatWarningsAsErrors, or individually address each one. Most of which I've seen so far don't even make any sense.\r\n\r\nFor example, the base Assembly Annotations library, it has been stable and untouched for the last month. I ran into an issue today and decided to run \"dotnet pack\" against it, and get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.400\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(2364,5): warning MSB3277: Found conflicts between different versions of \"System.Collections.Immutable\" that could not be resolved.

I read from the blog post that precedence rules would be applied for specific values down to wildcards so I thought hey, that's neat. I can specify NuGet as a catch-all and then specify some more specific patterns that also apply to NuGet.  That way if I ever want to change the source, the block is already there and just needs a key change.\r\n\r\nI had tried doing this:\r\n```xml\r\n<packageSourceMapping>\r\n  <packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n    <package pattern=\"**\"/>\r\n  </packageSource>\r\n  <packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n    <package pattern=\"Microsoft.*\"/>\r\n  </packageSource>\r\n</packageSourceMapping>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI saved the file and immediately Visual Studio locked up with the following error:\r\n> NuGet operation failed\r\n> PackageSourceMapping is enabled and there are multiple package sources associated with the same key(s) (and then a path to the file)\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nA gold error bar should show up in Visual Studio calling out the issue, but it absolutely shouldn't require one to crash VS and re-open it due to it being perpetually non-responsive from that moment on. In the alternative, just show a red squiggly in the XML document as though I had a syntax error. Either way, it shouldn't break VS.\r\n\r\nFurther, I think it should allow such an entry. In keeping with the precedence rules indicated, it would simply find a pattern match for the package as before and the key should serve as a reference back to the specific package source, not as a unique identifier for that element.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nToday, it's legal to simply have:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n  <package pattern=\"*\" />\r\n  <package pattern=\"Microsoft.*\"/>\r\n</packageSource>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm simply proposing that this should be legal as well to represent the same thing.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n  <package pattern=\"*\" />\r\n</packageSource>\r\n<packageSource key=\"nuget\">\r\n  <package pattern=\"Microsoft.*\"/>\r\n</packageSource>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for the consideration!"},{"Id":"32430035766","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-10-09T20:50:55","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12914","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"\"dotnet list package --include-transitive\" should ignore docker project files\" (#12914) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nI'm trying to follow the steps outlined in the [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/introducing-package-source-mapping/) for package source mapping and it suggests that I run `dotnet list package --include-transitive` to \"view all top-level and transitive packages in your solution.\r\n\r\nMine is a solution in which every project will be built as a separate Docker container.

We have recently introduced the intel.mkl nuget packages into our project and we are being flooded with NU1603 warnings.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the package is dependend on other packages\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <dependencies>\r\n      <dependency id=\"intelopenmp.redist.win\" version=\"[2023.0.0, 2024.0.0)\" />\r\n      <dependency id=\"inteltbb.redist.win\" version=\"[2021.0.0, 2022.0.0)\" />\r\n    </dependencies>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut intel made the dependency floating to the latest possible version inside the range. I think this is a valid point but from the discussion  #5764 it seemed that the package distributor should enter only dedicated version. If this is the case, why does this possibility exist at all to allow a range of versions while the behavior (at least what was discussed from some people in #5764) should be only one dedicated version.\r\n\r\nI think this behavior was intended by intel, but it is presented as a warning which is isn't. It is only an information. \r\n\r\nBecause it is intended by intel but obviously not as desired by nuget my effort would be now to explicitly exclude the warning NU1603 everywhere in our codebase for only this package.\r\n\r\nI think I will have a hard time to convince intel to change it ;-)\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nEither disallow to set a range or allow to suppress the warning if the behavior is intended.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"32429635566","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-10-09T20:29:55","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12925","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow the loading of packages from a repository which contains a corrupted package\" (#12925) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\r\n\r\nNuGet.exe, NuGet SDK\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nIn case a local NuGet repository folder contains a corrupted NuGet package, NuGet.Protocol throws an unhandled exception showing the error message and naming the faulty package. This makes the repository unusable, nothing will load from it until all of the corrupted packages are cleared.\r\nSee the error log. To reproduce, just delete some bytes in an existing nupkg file, or delete the last few hundred bytes of it. The real life case is an interrupted download or network copy.\r\n[nuget_exception.txt](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/12832301/nuget_exception.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Desired Behavior\r\n\r\nFor my use case, it would be better if the faulty packages would be omitted from the resulting list and only added to the log. The repository would remain usable and the user could remove faulty packages all at once, instead of getting the error package by package.\r\nWithout adding the logging, the fix is very simple:\r\n_NuGet.Core\\NuGet.Protocol\\Utility\\LocalFolderUtility.cs_\r\n**GetPackagesFromNupkgs** function\r\n`return files.Select(file => GetPackageFromNupkg(file)).Where(packageInfo => packageInfo != null);`\r\nThe Where statement is new.\r\n\r\n**GetPackageFromNupkg** function\r\nAdd a new catch statement:\r\n`catch (InvalidDataException) {return null; }`\r\n\r\nThis way the content of the local repository is properly enumerated, the corrupted package is ignored.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nAdding the logging would make the current functions a little bit messy. Is it acceptable to expand the chain of calls with a logger parameter? Is it worth making a PR, or would this behavior change be refused immediately by the NuGet team?\r\nI need this change in a proprietary desktop application which uses the NuGet Client SDK as a C# library. I cannot workaround this behavior by externally wrapping and processing the NuGet output. Having a forked NuGet is not allowed, it has to be in one of the future official releases.\r\n\r\n### Error log of current behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\User\\.nuget\\packages\\nuget.commandline\\6.7.0\\tools>nuget search -Source c:\\invalidTest -PreRelease -Verbosity detailed\r\nNuGet Version: 6.7.0.127\r\n'c:\\invalidTest\\ArchitectDemo.1.0.0-pre20230914122119.nupkg' is not a valid nupkg file.

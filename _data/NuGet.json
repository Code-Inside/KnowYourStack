I mean REALLY BAD. Here is an example (for an asp.net webservice):\n\nNU1101\tUnable to find package Gladstone.ClubCentric.HeadOffice.BackEnd.DataAccess.SDABankOfIrelandEFTCommon. No packages exist with this id in source(s): ClubCentric, Microsoft, Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages\tSDAMemberWS\tC:\\Git\\Build\\ClubCentric\\HeadOffice\\BackEnd\\WebServices\\SDAMemberWS\\SDAMemberWS.csproj\t1\t\n\nThis package DOES exist. It is correctly references in the project and the nuspec file. I have cleared the nuget cache, wiped obj folders etc. The problem will be down to some OTHER package referencing this package which has some other problem, which is nigh on impossible to find. Why can this error not show the ACTUAL PACKAGE that is causing the problem...\n\nI am in the process of converting a massive (500+ project) set of solutions to using NuGet packages (as fun as it sounds) and had to do most of this manually as Visual Studio has no built-in way to do it. Namely:\n\n1) Creating a NuGet package for a DLL will not include any dependent DLLs in the same solution (i.e. non-nuget references). They have to be manually added in the &lt;files&gt; section in the .nuspec file.\n\n2) Updating an existing package (without changing the version number) requires deleting the bin and obj folders + wiping the .suo file from the hidden .vs folder in the solution, clear the nuget cache then package restore as it tends to hang around in various package.json files and obj folders otherwise causing much frustration.\n\n3) projects have to be set to output to bin\\ in all configurations rather then bin\\debug / bin\\release as you have to hard-code dependent files in the nuspec file as per point 1).\n\n4) Including project-dependent DLLs as per step 1) seems to cause the compiler to build each of their dependencies multiple times leading the much longer compile time when using nuget pack -Build. This doesn't happen with a regular build using msbuild.\n\n---\n#### Document details\n\n⚠ *Do not edit this section.

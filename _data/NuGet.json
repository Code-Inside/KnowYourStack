It works great for `PackageReference`. Now I needed to use some content file in my project and I could not achieve the desired behavior with `PrivateAssets=\"all\"`. I want to build \"base\" package with one file `data.json` which should be consumed in \"top\" package but should not be exposed further to consumers of the \"top\" package.\r\n\r\nMy \"base\" package:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <IncludeBuildOutput>false</IncludeBuildOutput>\r\n    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <Content Include=\"data.json\">\r\n      <PackagePath>contentFiles/any/any/data.json</PackagePath>\r\n    </Content>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nThe result seems to be good for me:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21261007/69996708-a573d980-1563-11ea-8069-bb275803e1fb.png)\r\n\r\nMy \"top\" package:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"BasePackage\" Version=\"1.0.0\">\r\n      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>\r\n    </PackageReference>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Result is unexpected for me:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21261007/69997235-bc66fb80-1564-11ea-8c80-23e46bfa7cdb.png)\r\n\r\nWhy is the file again in the content section? This file is a development dependency, some sort of settings file. The \"base\" package is a package with Roslyn analyzers and the settings file - `data.json`. I do not present the analyzers used for clarity. For them, `PrivateAssets` works as it should - they do not fall into the dependencies of the \"base\" package. But for the settings file - `data.json`, I can’t get the same behavior.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time resolving this issue and it seems to me that I do not see any obvious solution, which is somewhere nearby. I will be very grateful for the advice.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"10992708404","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-02T19:37:57","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7542","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generate NuGet package on build does not use the correct package version\" (#7542) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): VS UI\r\n\r\nNuGet version (4.9.0):\r\ndotnet.exe --version: 2.1.4\r\nVS version: 2017.9.2\r\n\r\nWorked before?

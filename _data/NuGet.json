If so, with which NuGet version: \r\nNot to my knowledge, I'm cleaning up old workarounds and ran into this.\r\n\r\n## Repro steps and/or sample project\r\n\r\n1. Have a project which references both the Nuget.VisualStudio and Nuget.SolutionRestoreManager.Interop nuget packages (e.g. I'm building a VS extension that relies on NuGet).\r\n2. Build the project\r\n\r\n**Expected:**\r\nNuget.VisualStudio should be referenced with EmbedInteropTypes set to true, because of https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/f24bad0668193ce21a1db8cabd1ce95ba509c7f0/src/NuGet.Clients/NuGet.VisualStudio/NuGet.VisualStudio.targets#L9\r\n\r\n**Actual:**\r\nIt's not set to embed interop types, because https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/f24bad0668193ce21a1db8cabd1ce95ba509c7f0/src/NuGet.Clients/NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.Interop/NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.Interop.targets#L6 uses the same target name, so when building we can see in the build log:\r\n>Overriding target \"LinkEmbeddableAssemblies\" in project \"C:\\Users\\jamlew\\.nuget\\packages\\nuget.visualstudio\\6.0.0-preview.0.2\\build\\NuGet.VisualStudio.targets\" with target \"LinkEmbeddableAssemblies\" from project \"C:\\Users\\jamlew\\.nuget\\packages\\nuget.solutionrestoremanager.interop\\5.8.0\\build\\NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.Interop.targets\".\r\n\r\n### Digression:\r\nThis can have downstream ramification if another project references this.  In the case I'm hitting, the referencing project (I'll call it ProjectB) references the original (ProjectA) and Nuget.VisualStudio only (though Nuget.SRM.Interop is passed transitively, it's build targets are not by default).  This causes ProjectA's generated ProjectA.csproj.nuget.g.targets to contain:\r\n``` \r\n<Import Project=\"$(NuGetPackageRoot)nuget.visualstudio\\6.0.0-preview.0.2\\build\\NuGet.VisualStudio.targets\" Condition=\"Exists('$(NuGetPackageRoot)nuget.visualstudio\\6.0.0-preview.0.2\\build\\NuGet.VisualStudio.targets')\" />\r\n<Import Project=\"$(NuGetPackageRoot)nuget.solutionrestoremanager.interop\\5.8.0\\build\\NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.Interop.targets\" Condition=\"Exists('$(NuGetPackageRoot)nuget.solutionrestoremanager.interop\\5.8.0\\build\\NuGet.SolutionRestoreManager.Interop.targets')\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut ProjectB.csproj.nuget.g.targets only contains:\r\n```\r\n<Import Project=\"$(NuGetPackageRoot)nuget.visualstudio\\6.0.0-preview.0.2\\build\\NuGet.VisualStudio.targets\" Condition=\"Exists('$(NuGetPackageRoot)nuget.visualstudio\\6.0.0-preview.0.2\\build\\NuGet.VisualStudio.targets')\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause ProjectA does not to embed types from Nuget.VisualStudio, but ProjectB does, ProjectB can encounter a compilation error: \r\n>CSC : error CS1762: A reference was created to embedded interop assembly 'nuget.visualstudio, Version=6.0.0.2, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' because of an indirect reference to that assembly created by assembly 'ProjectA, Version=17.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. Consider changing the 'Embed Interop Types' property on either assembly.\r\n\r\nThis was historically addressed by the Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK.EmbedInteropTypes package, but that package is no longer recommended for Dev17, which has exposed this issue.\r\n\r\nI have two workarounds:\r\n- Keep maintaining my own workaround target to always embed Nuget.VisualStudio (this works, but kind of sucks for me if Nuget.VS ever decides to stop embedding types in the future, as the rest of the Dev17 VS interop assemblies have already done)\r\n- I can use `<IncludeAssets>all</IncludeAssets>` as described in https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3342#issuecomment-459334177 to make all the build targets transitive, but this will still currently up with Nuget.VS not embedding types (because both projects would override the target) even though it's currently expected to be embedded.\r\n\r\n### Back on topic:\r\nIt seems like the simplest fix is to give these targets unique names (\"LinkNugetVisualStudioEmbeddableAssemblies\" and \"LinkNugetSolutionRestoreManagerInteropEmbeddableAssemblies\" maybe?) so they don't have the target name collision anymore."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"15928910571","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-13T21:31:59","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/58","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet repository signature certificate will expire on April 14th, 2021\" (#58) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"## Context\r\n\r\nAt 5:00AM PST on April 14th, 2021, the [NuGet repository signing certificate will expire](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/the-nuget-org-repository-signing-certificate-will-be-updated-as-soon-as-march-15th-2021/).

Additionally, author-signed packages provide an extra authentication mechanism to the nuget.org publishing pipeline because the signing certificate must be registered ahead of time. \r\n- **Repository signature.** Repository signatures provide an integrity guarantee for all packages in a repository whether they are author signed or not, even if those packages are obtained from a different location than the original repository where they were signed.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nYour Linux environment may give you error messages when running `dotnet restore` such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror NU3028: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The author primary signature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: self signed certificate in certificate chain\r\n\r\nerror NU3037: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The author primary signature validity period has expired.\r\n\r\nerror NU3028: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository countersignature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: self signed certificate in certificate chain\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis indicates that your environment is affected by an upstream change to [nss](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/) or `ca-certificates` packages and you'll need to update your .NET SDK to resolve it.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds have been provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you update to these builds as soon as you can to mitigate disruption on Linux environments.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nFor more details on this incident, see the following resources:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56\r\n- https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/net-5-nuget-restore-failures-on-linux-distributions-using-nss-or-ca-certificates/\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180\r\n\r\nIf you run into this issue after April 14th, 2021, please provide a comment on https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712"},{"Id":"15789095683","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T22:00:20","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/57","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet.org temporarily down due to Azure services outage\" (#57) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"NuGet.org is being affected by an outage due to issues affecting the Azure Portal and Azure services, but the team is on it.

To work around this, you can temporarily target against .NET Core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Modify CA Certificate Store\r\n\r\nDepending on your Linux distro, you can modify your CA certificate store by taking on an earlier version of your `ca-certificates` package.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the affected version is [nss 3.63+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.63_release_notes). `nss` includes a hard-coded list of trusted CA certificates and therefore can be modified to include and trust the `Verisign Universal Root Certificate Authority` again.\r\n\r\nMany Linux distros can leverage `dpkg-reconfigure` to check for the entry and enable trust for it. As a manual workaround, you may need to remove a `leading !` from the certificate line & update your CA certificates package.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Doing this is considered a bad security practice & should only be done if you understand the security implications of doing so.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nDue to existing issues with the .NET 5 signing verification feature & fallback of timestamp verification, we have decided to revoke this feature for Unix-based systems within .NET 5 SDK. Therefore your experience of using `dotnet restore` will remain largely the same as it was in .NET Core 3.1. Stay tuned for an updated .NET SDK version that will include this change.\r\n\r\n### Stay updated\r\n\r\n- We are continuing to investigate this issue and will let you know more as we find out.\r\n- We will also continue posting updates on [NuGet Status](https://status.nuget.org/) and [@NuGet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuget)."},{"Id":"15596835672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T16:16:18","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/55","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package Namespaces Proposal\" (#55) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Introduction of a feature concept called Package Namespaces which allows a developer to include or exclude package IDs by specifying package namespaces on their package source(s).\r\n\r\n🎉📦Please provide your comments, concerns, and feedback within this PR. 📦🎉\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/10660"},{"Id":"15469893086","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:14:19","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/54","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Custom V2 OData queries will be deprecated March 9th, 2021 \" (#54) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (#37) last year and conducted a dry run of the deprecation to ensure that there are no surprises for users (#40). \r\n\r\nWe will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in March 9, 2021, as detailed in [the blogpost here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/custom-v2-odata-queries-will-be-deprecated-march-9-2021/).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know about your questions or concerns on [this discussion post.](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7423)"},{"Id":"15322501248","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-25T20:01:29","Actor":"chgill-MSFT","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/53","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021\" (#53) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021.

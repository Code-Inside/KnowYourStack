Find a scenario that requires using the plugins-cache directory\r\n   1. My scenario (issue is not specific to this scenario)\r\n      1. Select an Azure DevOps feed for testing\r\n      2. Install https://github.com/Microsoft/artifacts-credprovider\r\n2.  Run lots of concurrent nuget processes that use that dir\r\n   1. E.g. `nuget <install|restore> <various packages found on the devops feed>`\r\n\r\nSome number of these will fail with errors like the following:\r\n`\r\nThe process cannot access the file 'C:\\Users\\foo\\AppData\\Local\\NuGet\\plugins-cache\\9501a58c1599e50ae562d549080e69874f89a068$CredentialProvider.Microsoft.exe\\Source-Agnostic.dat-new' because it is being used by another process.\r\nErrors in packages.config projects\r\n    The process cannot access the file 'C:\\Users\\foo\\AppData\\Local\\NuGet\\plugins-cache\\9501a58c1599e50ae562d549080e69874f89a068$CredentialProvider.Microsoft.exe\\Source-Agnostic.dat-new' because it is being used by another process.\r\n`\r\n\r\n## Suspected code\r\nI believe the issue is that `PluginCacheEntry.UpdateCacheFileAsync` is not concurrency safe.

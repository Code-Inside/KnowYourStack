At compile time for the templates project, I'd like to be able to perform some transforms on the templated csproj files so that I can automatically insert the centrally-managed package versions into the templated project files.\r\n\r\nFor example, say I'm using a centrally-managed version of 1.2.0 for OpenTelemetry. At compile time in the templates project, I might want to replace `<PackageReference Include=\"OpenTelemetry\">` with `<PackageReference Include=\"OpenTelemetry\" Version=\"1.2.0\">` in each of the templated csproj files that will be in the templates package. If I had an auto-generated version property available (e.g. `PkgVersion_OpenTelemetry`) then this would greatly simplify things. This could be an opt-in behaviour specified on the `<PackageVersion/>` element e.g. `<PackageVersion Include=\"OpenTelemetry\" Version=\"1.2.0\" GenerateVersionProperty=\"true\" />`.\r\n\r\nI can make a workable solution right now by using a .props file to defined properties for the versions of packages used in the templated csproj and import that into both the template project and Directory.Packages.props, but in an ideal world I wouldn't have to define versions for some packages in a file other than Directory.Packages.props."},{"Id":"22086034791","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-31T22:57:32","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11846","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: dotnet nuget push not detecting apikey for 3rd party symbol server\" (#11846) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nn/a\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

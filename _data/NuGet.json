A fix would be nice\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n1. Table in README markdown looks ugly if some column contains a long text due to word wrap that breaks words in other columns even inside the inline code block. Compare rendered tables: Nuget https://www.nuget.org/packages/GlobRegex vs Github https://github.com/dscheg/GlobRegex\r\nGithub markdown looks good even on narrow screens. CSS to fix issue:\r\n```css\r\n.readme-common .table {\r\n  overflow: auto;\r\n  display: block;\r\n  word-break: normal;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. It might be better to have a horizontal scroll and turn off word wrap inside multiline code blocks, because it seems such code is hard to read, given that there are no line numbers and display of hyphens: it is not always clear whether the EOL is in the code itself or word wraping has been applied. The same example links above. CSS to fix issue: `pre code { white-space: pre; }` instead of `pre code { white-space: pre-wrap; }`\r\n\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nCreate readme for the package with:\r\n1. Table with 3 columns with a long text inside the middle column\r\n2. Multiple long lines inside multiline code block\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. Table looks good even with long text in some column\r\n2. Multiline code blocks are easy to read even with long lines\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/1962268/513789fc-7d62-452b-9a10-e2e6607af536)\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"30045861526","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T19:01:45","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9530","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"FI main to dev\" (#9530) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Bringing back binding redirect fix."},{"Id":"30021470111","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T00:04:35","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9530","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"FI main to dev\" (#9530) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Bringing back binding redirect fix."},{"Id":"30021454118","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T00:03:33","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9529","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Binding redirect fix\" (#9529) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Follow up for https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9526.

This is optional but will help teams catch metadata problems before shipping.\r\n\r\nWe can formalize the tool later, perhaps with `nuget.exe verify` and some kind of rules abstraction. But this is the cheap first step.\r\n\r\nIt's a old style tools package and requires .NET Framework 4.6.2. The .exe is here inside the package:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntools\\NuGet.VerifyMicrosoftPackage.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, it can be used like `NuGet.CommandLine` or `xunit.runner.console` where the user just hard codes the path inside the package of where the .exe is.\r\n\r\nTeams with non-standard rules can specify a path to their custom rule set using `--rule-set`. We can communicate in a doc what owners have non-standard rule sets and what they are. There are 4 non-standard 4 rule sets in the PROD DB today.\r\n\r\nWe should also document that this does not cover author signature verification. This can easily be done with `nuget.exe verify -Signatures -CertificateFingerprint`.\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\n- How to know if the rules compiled into the tool are out of date?\r\n   - We would release a new package to nuget.org after every master merge. Customers would just take latest package version\r\n- Wouldn't a verify endpoint be easier? 🐱 \r\n\r\n## Example output - invalid\r\n\r\nExit code is 1 (the number of bad packages).\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing the following package path argument:\r\nC:\\Users\\jver\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\NuGetTestFolder\\5fda8093-4158-463b-b41e-de3e3b1fa2a1\\inner\\testA.nupkg\r\n\r\nINVALID.\r\nC:\\Users\\jver\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\NuGetTestFolder\\5fda8093-4158-463b-b41e-de3e3b1fa2a1\\inner\\testA.nupkg\r\nThe package TestPackage-65ed825e-dd81-4964-9599-f6a28d67171d 1.0.0 is not compliant.\r\nThere is 1 problem.\r\n  - The package metadata defines 'Not Microsoft' as one of the authors which is not allowed by policy.\r\n\r\nValid package count: 0\r\nInvalid package count: 1\r\n\r\nThe metadata validation used the following property names and JSON ruleset.\r\n\r\nReadable .NET Name      | JSON Name\r\n----------------------- | ----------\r\nAllowedAuthors          | authors\r\nAllowedCopyrightNotices | copy\r\nErrorMessageFormat      | error\r\nIsLicenseUrlRequired    | licUrlReq\r\nIsProjectUrlRequired    | projUrlReq\r\nRequiredCoOwnerUsername | u\r\n\r\nIf question marks ('?') or weird characters appear below, consider using --write-default-rule-set.\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"u\": \"Microsoft\",\r\n  \"copy\": [\r\n    \"(c) Microsoft Corporation.

I'm not sure if this combination is used on other pages as well. I would guess that the best fix would be to change the background color of the \"bg-info\" class. \r\n\r\nI could try to find a color combination, but I guess there is not \"right\" or \"wrong\", but if you would like that I should try something just give me a comment here. :)"},{"Id":"11524077052","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-14T23:11:34","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7657","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Epic] Improve search results for Visual Studio (VS) client\" (#7657) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"11584439179","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-22T17:20:58","Actor":"liesauer","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9209","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"nuget push does not accept absolute path of a package\" (#9209) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: NuGet.exe\r\n\r\nNuGet version: 2.8.7.0\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1. upload a package with full path.\r\n\r\n2. nuget can not find the package because it always combine with current directory no matter it is an absolute path or a relative path.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd /home/AnotherWorkSpace\r\nnuget push /path/to/project/package.1.0.0.nupkg -Source \"NuGet\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand say\r\n```\r\nDirectory '/home/AnotherWorkSpace/path/to/project/package.1.0.0.nupkg' not found.\r\n```\r\ncombine with current directory when specifing a absolute path is not right!\r\n"},{"Id":"11584378611","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-22T17:00:33","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/9208","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Show client cert spec is approved, pending implementation\" (#9208) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11584362214","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-22T16:55:04","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/8823","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"ClientsCertificate feature spec\" (#8823) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Added draft specification accordingly to [request](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3098#pullrequestreview-311461805)"},{"Id":"11583509838","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-22T11:32:09","Actor":"jozefizso","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9207","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"IncludeSource in .csproj doesn't work\" (#9207) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I addthe **IncludeSource** configuration to the **.csproj** file and I also tried to set it on msbuild command line.

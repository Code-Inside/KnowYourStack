Really anything recent\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1.  Create a new project (of any real kind that has a nuget package reference). A dotnet core console app works fine. The project should have not * versioning. For example, the following package ref works:\r\n```\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n2. Add a feed to the Nuget.config which can't be accessed.  A 404 or a 401 works fine here. For example, the following NuGet.config:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n  <solution>\r\n    <add key=\"disableSourceControlIntegration\" value=\"true\" />\r\n  </solution>\r\n  <packageSources>\r\n    <clear />\r\n    <add key=\"nuget.org\" value=\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\" />\r\n    <add key=\"inaccessible\" value=\"https://api.nuget.org/v10/index.json\" />\r\n  </packageSources>\r\n  <disabledPackageSources>\r\n    <clear />\r\n  </disabledPackageSources>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n3. Restore. The restore will fail because the inaccessible feed cannot be accessed\r\n\r\n## Why this shouldn't fail\r\n\r\nWe do not need to fail. Because there is no * versioning in any part of the dependency graph, the restore will either find the required packages, or it will not and it and restore will fail. **Because there is no * versioning, an exhaustive search of all input feeds is not required.**\r\n\r\nThe reason why the dotnet team wants this behavior over the current behavior is that we are an open source project that primarily works in the open, but occasionally needs to do internal builds for security fixes. When doing these security fixes, internal feeds will appear in our On release day, we:\r\n1. Publish our built packages to nuget.org\r\n2. Push the internal commits used to build the release to the public repos and tag them. Customers use these commits to build their own versions of the repos.\r\n3. These commits have internal feeds in their nuget.config files, but because external customers do not have access to these feeds, they cannot build the commit without altering the nuget.config file, even though all required dependencies are accessible.\r\n\r\nWe've worked around this in .NET Core by creating scripting which dynamically alters the nuget.config file prior to build, but this is clunky, only applies to automated builds, and non-obvious.\r\n\r\nThere are some other reasons not to fail:\r\n- If we fail, it means altering or refactoring feed structures can mean that old commits become unbuildable. For instance, the .NET Core team will remove feeds containing isolated, stable packages that are created while doing final builds as those packages are moved to nuget.org. Those feeds still exist in nuget.config from old commits, but those commits will no longer build even though the packages that they need are fully accessible."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"12779263648","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-30T21:31:53","Actor":"t-mog-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/46","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Advanced Search on NuGet.org\" (#46) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec for 'Advanced Search on NuGet.org' is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n| Spec wiki | Discussion issue |\r\n| :----------:| :----------------: |\r\n| [Advanced Search on NuGet.org](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Advanced-Search-on-NuGet.org) | [NuGet/NuGetGallery#2636](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/2636) |"},{"Id":"12582399620","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-09T17:20:40","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/45","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"CVE-2020-1340 - NuGet Gallery Spoofing Vulnerability\" (#45) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"A spoofing vulnerability exists when the NuGet Gallery does not properly sanitize input on package metadata values.

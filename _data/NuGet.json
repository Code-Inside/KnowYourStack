Therefore, management has decided that business continuity is more important than warning customers that their project is using packages with known vulnerabilities, and we're reverting this change.\r\n\r\nMost of the concern is around \"false positives\" (System.* packages whose contents are not actually used because the framework's targeting pack provides assemblies with a higher version).

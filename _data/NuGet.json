All of the projects in this solution use [CPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/central-package-management) to manage dependency versions. Since the `dotnet` commands and templates do not use that feature by default, I chose (perhaps poorly) to edit the `Directory.Packages.props` manually through VS Code whenever dependency versions need to change.\r\n\r\n#### This particular issue\r\n\r\nI wrote invalid XML in my `Directory.Packages.props` - specifically, an unclosed tag. This caused subsequent calls to `dotnet restore` to fail. One error message appears for each dependency, in a form like so:\r\n\r\n> MyProject.csproj : warning NU1604: Project dependency Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer does not contain an inclusive lower bound. Include a lower bound in the dependency version to ensure consistent restore results.\r\n\r\nIf `dotnet restore` is called with _detailed_- or _diagnostic_-level verbosity, I note the following in the output:\r\n\r\n> Project \"/path/to/solution/Directory.Packages.props\" was not imported by \"/path/to/dotnet/sdk/6.0.400/NuGet.props\" at (35,3), due to the file being invalid.\r\n\r\n#### My request\r\n\r\nLooking at the official docs for NU1604, I noticed no reference to CPM. Please provide some kind of link, and (if it's not too much trouble) suggest that there might be this kind of situation with a malformed file.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Document Details\r\n\r\n⚠ *Do not edit this section.

See the functional tests containing `hijack=true` for context. There is also one such case in the end-to-end tests. In short, there are many integration tests today that depend on checking for a package's availability prior to V3 indexing.\r\n\r\nEssentially the difference when the new parameter is specified as `hijack=false`, you can see a package even before it has made its way the search service but _after_ validation is complete. This was previously achieved in various monitoring and testing places in our code via opaque hacks like adding an `$orderby` that can't be hijacked or adding `1 eq 1` to a `$filter`. \r\n\r\nGiven the excellent performance of an ID+version lookup, it is acceptable to allow this non-hijacked query from a performance perspective. By the way, the package details page does this SQL query and much more.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach could have been to carefully scrutinize each place that uses `hijack=false` and convince ourselves that moving from a non-hijacked to a hijacked query is acceptable from both a test coverage and flakiness perspective. My feeling is that this is not worth the risk. Also, in general we would be giving up from a testing/monitoring perspective on observing the state before a package is fully indexed in search but after it is validated.\r\n\r\nI think that this PR (simple test hook) is better than the alternative. I think it is reasonable to have a programmatic way of fetching the DB state of a package and this is the simplest approach given our current various codebases. This will be undocumented on our public API surface area and not intended for external consumption, much like the internal `/search/query` endpoint on the search service.\r\n\r\nProgress on https://github.com/NuGet/Engineering/issues/2902."},{"Id":"13225905259","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-17T22:17:54","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8145","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[2020-08-07] Deployment\" (#8145) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"# Gallery\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Add functional tests on Gallery for Advanced Search (#8115) \r\n* Use protected configuration provider instead of reflection (WITHOUT DI) (#8132)\r\n* Add command to compare PackageVulnerabilities to GitHub API (#7706) \r\n* Unbreak GitHubVulnerabilities2Db dependency injection (#8139) \r\n* Fix for: Malicious OData requests trigger exception monitoring (#8141) \r\n* Update range's vulnerability before entity update to fix index uniqueness error (#8140)\r\n\r\nProgress:\r\n* [x] Merge RI: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8147\r\n* [x] Build: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=3958957&view=results\r\n* [x] Release: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_releaseProgress?_a=release-pipeline-progress&releaseId=772272\r\n* [ ] DEV\r\n* [x] INT\r\n* [x] PROD\r\n\r\n# GitHubVulnerabilities2Db\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Unbreak GitHubVulnerabilities2Db dependency injection (https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8139)\r\n* Fix PackageVulnerability indexing uniqueness error (https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8140)\r\n\r\nProgress:\r\n* [x] Merge RI: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8147\r\n* [x] Build: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=3958944&view=results\r\n* [x] Release: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_releaseProgress?_a=release-pipeline-progress&releaseId=772284\r\n* [x] DEV\r\n* [x] INT\r\n* [x] PROD"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"13227555661","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-18T03:32:30","Actor":"jazzdelightsme","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9921","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Pack tells me it will exclude folder starting with dot, but does not\" (#9921) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Version info\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): **NuGet.exe**\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): **5.6.0.6591**\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): **Win10 Version 2004 (OS Build20195.1000)**\r\n\r\nWorked before?

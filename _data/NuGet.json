When we build our VS extension against a particular version of NuGet.ProjectModel, for instance, and then the end user updates VS to a version with a different in-box version of NuGet.ProjectModel, our extension breaks.  Obviously redist'ing these assemblies would break VS and I'm sure is not an intended scenario.  It would seem our only viable option is to clone the entire repo, build locally, and redist under a different set of assembly names.

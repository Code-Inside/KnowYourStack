They can add myget URLs, internal feeds, etc, all in Visual Studio, and those feeds will be available to `dotnet`. On Mac, users follow that same expectation and then cannot figure out why `dotnet` is not using the feeds they just configured.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope it's possible to fix this in time for .NET Core 2.0 final.\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\n\r\n`NuGetFolderPath.UserSettingsDirectory` is [documented](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior) to resolve to `%APPDATA%\\NuGet`. On Mac and Linux, using Mono, `SpecialFolder.ApplicationData` has always followed the [freedesktop.org XDG Base Directory Spec](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), and mapped to the value of `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (or `~/.config` by default).\r\n\r\nSo, anyone using `NuGet.Client` on Mac or Linux would have `NuGetFolderPath.UserSettingsDirectory` map to `~/.config/NuGet` by default. This is depended on by Visual Studio for Mac, among other products.\r\n\r\nIn fact, `Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData` returns `~/.config` in .NET Core 2.0, just like Mono.\r\n\r\nHowever, in `NuGetEnvironment`, which had to support earlier versions of .NET Core that lacked the `Environment.SpecialFolder` APIs, there is a [custom implementation](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/4.3.0.4273/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Common/PathUtil/NuGetEnvironment.cs#L81) to resolve locations like `ApplicationData`.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, [`ApplicationData` is made to resolve to `~/.nuget`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/4.3.0.4273/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Common/PathUtil/NuGetEnvironment.cs#L129), even though `LocalApplicationData` is correctly following the XDG spec.\r\n\r\nI have to assume this behavior was kept to avoid breaking compatibility with earlier .NET Core releases. But I think that break is necessary to provide consistency with Visual Studio for Mac and other tools.\r\n\r\nOther reasons to fix this:\r\n\r\n* Consistency with [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior).\r\n* Consistency with Windows, which has dropped use of  `~/.nuget`.\r\n* Littering a Linux user's home directory with random dot directories is bad practice. Users should be able to switch their entire desktop's configuration by simply changing the value of `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.\r\n\r\nThis bug was originally filed at https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/1398, but I was asked to move the discussion here."},{"Id":"23449562884","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-08-16T00:13:32","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4413","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[MacOS, Linux] NuGet writes the NuGet.Config in ~/.config folder, but dotnet restore reads from ~/.nuget\" (#4413) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"When using NuGet to add a private feed, `NuGet Sources Add` writes in `~/.config/NuGet/NuGet.Config` file.

package contains one or more pdbs that are not portable.\r\n\r\nHowever upon closer investigation, the failure is not because the PDBs are portable but because the PEReader saw that the PDB and DLL do not match.\r\n\r\nI think the error is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Jobs/blob/dbd927c309005b63b82c1017ff6bfcfec96434cf/src/Validation.Symbols/SymbolsValidatorService.cs#L251\r\n\r\nThis should use the error message `ValidationIssue.SymbolErrorCode_MatchingAssemblyNotFound`.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nUpload a snupkg with a portable PDB that matches in name but does not match according to `PEReader.TryOpenAssociatedPortablePdb`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe validation should fail with a more helpful error message.\r\n\r\n###

To do this, upper version limits in nuget packages help a lot.  You cannot currently do this with ProjectReferences and `dotnet pack`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n* Create two projects, MyReferencedPackage, and MyNewPackage.\r\n* Add version information for both packages (e.g. version `1.2.3`)\r\n* Reference MyReferencedPackage from MyNewPackage using a ProjectReference attribute.\r\n  * `<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\MyReferencedPackage\\MyReferencedPackage.csproj\" />`\r\n* _(modify the reference above somehow yet to be defined)_\r\n* run dotnet pack on both projects.\r\n\r\n## Expected  behavior\r\nproject version in nupkg has a version range (e.g. `MyReferencedPackage (≥1.2.3 && < 2.0.0)`)\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nproject version in nupkg has the built packages version (e.g. `MyReferencedPackage (≥1.2.3)`)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not too worried on the implementation detail of what the xml should look like, but as a for instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\MyReferencedPackage\\MyReferencedPackage.csproj\" >\r\n    <MaximumVersion Inclusive=\"false\">2</MaximumVersion>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo produce the reference from the example above of `MyReferencedPackage (≥1.2.3 && < 2.0.0)`\r\n (Or if Inclusive is true, then `MyReferencedPackage (≥1.2.3 && ≤ 2.0.0)`)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/cli#7113_"},{"Id":"11503762588","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-12T21:45:35","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9173","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Lock file and cpvm scenarios might not be replaying the warnings correctly/include them in the assets file. \" (#9173) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"See comment: "},{"Id":"11503524647","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-12T21:16:46","Actor":"zkat","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9171","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"HTTPS://ANCENTNIE.SLACK.COM\" (#9171) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Please read the following information before posting the issue.\r\n\r\n## Before posting the issue...\r\n\r\n* If you're having trouble with the NuGet.org Website, please post in [NuGetGallery issues](http://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery/issues)\r\n* If you're having trouble with the NuGet client tools (the Visual Studio extension, NuGet.exe command line tool, etc.), you are in the right place.\r\n\r\nRemove the content above here and fill out details below.\r\n\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe):\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx):\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe --version (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)):\r\n\r\nWorked before?

Go to the \"Manage\" page of a package\r\n2. Unfold the \"Documentation\" part\r\n3. Put raw content or a Github link, or upload from a local file\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nWe should be able to upload at the same time we publish a package. I suspect (hope?) it's possible, but searching  the following documentations yielded nothing:\r\n - https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/api/package-publish-resource\r\n - https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/api/registration-base-url-resource\r\n - https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/api/nuget-protocols\r\n\r\nI also tried by spying quickly to what is being done when manually uploading  with Devtools, but I could not yield anything really actionable API-wise.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nWe are building and publishing from CI, so manually uploading is really not an option. I have seen there is expected work to make the NuGet self-contained including the README/documentation part, but so far this work has not yet started.\r\n\r\nSo, is it possible or not to perform this documentation upload step from the API ?\r\n\r\nI'm quite a newbie in regards of the NuGet world, so it's possible I am missing something obvious here.

consistent. \r\n\r\nThe argument for ignoring missing imports is summarized in https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/pull/3278. \r\n\r\n```\r\nSome shipped SDKs have imports that are property based but are missing conditions. This makes it impossible to retrofit them with a NuGet package since NuGet restore won't succeed because an import is missing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what if the imports in question might actually be genuinely missing cause of a setup issue. They might need to bring in a PackageReference themselves. \r\n\r\nRegardless of what the decision is, all NuGet tooling should be consistent. \r\n\r\nRelated https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7576\r\n\r\nfyi @jeffkl @zivkan \r\n\r\nThoughts @NuGet/nuget-client?

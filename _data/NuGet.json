When the scope is disposed, Autofac will perform a best-effort release of all references to types from that context so the assemblies can be unloaded. <a href=\"https://autofac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/scopes-loadcontexts.html\">The documentation explains this in greater detail.</a></li>\n<li><strong>Documentation links in exception messages.</strong> Common Autofac exceptions now include links to <a href=\"https://autofac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting/index.html#exceptions\">our online documentation</a> to help you understand what the exceptions mean and how to troubleshoot them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Issues and PRs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add documentation links to common exceptions by <a href=\"https://github.com/tillig\"><code>@​tillig</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1359\">autofac/Autofac#1359</a></li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/1360\">#1360</a>: Unify the &quot;no constructors found&quot; reporting by <a href=\"https://github.com/tillig\"><code>@​tillig</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1362\">autofac/Autofac#1362</a></li>\n<li>Add support for required properties by <a href=\"https://github.com/alistairjevans\"><code>@​alistairjevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1364\">autofac/Autofac#1364</a></li>\n<li>Mark RegisterGeneratedFactory obsolete by <a href=\"https://github.com/tillig\"><code>@​tillig</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1366\">autofac/Autofac#1366</a></li>\n<li>Isolate service information computed in child scopes from the parent scope by <a href=\"https://github.com/alistairjevans\"><code>@​alistairjevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1350\">autofac/Autofac#1350</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/compare/v6.5.0...v7.0.0\">https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/compare/v6.5.0...v7.0.0</a></p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>net50</code> no longer targeted.</strong> Autofac will still work with .NET 5 via the <code>netstandard2.1</code> target, but we recommend you upgrade to a later, supported version of .NET.</li>\n<li><strong>Properties marked <code>required</code> will now be injected by default.</strong> As noted above, <code>required</code> properties will be injected. This is a behavioral change from Autofac 6.0.</li>\n<li><strong>Default property injection ignores <code>required</code> properties.</strong> Using <code>PropertiesAutowired()</code> will ignore <code>required</code> properties because it's assumed they must be set during construction rather than post-object-creation.</li>\n<li><strong><code>RegisterGeneratedFactory</code> is obsolete.</strong> This feature has been replaced by the <code>Func&lt;X, Y, B&gt;</code> built-in relationship and delegate factories.</li>\n<li><strong><code>ILifetimeScope</code> has a new <code>BeginLoadContextLifetimeScope</code> method.</strong> If you have mocks of <code>ILifetimeScope</code> this method must now be implemented.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v6.5.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reflection caches have moved to a central location <code>Autofac.Core.ReflectionCacheSet</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/1341\">#1341</a>).

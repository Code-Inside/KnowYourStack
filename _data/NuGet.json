This means that once a user has selected a tab, they must still tab navigate through the remaining inactive tabs before they can access the tab content.\r\n\r\n**Previously,**\r\n![20220325_182528](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82980589/160219270-24b3d6af-42ae-484e-a867-cbae22dbc822.gif)\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\n\r\nI added an event listener for left and right arrow keys, and changed the tab in focus based on the input. I used keyUp as the trigger here rather than keyDown, because adding an event listener for keyDown also messed with other keyboard functionality (eg. 'tab' and 'enter' keys) when focused on the tab element.\r\n\r\nTo enable this, I also made it such that only the selected/expanded tab has _tabindex=\"0\"_ and receives tab focus sequentially with other elements on the page, while all inactive tabs have _tabindex=\"-1\"_, and can only receive focus when using left/right arrow keys from their active sibling tab. Once a new tab is made active, we set _tabindex=\"-1\"_ on the previous tab, and _tabindex=\"0\"_ on the new active tab.\r\n\r\n**After the changes,**\r\n![20220325_181409](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82980589/160219028-f8bd7c95-7efc-410a-8d32-3140726d749d.gif)"},{"Id":"20982767661","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T21:52:05","Actor":"ryuyu","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9074","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[A11y]Enable dismissing Verified tooltip with esc\" (#9074) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Currently, when navigated to by keyboard, the verified tooltip cannot be dismissed without tabbing away from the icon.\r\nThis change enables dismissing this tooltip by usage of the esc key for all locations where this tooltip is used.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus it also fixes a bug that could cause the tooltip to stop working altogether when clicked on."},{"Id":"20982504674","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T21:32:10","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9078","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Reduce the amount of magic numbers in JS code in Gallery\" (#9078) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Gallery JS code is ridden with magic numbers:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L12\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L244\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L574-L578\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/autocomplete.js#L64-L67\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFor better code readability it would be nice to provide nice names at least for some of them (key codes, for example).

Please use any relevant sections and delete anything you don't need. -->\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\n<!--\r\n* Please include a clear and concise description of the problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen rebuilding our 80+ project solutions we sporadically get the following error on the `_CleanPackageFiles` target:\r\n\r\n`MSB3061 Unable to delete file \"C:\\Projects\\MyProject\\src\\MyProject\\obj\\MyPlatform\\Debug\\MyProject.MyPlatform.3.0.0-debug.nuspec\". Access to the path 'C:\\Projects\\MyProject\\src\\MyProject\\obj\\MyPlatform\\Debug\\MyProject.MyPlatform.3.0.0-debug.nuspec' is denied.`\r\n\r\nThis issue happens for seemingly random projects in our solution.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\n* Include as much of the following as possible:\r\n\r\n* A minimal sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n* Your zipped project.\r\n* IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour.\r\n* Your command line invocation\r\n\r\nIf providing steps to reproduce the issue proves difficult, consider attaching a binlog:\r\n[Details on sharing binary logs](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog)\r\n[More information on binary logs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md)\r\nNOTE: Binary logs capture environment information. Ensure it does not include any information you don't want to be public before you attach one.\r\nIf you want to share one just with Microsoft, you can [report a problem through Visual Studio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report) and share it privately with Microsoft.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExecute the following MSBuild command until the issue presents itself (Build runs with `Configuration` set to `Debug` and `Platform` set to `any cpu` by default):\r\n\r\n`msbuild MySolution.MyPlatform.sln /bl -t:Rebuild -m --restore`\r\n\r\nThe impacted projects have `IsPackable` and `GeneratePackageOnBuild` set to true and `PackageOutputPath` set to `$(RepositoryRootDirectory)nuget\\nupkg\\$(Configuration)\\`. Furthermore, the projects have `TargetFrameworks` set to `net48;netcoreapp3.1;net6.0`.\r\n\r\nThe issue can also be reproduced by opening the solution in Visual Studio and rebuilding the solution. This yields more consistent results.\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n\r\nWe have multiple solutions targeting the same projects but for a different platform so we use a `Directory.Build.props` file that modifies the following MSBuild variables to allow for everything to compile to a separate output folder (`BuildForPlatform` is set per project or in a nested Directory.Build.props file based on requirements and `MySolutionPlatform` is determined by the solution name):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!-- BEGIN Sets project output paths for platform-specific projects -->\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(BuildForPlatform)'=='true'\">\r\n    <MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath>obj\\$(MySolutionPlatform)</MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>obj\\$(MySolutionPlatform)\\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <BaseOutputPath>bin\\$(MySolutionPlatform)</BaseOutputPath>\r\n    <DefaultItemExcludes>$(DefaultItemExcludes);bin/**;obj/**</DefaultItemExcludes>\r\n    <PackageId>$(MSBuildProjectName).$(MySolutionPlatform)</PackageId>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <!-- END -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe build our solutions in parallel using the `-m` MSBuild switch or by setting `maximum number of parallel project builds` in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The expected output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs happens sometimes, the solution will be rebuilt and all NuGet packages are generated as expected.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The actual output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRebuilding one of the projects fails with the error mentioned above, causing a cascading failure for all projects depending on the project causing the issue. We've verified this behavior using both Visual Studio and the MSBuild command line. The issue happens more often when building using Visual Studio but we've also seen occurrences when using MSBuild, especially when building on our build server. \r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n<!--\r\n* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here.\r\n* Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI generated a `.binlog` file and did some analysis and the issue might be caused by the `_CleanPackageFiles` target running for each target framework during the inner build, which are built in parallel. This seems weird as the `Pack` is only executed once (after all inner builds are completed, which makes sense). I've submitted the binlog as a Visual Studio issue (see: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Binlog-for-https:githubcomdotnetmsb/1691529?entry=myfeedback)\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMSBuild version: `17.1.0.7609`\r\nOS: `Windows 10 Enterprise 21H2`\r\n"},{"Id":"21033055672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-31T03:58:50","Actor":"v-luzh","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11703","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: A prompt error “cannot access disposed object” prevents solution saving after installing a package from local path\" (#11703) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\nDev\\6.2.0.132\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\nDev\\6.2.0.131\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\n### Details about Problem\r\nVS Version: Main\\32329.175\r\nNuGet Version: Dev\\6.2.0.132\r\nOS Version: Windows-11-Enterprise-21H2\r\n\r\n### Repro steps:\r\n1.Only enable one package source which point to local path (have some packages) in the Options->NuGet Package Manager->Package Sources.\r\n2.Create a C# Console App (.NET Core 6.0) project in VS.\r\n3.Right-Click the project in the Solution Explorer window, select ‘Manage NuGet Packages…’ and select the package source (which I set in step1) in the Package source drop-down box.\r\n4.Click “Browse” tab and install a package from the local path.\r\n5.Save the solution and close VS.\r\n\r\n### Expected:\r\nThe solution can be saved and closed successfully.\r\n\r\n### Actual:\r\nA prompt error “cannot access disposed object” prevents solution saving after installing a package from local path as below.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20632625/160847414-e8cc9efa-e410-4a29-9a87-9b672aa87f38.png)\r\n### Notes:\r\n1.It reproes on .NET SDK style projects, does not repro on .NET Framework projects.\r\n2.It just repro on local path packages, dose not repro on online package source (e.g. nuget.org).\r\n3.It start to repro from Dev\\6.2.0.132, doesn't repro on Dev\\6.2.0.131.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"20398585964","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T18:32:01","Actor":"clairernovotny","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/61","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Requiring two-factor authentication on NuGet.org\" (#61) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced plans to require tFA on all accounts on NuGet.org.

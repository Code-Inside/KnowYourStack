Unfortunately, this duplicate message effect can snowball out of control very quickly, especially if it happens at the same time as a large number of package pushes.\n\n![image.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/58054e1495e42b6c5baa9ebb/554c4944-3b6a-4c2e-a3b2-2ef7cf1ea632)\n\nA couple proposed solutions:\n1) `Monitoring2Monitoring` should somehow be aware of what's in the queue and only requeue packages that aren't\n2) `Monitoring2Monitoring` should only requeue when the number of packages in the queue is low or should requeue less frequently when there are a large amount of packages in the queue.\n3) `MonitoringProcessor` should de-dupe messages to revalidate packages that have already succeeded, or require some amount of time has passed before it will revalidate a valid package.\n\nPersonally I think 2 would be the easiest implementation for the highest payoff. Requiring there to be less than 10 packages in the queue or so would make it impossible to have more than 10 plus the number of invalid packages in the queue at once."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"9781277080","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T19:17:16","Actor":"dtivel","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8210","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Plugins:  cache file is never read\" (#8210) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"[Plugin cache files](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/NuGet-cross-plat-authentication-plugin#avoid-instantiating-the-plugins-frequently) are never read by the product.

If so, with which NuGet version: 4.8.1\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\nIt seems that NuGet 4.9 does not consider the fallback folders defined by the .NET Core sdk. This results in NuGet going online and downloading .nupkgs. NuGet 4.8.1 and nuget 4.7 which ships with Mono 5.18 currently do not do this. This is also affecting Visual Studio for Mac when it is using NuGet 4.9.\r\n\r\nnuget.exe taken from nuget.org/downloads\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n\r\n~/.config/NuGet/NuGet.Config has main nuget.org source enabled but no fallback folders.\r\nOpen a terminal window.\r\nmkdir dotnet\r\ncd dotnet\r\nnuget locals all -clear\r\ndotnet new console\r\nls ~/.nuget/packages\r\n    Folder does not exist.\r\nnuget locals all -clear\r\nmono path/to/nuget.exe restore dotnet.csproj\r\n\r\nOutput from NuGet 4.9.2 and 4.9.1:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMSBuild auto-detection: using msbuild version '15.0' from '/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/5.18.0/lib/mono/msbuild/15.0/bin'.\r\nRestoring packages for /Users/matt/Projects/dotnet/dotnet.csproj...\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.app/index.json\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.app/index.json 422ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.app/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.app.2.1.0.nupkg\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.app/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.app.2.1.0.nupkg 42ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostpolicy/index.json\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.platforms/index.json\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.targets/index.json\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/netstandard.library/index.json\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostpolicy/index.json 138ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostpolicy/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostpolicy.2.1.0.nupkg\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.platforms/index.json 285ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.platforms/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.platforms.2.1.0.nupkg\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.targets/index.json 427ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.targets/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.targets.2.1.0.nupkg\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/netstandard.library/index.json 584ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/netstandard.library/2.0.3/netstandard.library.2.0.3.nupkg\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostpolicy/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostpolicy.2.1.0.nupkg 486ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostresolver/index.json\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.platforms/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.platforms.2.1.0.nupkg 448ms\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.targets/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.targets.2.1.0.nupkg 424ms\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/netstandard.library/2.0.3/netstandard.library.2.0.3.nupkg 372ms\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostresolver/index.json 9600ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostresolver/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostresolver.2.1.0.nupkg\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostresolver/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.dotnethostresolver.2.1.0.nupkg 44ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnetapphost/index.json\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnetapphost/index.json 138ms\r\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnetapphost/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.dotnetapphost.2.1.0.nupkg\r\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netcore.dotnetapphost/2.1.0/microsoft.netcore.dotnetapphost.2.1.0.nupkg 43ms\r\nInstalling Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetAppHost 2.1.0.\r\nInstalling Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetHostResolver 2.1.0.\r\nInstalling Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetHostPolicy 2.1.0.\r\nInstalling NETStandard.Library 2.0.3.\r\nInstalling Microsoft.NETCore.Targets 2.1.0.\r\nInstalling Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms 2.1.0.\r\nInstalling Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.0.\r\nCommitting restore...\r\nGenerating MSBuild file /Users/matt/Projects/dotnet/obj/dotnet.csproj.nuget.g.props.\r\nGenerating MSBuild file /Users/matt/Projects/dotnet/obj/dotnet.csproj.nuget.g.targets.\r\nWriting lock file to disk.

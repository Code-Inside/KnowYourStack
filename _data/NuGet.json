A fix would be nice\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n1. Table in README markdown looks ugly if some column contains a long text due to word wrap that breaks words in other columns even inside the inline code block. Compare rendered tables: Nuget https://www.nuget.org/packages/GlobRegex vs Github https://github.com/dscheg/GlobRegex\r\nGithub markdown looks good even on narrow screens.

It might be better to have a horizontal scroll and turn off word wrap inside multiline code blocks, because it seems such code is hard to read, given that there are no line numbers and display of hyphens: it is not always clear whether the EOL is in the code itself or word wraping has been applied. The same example links above. CSS to fix issue: `pre code { white-space: pre; }` instead of `pre code { white-space: pre-wrap; }`\r\n\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nCreate readme for the package with:\r\n1.

Instead, it renders the dependency groups. If there are no dependency groups, it doesn't show any frameworks:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/31554645-04ba4bdc-aff3-11e7-9dc2-cba00c2562e5.png)\r\n\r\nAnd if there are some, it quickly looks super busy, even in packages with few dependencies (check out [JSON.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/)). And for meta packages it's basically not working at all (check out [NETStandard.Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NETStandard.Library)).\r\n\r\nIf think we want to render the lowest version of a framework that the package is compatible with. We probably also want to hide or at least deemphasize legacy frameworks:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/31554441-6fae0cd6-aff2-11e7-939e-5206cf1699b3.png)\r\n\r\nIf my package only targets .NET Standard, I should still see the list of frameworks I’m effectively compatible with (i.e. the list above). Ideally, the list of frameworks would remain the same between packages but we’d indicate unsupported ones. For instance, let’s say the package only targets .NET Framework 2.0, this is what I would expect to see:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/31554451-7534c4ce-aff2-11e7-96c8-116496f55a84.png)\r\n\r\nLogically, I think we want to have a list of frameworks on the server for which we do hit testing with each package. Adding new frameworks should update the display for all packages.\r\n\r\n## .NET Standard\r\n\r\nWe probably want to treat .NET Standard specially, at least by displaying it first. If a package has .NET Framework assets, it might be consumable via the .NET Standard 2.0 compatibility mode. It seems we should think if and how we could render that information. Maybe like this?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/31555337-8544e7a6-aff5-11e7-8924-1217fa9a91ca.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"20270571144","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-15T15:51:05","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9004","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: \" (#9004) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use NuGet.org\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nNot able to connect to the project website https://webgrease.codeplex.com/.

While someone who's experienced with security tools like OpenSSL can likely take what they have and convert it to the requested format without too much trouble, this could be a very confusing and time-consuming process of research and trial-and-error for developers who aren't experienced with certificates. This could eventually lead to them giving up on signing packages or carrying out unsafe actions in pursuit of answers (I.e. using untrusted web-based certificate conversion tools and accidentally leaking their private key). It's in the interest of the entire NuGet ecosystem to ensure package authors can sign and validate packages as easily and painlessly as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways I think this experience could be improved:\r\n- Tell the user what they uploaded. While it may take some additional code to determine the kind and format of a certificate that the gallery can't handle, it would give the user a much better starting point for researching how to convert it to the appropriate format. There are so many different starting points, and the extensions can mean so many different things, just understanding what you have in your hand is a huge help.\r\n- Link to a general overview of how security certificates work like [this one](https://www.ssl.com/guide/pem-der-crt-and-cer-x-509-encodings-and-conversions/). \r\n- Suggest that the user import their certificate into the Windows Certificate Manager MMC snap-in and then export it from there. This could be some simple inline text, at least enough to suggest it's something worth researching, and/or a link to a full article [like this](https://support.globalsign.com/ssl/ssl-certificates-installation/import-and-export-certificate-microsoft-windows). I'd also mention that the private key _does not_ need to be exported with the certificate here.\r\n- Suggest that the user use OpenSSL either through WSL or on Linux. This doesn't need to include OpenSSL commands for all types of conversions, but even just mentioning that this is an available tool that can help convert to the correct certificate format for upload could help start the user down the right path.\r\n\r\nAnother related mitigation beyond better help text could be to accept more certificate formats, thus reducing the number of failures requiring better text up front. For example, accepting a PEM encoded certificate in addition to DER.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"20260396530","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-15T06:36:06","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9000","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: Using nuget.core 2.14.0 with https://www.nuget.org/api/v2 no longer allows finding packages.\" (#9000) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\r\n\r\nI'm unable to use NuGet.org\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe are using NuGet.Core 2.14.0 with https://www.nuget.org/api/v2 and yesterday we started experiencing an error blocking finding packages.\r\n\r\nWe are getting the following exception on almost all packages we try to find using FindPackages(...)\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Response version '3.0' is not supported.

This used to exist with the model of `install.ps1` but that is no longer available.  There are many scenarios where this is desired, but the current solutions (msbuild targets) does not complete the experience.  NuGet should make available a renewed model for post-package add configuration in some type of plugin model that enables packages to augment the experience when adding.  Right now the users who only use tools like VS Package Manager UI don't get a pleasant experience when adding packages that actually **require** post-add steps to be meaningful and the PM UI experience doesn't expose/alert them to such.  The experience does not put the developer on the path of success and in some cases it puts them into the pit of failure.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nRazor components in ASPNET are one such category here.  Nearly every Razor component will follow the pattern of asking the user to do the following:\r\n\r\n- Add the package\r\n- Modify their _Imports.razor file to include an additional import\r\n- Modify their index.html file to add links to the embedded CSS/JS files as a part of the component\r\n- Modify their Program/Startup.cs files to register new DI services that may be required for the component to work\r\n\r\nWhen a developer does the first step...especially in VS...they aren't guided to know the other steps are needed unless they are able to navigate successfully to the docs.  Otherwise they will be in an F5 loop, change something, fail, add the other thing, fail, repeat until they find success.\r\n\r\nCompared to something analogous like the Vue framework which when you add a UI component (akin to a Razor component), it adds the package and also enables a hook to modify what is needed.  In the Vue model, you are immediately put on the path of success.  Here is an example showing a new Vue app and me adding a cool UI component library...observe the end state shows that all is modified for me to be successful:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4821/154180697-78863835-7ea4-473b-8fad-991780001722.mp4\r\n\r\nObserve that the after state has all the requirements for me to be immediately successful.\r\n\r\nCompare that to Razor+NuGet:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4821/154181509-9543cc15-9283-458b-b156-f2d71e92e5e9.mp4\r\n\r\nObserve the after state has only added the package and I still need 4 more steps to be successful but there also is no information even telling me that.  I now have to modify three things and in this particular example I'll still get an error until I realize I have to add 2 more things that weren't told to me.  It's just a poorer experience.\r\n\r\nProviding a better experience for authors to enable post-install steps would enable this scenario easily and others that have already been reported."},{"Id":"20276999921","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-15T22:02:02","Actor":"no1melman","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11596","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: SearchQueryService doesnt find System.CommandLine\" (#11596) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nOther/NA\n\n### Product Version\n\nhttps://azuresearch-usnc.nuget.org\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use this version\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\n```\r\nhttps://azuresearch-usnc.nuget.org/query?q=system.commandline\r\n```\r\n\r\nneither\r\n\r\n```\r\nnuget search System.CommandLine\r\n```\r\n\r\n-- compare to --\r\n\r\nnuget.org and search for System.CommandLine which actually shows the package\r\n\r\nwhy can't these be found\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"20276931776","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-15T21:57:17","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11577","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: All the checked sources will be unchecked after pressing Up/Down button in Options dialog\" (#11577) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\nRelease-5.11.x\\5.11.1.15\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

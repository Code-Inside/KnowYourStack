Also, there are several project dependencies between the various projects. Therefore, we need to upgrade everything all at once.\r\n\r\nHowever, instead of having a clean upgrade process, we keep getting `Detected package downgrade` errors, regardless of which \"Install and **Update** Options\" we pick. And the note: \r\n```These options are not applicable to projects managing their dependencies through project.json or PackageReference```\r\n\r\nThis makes no sense since all of our projects use PackageReferences. So, when do these options apply then? \r\n\r\nExample of the error message, and thus the bug:\r\n```\r\nNU1605: Detected package downgrade: F from 9.5.4-b001-Debug to 9.5.4-a015-Debug. \r\nReference the package directly from the project to select a different version. \r\n A -> B -> C -> D -> E 9.5.4-b001-Debug -> F (>= 9.5.4-b001-Debug) \r\n A -> B -> F (>= 9.5.4-a015-Debug)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst issue: the message \"Reference the package directly from the **project** to select a different version.\" \r\n\r\nWhich project? We have 187 of them. Therefore, this message should be changed to specify which project.\r\n\r\nMain Issue:\r\n1. The upgrade rules clearly state that `B` can use any version of `F` that is greater than or equal to `9.5.4-a015-Debug`\r\n2. According to [semver 2.0](https://semver.org/#spec-item-11) sections 11.4.2 & 11.4.4, (assuming we have read the spec correctly) state that the version number `9.5.4-b*` is greater than `9.5.4-a*`.\r\n3. Therefore, `F 9.5.4-b001-Debug` is greater than `F 9.5.4-a015-Debug` which satisfies the upgrade rule (see item 1 above.)\r\n\r\nThus this package should **not** be downgraded. Because of these bogus errors, it is very challenging to upgrade our projects.\r\n\r\nThis behavior also suggests that the Nuget Manager is not following the solution's build dependencies, otherwise `B` would have been upgraded before `A` and this issue would not have existed in the first place."},{"Id":"21640823481","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-05T18:35:27","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11769","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: ServiceUnavailable for slow internet connections when pushing large nuget package\" (#11769) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\nNuGet.exe\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\nNuGet Version: 6.0.0.280\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\nWorks on faster internet connection\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nI'm unable to use this version\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\nCreate large nuget package - size of 222 Mb - 500 Mb.\r\n\r\nYou should be behind bit slower internet connection - I'm behind optical fibre - download 100 MB/s, upload 10 MB/s.\r\n\r\n(Upload is used in this case).\r\n\r\nPush nuget package from your command line:\r\n\r\n`\"...\\tools\\NuGet.CommandLine.6.0.0\\tools\\NuGet.exe\" push largepackage.1.0.0.1.nupkg -Timeout 3600 -src <azure url>`\r\n\r\n```\r\n>NuGet.exe push largepackage.1.0.0.0.nupkg -Timeout 3600 -src <azure devops url>\r\nPushing largepackage.1.0.0.0.nupkg to 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/vcomponents/_packaging/a2b3eb0c-a5a4-439a-ab6f-f4b7cae5213f/nuget/v2/'...\r\n  PUT https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/vcomponents/_packaging/a2b3eb0c-a5a4-439a-ab6f-f4b7cae5213f/nuget/v2/\r\n  ServiceUnavailable https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/vcomponents/_packaging/a2b3eb0c-a5a4-439a-ab6f-f4b7cae5213f/nuget/v2/ 151581ms\r\n  PUT https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/vcomponents/_packaging/a2b3eb0c-a5a4-439a-ab6f-f4b7cae5213f/nuget/v2/\r\n  ServiceUnavailable https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/vcomponents/_packaging/a2b3eb0c-a5a4-439a-ab6f-f4b7cae5213f/nuget/v2/ 153199ms\r\n  PUT https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/vcomponents/_packaging/a2b3eb0c-a5a4-439a-ab6f-f4b7cae5213f/nuget/v2/\r\n  ServiceUnavailable https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/vcomponents/_packaging/a2b3eb0c-a5a4-439a-ab6f-f4b7cae5213f/nuget/v2/ 153575ms\r\nResponse status code does not indicate success: 503 (Service Unavailable).\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndependently of configured timeout transfer fails.\r\n\r\nSame issue can be resolved by using apparently faster internet connection - same issue is reported here:\r\n\r\nhttps://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/service-unavailable-when-pushing-nuget-package-to/867172\r\n\r\nand here:\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.johanpersson.nu/?p=4602\r\n\r\n```>> In order to solve the issue I uploaded the file to my D365FO dev machine and tried the push from there… it worked and it took only a couple of seconds… Wohoo…```\r\n\r\nnuget is also brings down whole internet - while it's traferring the file - it's interfering internet heavily.\r\n\r\n(used speedtest.net)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3228645/164604589-21be32ad-3bca-412b-b3f1-3e1443392b3a.png)\r\n\r\nI think this should be fixed permanently - independently how fast internet connection is - nuget push should not interfere with current internet heavily and must succeeds independently of transfer speed.\r\n\r\nP.S.

type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **lgsndbox** April 21, 2022</sup>\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nWith Visual Studio 2022, I'm trying to automate the building of a Nuget package for a .Net Framework library using MSBuild.\r\nI've followed instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package-msbuild\r\nI understand that a .Net Framework project is a non-SDK-Style project, and I added the necessary `PackageOutputPath` and the `<PackageReference Include=\"NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack\" Version=\"x.x.x\"/>`.\r\n\r\nI'm also using `<GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>`.\r\n\r\nMy problem is the following:\r\nThe Nuget Package is created when I'm on Debug, but not when I'm on Release.\r\n\r\nMy question is:\r\nHow to have it built on Release?\r\n\r\nFor reference here is an expurged version of my .csproj file\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<Project

I must say that I don't understand the purpose of this line anyway.\r\nIt says that if the property `Configuration ` is not defined, define it to `Debug`, but I fail to understand why this has to be done.\r\n[EDIT] I have found the answer to that part here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33744624/set-a-default-build-configuration-for-project\r\n\r\nThanks for any input.\r\n</div>"},{"Id":"21640692512","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-05T18:27:30","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11749","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: Restore from Visual Studio fails after package changes\" (#11749) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Package Manager Console\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\nVS 32413.50.main\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\nVS 17.1\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\nThis happens when I pull changes from man branch that includes package version changes or sometimes target framework changes. A generic repro is:\r\n\r\n- Open a solution from VS, do restore/build.\r\n- Close VS\r\n- Pull changes to the solution (from command line) that changes package versions, target frameworks.\r\n- Open VS and open the solution\r\n- Run \"restore packages\" from solution nodes context menu\r\n\r\nI get `NETSDK1005` errors with description like `Assets file  <json> doesn't have a target for 'netstandard2.0'. Ensure that restore has run and   that you have included 'netstandard2.0' in the TargetFrameworks for your   project.`\r\n\r\nThe only workaround is to run restore from command line and once it succeeds VS continues fine. This impacts build from VS as well.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"20398585964","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T18:32:01","Actor":"clairernovotny","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/61","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Requiring two-factor authentication on NuGet.org\" (#61) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced plans to require tFA on all accounts on NuGet.org.

This is not currently supported with either a tool available to users or to site admins.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new account with the desired username.\r\n2. Add the new account as an owner on packages the old account owns.\r\n3. Accept ownership in the new account and remove the old account from ownership.\r\n4. Optionally, delete the old account.\r\n\r\nThis is workable in most cases but has some problems:\r\n\r\n- It's very painful if the number of accounts is high.\r\n- Other entities like ID prefix reservations or organization memberships are not transferred\r\n- API keys are reset\r\n- You need a second MSA or AAD account for the transition process\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Elevator Pitch\r\n\r\nWe should provide a tool that allows either users or site admins to perform this operation easily.\r\n\r\nThere are issues to consider with this feature:\r\n\r\n- Username changes break client trust policies that use username (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/installing-signed-packages#trust-package-owners)\r\n- The old username should be blocked from usage to prevent impersonation attacks\r\n- Could this be used by spammers or other malicious actors to avoid detection?\r\n- Should we allow as many renames as you want? Or should there be some throttling? If we block old usernames this tool could be used to easily eat up a lot of usernames.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context and Details\r\n\r\nThere is another related request of changing username casing: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5013. This could perhaps be solved at the same time.\r\n\r\nPast requests for a username change on our issue tracker are here:\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4673\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/1838\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/319"},{"Id":"32121857157","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-26T19:10:10","Actor":"mariaghiondea","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9516","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remove unused 'OrganizationsEnabledForAll' file in blob storage\" (#9516) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"'OrganizationsEnabledForAll' property was removed  5 years ago.\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/5822/files\n\nHowever, this property is still in Login-Discontinuation-Configuration.json, it throws exceptions when initialization loginconfiguration.\n\n "},{"Id":"32121833783","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-26T19:09:09","Actor":"mariaghiondea","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9373","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Search-by-TFM Bug Bash] Empty query string parameters should be left out of the url entirely\" (#9373) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Problem description\r\nEmpty query string parameters are included in the url, and the url looks unnecessarily cluttered.\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.nugettest.org/packages?q=&packagetype=&frameworks=&tfms=net472%2Cnet47%2C&prerel=True&sortby=relevance\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nEmpty query string parameters should be left out of the url entirely.\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.nugettest.org/packages?tfms=net472%2Cnet47&prerel=True&sortby=relevance\r\n"},{"Id":"32121829444","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-26T19:08:57","Actor":"mariaghiondea","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9374","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Search-by-TFM Bug Bash] Make filters panel collapsible on mobile devices or narrow screens\" (#9374) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Problem description\r\nThe filters panel appears vertically above the search results on mobile devices and narrow screens, and the important search results are pushed to the bottom of the screen, and the user may even have to scroll to get to them, especially when the TFM sections are expanded.

Open it in Visual Studio and try to search for some NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nUsually, I have one of the three following outcomes:\r\na) VS shows the loading icon forever (I waited for several hours without any updates)\r\nb) VS crashes and restarts itself\r\nc) VS consumes 2.7GM memory, becomes almost unresponsible, and prints the following error: `[dotnet-core] Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.` It looks like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1827\" alt=\"2019-10-29_15-51-32\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2259237/67769671-f294f500-fa65-11e9-81c0-29d0131a3a1f.png\">\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought that something is wrong with the feed. So, I decided to check how it works in [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/):\r\n\r\n![2019-10-29_15-58-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2259237/67769935-6800c580-fa66-11e9-9c3b-9b7f0050d983.gif)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it works perfectly (apart from the fact that Rider consumes several GB to keep the feed data).\r\n\r\nI guess, we have such a situation because Visual Studio is a 32-bit process and it has [RAM limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_GB_barrier) and can't fetch all the data from this feed. In Rider, there is no such limitation because it's a 64-bit process.\r\n\r\nAlso, I tried to fetch the list of the packages with the help of [nuget.exe 5.3.1](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v5.3.1/nuget.exe), but it displays this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nλ nuget.exe list\r\nWARNING: This version of nuget.exe does not support listing packages from package source 'https://dotnetfeed.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet-core/index.json'.\r\nNo packages found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you have any workaround that allows browsing \"huge\" NuGet feeds in Visual Studio? Is Rider the only way to browse such feeds for now?\r\n\r\n## Origin of the problem\r\n\r\nOriginally, I tried to work with Roslyn dev16.3 (you can download the source code from here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/tree/release/dev16.3).

In Rider, there is no such limitation because it's a 64-bit process.\r\n\r\nAlso, I tried to fetch the list of the packages with the help of [nuget.exe 5.3.1](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v5.3.1/nuget.exe), but it displays this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nλ nuget.exe list\r\nWARNING: This version of nuget.exe does not support listing packages from package source 'https://dotnetfeed.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet-core/index.json'.\r\nNo packages found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you have any workaround that allows browsing \"huge\" NuGet feeds in Visual Studio?

What should I pass to pwszAssemblySpec?  \r\n2013-06-08\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's the full name of the assembly (mscorlib, Version=[version], PublicKeyToken=[token], Culture=[culture]). It can either contain all the information (key, version, etc), or just the simple name (\"mscorlib\")  \r\n2013-06-10\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo look like I can only check for the same version of the target framework. Can't check for a later version using this method, because I don't know what future versions will be.  \r\n2013-06-12\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat's fine. That's exactly the behavior we want. For example, System.Runtime didn't ship in 4.0, but did in 4.5. We still want a binding redirect generated for it in 4.0, but not for 4.5.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI followed the exact same steps above, but there's no binding redirect added to the Console Application. It's only added to the __Portable Library project__. Is that the bug?  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe binding redirects added to the Portable Library project seems to come from the Microsoft.Bcl package itself (from the content folder's app.config.transform file). this looks like a non-bug.\r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm chasing up the repro with Eric St. John. He walked through the code and figured out where it was broken.\r\n\r\nIt's the not the app.config.tranform, notice how the net45 content is empty, and hence no transforms. We also marked our transforms with a special marker that indicates that we added the redirects . The binding redirects we were seeing were not coming from us.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAre you seeing the binding redirects added to the Console Application or the Portable Library? I don't see binding redirect added to Console Application, only the Portable Library.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYes I'm talking about the ConsoleApplication. The binding redirects in the portable library project are expected, and do not affect runtime behavior (as the app.config is ignored and not copied to the app project), and hence can't cause an application to crash.\r\n\r\nI've found another repro (NuGet has really weird logic around when it decides to add binding redirects so it was hard to find a repro).\r\n\r\nThe repro is instead of using the Microsoft.Bcl package, install the Microsoft.Net.Http, 2.2.3-beta package. Make sure you are targeting __4.5__ from the ConsoleApplication and the exact platforms that I called out above for portable.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, the ConsoleApplication must be referencing the portable project before installing the package.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK now I can repro  \r\n2013-06-14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK, I've got a fix now. It no longer adds the binding redirect for System.Runtime.dll, but still adds one for System.Net.Http.Primitives. I guess it's expected, right? Please confirm.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\">\r\n<dependentAssembly>\r\n<assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Net.Http.Primitives\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n<bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-4.2.3.0\" newVersion=\"4.2.3.0\" />\r\n</dependentAssembly>\r\n</assemblyBinding>\r\n```  \r\n2013-06-14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nYes that's correct.

Install the Microsoft.Bcl package (1.0.16-rc) to both projects\r\n\r\n@Expected: No binding redirect for System.Runtime in the .NET Framework 4.5 project because a ___later version___ is part of the target framework (see C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETFramework\\v4.5\\RedistList\\FrameworkList.xml)\r\n@Actual: Binding redirect\r\n\r\n<dependentAssembly>\r\n<assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Runtime\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n<bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-1.5.11.0\" newVersion=\"1.5.11.0\" />\r\n</dependentAssembly>\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use the IVsFrameworkMultiTargeting to determine if a given assembly version is available as part of a given target framework.\r\nMake sure when you fix this, that you only skip the binding redirect if ___a later or same version___ is available in the framework.  \r\n2013-02-22\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe'll do this in 2.4 release.  \r\n2013-02-26\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIs IVsFrameworkMultiTargeting.IsReferenceableInTargetFx the method I need to call? What should I pass to pwszAssemblySpec?  \r\n2013-06-08\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's the full name of the assembly (mscorlib, Version=[version], PublicKeyToken=[token], Culture=[culture]). It can either contain all the information (key, version, etc), or just the simple name (\"mscorlib\")  \r\n2013-06-10\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo look like I can only check for the same version of the target framework. Can't check for a later version using this method, because I don't know what future versions will be.  \r\n2013-06-12\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat's fine. That's exactly the behavior we want. For example, System.Runtime didn't ship in 4.0, but did in 4.5. We still want a binding redirect generated for it in 4.0, but not for 4.5.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI followed the exact same steps above, but there's no binding redirect added to the Console Application. It's only added to the __Portable Library project__. Is that the bug?  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe binding redirects added to the Portable Library project seems to come from the Microsoft.Bcl package itself (from the content folder's app.config.transform file). this looks like a non-bug.\r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm chasing up the repro with Eric St. John. He walked through the code and figured out where it was broken.\r\n\r\nIt's the not the app.config.tranform, notice how the net45 content is empty, and hence no transforms. We also marked our transforms with a special marker that indicates that we added the redirects . The binding redirects we were seeing were not coming from us.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAre you seeing the binding redirects added to the Console Application or the Portable Library? I don't see binding redirect added to Console Application, only the Portable Library.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYes I'm talking about the ConsoleApplication. The binding redirects in the portable library project are expected, and do not affect runtime behavior (as the app.config is ignored and not copied to the app project), and hence can't cause an application to crash.\r\n\r\nI've found another repro (NuGet has really weird logic around when it decides to add binding redirects so it was hard to find a repro).\r\n\r\nThe repro is instead of using the Microsoft.Bcl package, install the Microsoft.Net.Http, 2.2.3-beta package. Make sure you are targeting __4.5__ from the ConsoleApplication and the exact platforms that I called out above for portable.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, the ConsoleApplication must be referencing the portable project before installing the package.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK now I can repro  \r\n2013-06-14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK, I've got a fix now. It no longer adds the binding redirect for System.Runtime.dll, but still adds one for System.Net.Http.Primitives. I guess it's expected, right? Please confirm.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\">\r\n<dependentAssembly>\r\n<assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Net.Http.Primitives\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n<bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-4.2.3.0\" newVersion=\"4.2.3.0\" />\r\n</dependentAssembly>\r\n</assemblyBinding>\r\n```  \r\n2013-06-14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nYes that's correct.

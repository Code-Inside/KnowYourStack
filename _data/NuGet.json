Create a dotnet project with a non-trivial set of dependencies.  The simplest I found is a `dotnet new xunit` hello world.\r\n2. Create a `nuget.config` that pulls in a large number of repo sources, e.g. along these lines: https://github.com/dotnet/installer/blob/release/6.0.1xx/NuGet.config\r\n3. Start from an empty nuget cache, i.e. removing `~/.nuget/packages` or  setting `NUGET_PACKAGES` to an empty directory.\r\n4. Run `dotnet restore`\r\n\r\nThis results in many many errors along the lines of:\r\n```\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n  Retrying 'FindPackagesByIdAsync' for source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/system.io.compression/index.json'.\r\n  Too many open files in system (api.nuget.org:443)\r\n    Too many open files in system\r\n  Retrying 'FindPackagesByIdAsync' for source 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/9ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d/_packaging/1e329448-4305-4ce3-bd4c-fb5718f7a5b1/nuget/v3/flat2/system.reflection.extensions/index.json'.\r\n  Too many open files in system (pkgs.dev.azure.com:443)\r\n    Too many open files in system\r\n  Retrying 'FindPackagesByIdAsync' for source 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/9ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d/_packaging/d1622942-d16f-48e5-bc83-96f4539e7601/nuget/v3/flat2/system.reflection/index.json'.\r\n  Too many open files in system (pkgs.dev.azure.com:443)\r\n    Too many open files in system\r\n  Retrying 'FindPackagesByIdAsync' for source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/system.io.compression.zipfile/index.json'.\r\n  Too many open files in system (api.nuget.org:443)\r\n    Too many open files in system\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the test runner framework employed by `dotnet-regular-tests` implicitly performs steps 2) and 3) above; 2) is done to allow testing dotnet prereleases that may pull in dependencies not yet on `nuget.org`, and 3) is done to ensure reproducible results.\r\n\r\n[ Note also that we're only seeing this on the s390x (IBM Z) architecture, not on Intel.  I wasn't able to figure out any platform-specific code difference that might responsible for that - it seems to simply come down to different I/O timing behavior. ]\r\n\r\nInitial investigation with `strace` confirms that the error message is correct: at the time of failure, we do indeed have 1024 open file descriptors, which is the default limit on Linux.  (While it is possible to increase that limit, this is not done by default, since file handles larger than 1024 cannot be processed via `select` due to the fixed size of the `fd_set` data type, and therefore some applications may no longer work correctly if that limit is extended.)\r\n\r\nThose 1024 open file descriptors for the most part appear to originate from about 500 simultaneous connections to various nuget sources, where each such connection uses two file descriptors - one for the TCP socket, and one for a local lock file.  Those connections are (nearly) all about collecting package metadata, i.e. `index.json` files from many versions of many packages across many nuget sources.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, I was able to collect an exception backtrace, and it looks mostly similar to this:\r\n```\r\nat Interop.ThrowExceptionForIoErrno(ErrorInfo errorInfo, String path, Boolean isDirectory, Func`2 errorRewriter)\r\nat

issue - in this scenario, nuget really does have to check all these nuget sources for different versions of the dependent packages, and it is indeed better to run those checks in parallel.  That said, it still would seem preferable to at least limit concurrency to the extent that we don't exceed default system limits.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that there *are* in fact two mechanisms in place that appear to have the intent to limit concurrency just so, but they don't work in this particular use case.\r\n\r\nThe first is a limit imposed by `./src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/HttpSource/HttpSource.cs` by the `throttle` argument to the `HttpSource` constructor: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/419ab86c016778ee3aeab40ea6fee879c09c7365/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/HttpSource/HttpSource.cs#L41\r\nHowever, the default for this throttle appears to be to provide no limitation at all - it gets used only when either the `--disable-parallel` option is given to `dotnet restore`, or if there is a `maxHttpRequestsPerSource` statement in `nuget.config`.\r\nThis actually works (sometimes) for my use case: `--disable-parallel` makes it succeed reliably, but takes are very long time (5 minutes to restore the hello world example); while setting `maxHttpRequestsPerSource` to a low value like 16 makes the restore succeed sometimes (after about 30 seconds), but still fails in other cases, apparently depending on random timing effects.\r\n\r\nThe second mechanism is an extra throttle in `src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/RestoreCommand/SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider.cs` which was apparently added to address a problem with MacOS only supporting 256 open files by default:   https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/419ab86c016778ee3aeab40ea6fee879c09c7365/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/RestoreCommand/SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider.cs#L47\r\nBut this doesn't work either - it's only enabled on MacOS, not Linux, and even if I do enable it, it still doesn't work reliably.  The latter appears to be due to the fact the throttle isn't applied consistently: while *most* uses of the `_findPackagesByIdResource` callbacks are guarded by the throttle, there is one call to `_findPackagesByIdResource.DoesPackageExistAsync` which isn't.  This looks like an oversight to me ...\r\n\r\nIf I add a throttle guard to that call, and enable the throttle on Linux, `dotnet restore` now succeeds reliably, and takes only about 18 seconds for a full restore from an empty nuget cache.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any comments or suggestions on whether this change looks reasonable and might be acceptable upstream, or whether this should be solved in a different way - happy to try other solutions!   For reference, this is the patch I'm currently using - I'd be happy to submit a PR along those lines if you'd like me to.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/RestoreCommand/SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider.cs b/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/RestoreCommand/SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider.cs\r\nindex d859f17fb..4913b1914 100644\r\n--- a/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/RestoreCommand/SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider.cs\r\n+++ b/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/RestoreCommand/SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider.cs\r\n@@ -44,7 +44,7 @@ public class SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider : IRemoteDependencyProvider\r\n         // Limiting concurrent requests to limit the amount of files open at a time on Mac OSX\r\n         // the default is 256 which is easy to hit if we don't limit concurrency\r\n         private readonly static SemaphoreSlim _throttle =\r\n-            RuntimeEnvironmentHelper.IsMacOSX\r\n+            RuntimeEnvironmentHelper.IsMacOSX || RuntimeEnvironmentHelper.IsLinux\r\n                 ? new SemaphoreSlim(ConcurrencyLimit, ConcurrencyLimit)\r\n                 : null;\r\n\r\n@@ -211,8 +211,27 @@ public class SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider : IRemoteDependencyProvider\r\n                 if (libraryRange.VersionRange?.MinVersion != null && libraryRange.VersionRange.IsMinInclusive && !libraryRange.VersionRange.IsFloating)\r\n                 {\r\n                     // first check if the exact min version exist then simply return that\r\n-                    if (await _findPackagesByIdResource.DoesPackageExistAsync(\r\n-                        libraryRange.Name, libraryRange.VersionRange.MinVersion, cacheContext, logger, cancellationToken))\r\n+                    bool versionExists = false;\r\n+                    try\r\n+                    {\r\n+                        if (_throttle != null)\r\n+                        {\r\n+                            await _throttle.WaitAsync();\r\n+                        }\r\n+\r\n+                        versionExists = await _findPackagesByIdResource.DoesPackageExistAsync(\r\n+                            libraryRange.Name,\r\n+                            libraryRange.VersionRange.MinVersion,\r\n+                            cacheContext,\r\n+                            logger,\r\n+                            cancellationToken);\r\n+                    }\r\n+                    finally\r\n+                    {\r\n+                        _throttle?.Release();\r\n+                    }\r\n+\r\n+                    if (versionExists)\r\n                     {\r\n                         return new LibraryIdentity\r\n                         {\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated issues for reference:\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/2004\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/2163\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8571\r\n\r\nFYI @omajid @tmds @crummel\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Mono runtime has been changed to raise the soft RLIMIT_NOFILE on Linux, making the original issue described here no longer appear.  However, as a result of the ongoing discussion, the linked PR still implements two changes to the NuGet.client code base:\r\n\r\n- Add environment variable `NUGET_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` to override OS-specific limit of concurrent connections in SourceRepositoryDependencyProvider.cs.    This allows manually limiting concurrency just in case, e.g. when running in an environment where the OS limit cannot be raised high enough.   Conversely, it would also allow manually *lifting* the automatic limit imposed by NuGet on MacOS, in case it isn't actually needed in some environments.\r\n- Guard `_findPackagesByIdResource.DoesPackageExistAsync` under `_throttle`. Note that all other `_findPackagesByIdResource` callbacks were already guarded under the same `_throttle` to limit concurrency, so the consensus was that this was an oversight.  Adding this additional guard is required to have the concurrency limit work reliably in those cases where it is enabled, e.g. on MacOS or when using the new environment variable.\r\n\r\n### Documentation update\r\n\r\nThe documentation should be updated to describe the new `NUGET_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"27533051139","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-07T00:07:10","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12471","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Feature]: add command dotnet config paths\" (#12471) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"27530972307","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-06T22:05:00","Actor":"rainersigwald","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12470","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Attribute TargetFramework errors to the offending project\" (#12470) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nMSBuild.exe, dotnet.exe\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nIt's possible to get an error like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.100\\NuGet.targets(132,5): error : Invalid framework identifier ''.

Have lots of internal data, logs, etc ... to help track this down. Whomever ends up looking at this can reach me internally at jaredpar@microsoft.com and I can help walk you through the situation if this isn't clear. \r\n\r\nThe rough order of events happening is the following. \r\n\r\n1. `msbuild.exe /t:restore Roslyn.sln`. \r\n2. `msbuild.exe /restore src\\NuGet\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset\\AnyCpu\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset.Package.csproj\r\n`\r\n3. `msbuild.exe /t:Clean src\\NuGet\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset\\AnyCpu\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset.Package.csproj\r\n`\r\n4. `msbuild.exe /t:build /restore /p:BootstrapBuildPath=D:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\artifacts\\Bootstrap Roslyn.sln`\r\n\r\nThe actual commands are significantly more involved (included in verbose section) but that is the gist of commands. The key is the presence of `/p:BootstrapBuildPath`. When this is empty then every project in the solution will have a reference to `Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset` ([source](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/8811477dfe2434bbe3a834ec16eafbb22a298e9e/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk/tools/Compiler.props#L5)). \r\n\r\nThe practical end effect here is that the project.assets.json file produced in step 1 and 2 should be different than the one produced in step 4 as the `<PackageReference>` set is different. The vast majority of projects do restore this way and show the correct values. The bug is that on every run there are a few projects that do not do this and end up with the version from step 1/2. This results in build breaks for us. \r\n\r\nThe easiest demonstration of this behavior is the PR: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/66864. \r\n\r\nNotice that when we use [commit b8ffff](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/66864/commits/b8ffff6677c92be2b15f4183401c1c6080213d55) the [build fails](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng-public/public/_build/results?buildId=170544&view=results) with `ValidateBootstrap` errors (this means restore failed). This failure will go away if we do either of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Before step 4 completely delete the `obj` and `bin` directories. This forces all project.assets.json files to be regenerated and they are done so correctly. To us this suggests there is some timestamp / caching bug at play here. \r\n2. Merge steps 1 + 2 into the same `msbuild.exe` command. I have no explanation for this but it's very easy to demonstrate.\r\n\r\nThis is **very** hard to reproduce locally. To the point we've not been able to successfully do it. We've only been able to observe this via CI but it reproduces 100% there. \r\n\r\nIt's unclear how long this bug has existed. What spawned this investigation is our response to #12373 was to delete static graph restore from our pipelines. The moment we did that we started running into this bug.

From our data we believe this will affect only a small percentage of requests. We will be monitoring all feedback channels during the migration to assess impact and adjust our roll-out timeline as needed.\r\n\r\nBelow, we provide resources to determine whether you will be affected by this change.

Removing one of the `/` at the beginning of `PartName` fixed my publish problem.\r\n\r\nHowever now the package signature doesn't match anymore.\r\n\r\nSo my first question is: Who is to blame? Is NuGet.Server faulty or not tolerant enough? Or is nuget.org not strict enough?\r\nWhich leads to the second question: Is the package actually faulty? I mean, clearly something is odd here.\r\n\r\nBTW: The 5.0.0 package does not have that issue. It only uses one `/`.\r\n\r\nSee also [microsoft.xmlserializer.generator.6.0.0.nupkg fails to upload to nuget.server · Issue #66584 · dotnet/runtime (github.com)](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/66584)\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nTry pushing `microsoft.xmlserializer.generator.6.0.0.nupkg` downloaded from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator/) to a NuGet.Server.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe push succeeds.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"20785028833","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-16T18:07:44","Actor":"dannyjdev","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9058","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[Ally Bug] Installation command copy button reads as table.\" (#9058) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Changes\r\n- Removed `display: table, table-row, table-cell` from css for installation command styles.\r\n  - Since the installation commands had table layouts, NVDA was announcing this button as part of a table, which was not correct.\r\n- Removed unecessary `div` element from `DisplayPackage.cshtml`\r\n\r\n### Addresses\r\nhttps://github.com/nuget/engineering/issues/4315"},{"Id":"20780878664","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-16T14:40:51","Actor":"donet5","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9057","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Feature]:  Query sorting problem\" (#9057) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Related Problem\n\nSuch as\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages?q=sqlsugar  \r\n\r\nHopefully, that's what the search will bring up\r\nSqlSugar\r\nSqlSugarCore\r\n\r\nBut SQLSugarcore won't be on the first page at all\r\n\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nSuch as\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages?q=sqlsugar  \r\n\r\nHopefully, that's what the search will bring up\r\nSqlSugar\r\nSqlSugarCore\r\n\r\nBut SQLSugarcore won't be on the first page at all\r\n\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nSuch as\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages?q=sqlsugar  \r\n\r\nHopefully, that's what the search will bring up\r\nSqlSugar\r\nSqlSugarCore\r\n\r\nBut SQLSugarcore won't be on the first page at all\r\n"},{"Id":"20772183213","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-16T06:37:17","Actor":"jsakamoto","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9060","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: HTML comments `<!-- -->` in a preformatted area of a README markdown text are disappeared\" (#9060) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

A momentary (or not) network issue\r\n   There are 3 incidents. Clearly not nuget's fault. However, when building multiple solutions (which comprise the single enterprise application) it could fail the build after 30 minutes - not fail fast. It is possible to restructure the build to first restore all the packages and then run the build. This way it would fail fast. On the other hand, I wonder if nuget can be told to retry with timeouts in order to survive what could be a short network blackout.\r\n1. IO related failures\r\n   This one is more serious because it seems there is some kind of a race condition when multiple builds running on the same machine try to restore the same packages.\r\n\r\nThe IO issue is very problematic because it can result in a corrupt NuGet package directory with a missing nuspec file. This is a poisonous error - it would not heal itself. The only resolution is to delete the respective NuGet package folder to force its restoration. I specifically excluded this kind of errors from the report, but we had 22 instances of it in the same period of time and they are the worst, because of the manual intervention necessary to fix them.\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce the issue by forcing concurrent restorations with `msbuild /t:restore`, but I am unable to reproduce it reliably. Done about a thousand attempts and only one IO failure occurred - **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\NuGet\\NuGet.targets(131,5): error : The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.** And it is a weird one - no file path is given.\r\n\r\nI would like to know how to troubleshoot these issues? Do we have tools to affect the retries/timeouts for the intermittent network issues? Do we have tools for IO errors? Are there any logs we can turn on to facilitate the IO troubleshooting? The msbuild binary log does not seem very relevant here.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"20805584324","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-17T18:49:38","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11642","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: Locked mode restore does not work as soon as there is another project in the same solution\" (#11642) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\ndotnet 6.0.200\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nI'm unable to use this version\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\n1.

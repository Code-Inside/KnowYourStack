NuGet implicitly calls `IsRunningInVisualStudio` in the `IsMono` check [here](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/e97d556a83750bb4f8017e3640bc699d04832657/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Common/RuntimeEnvironmentHelper.cs#L62), which then queries the BCL for the current process.\r\n\r\n2. On mono, the first time initialization of Process.MainModule takes a long time, and it adds a few seconds to loading a solution in VSMac.\r\n\r\nSee sample trace here: https://gist.github.com/Therzok/9b2e09655e75aa0c4eeec25cc8df2123\r\n\r\nThis could be work-around by only querying `IsRunningInVisualStudio` on `Windows`, as VSMac does not have any `DEVENV` or `BLEND` processes it uses."},{"Id":"13463888672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-09T18:20:00","Actor":"rrelyea","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10015","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Consider removing these NuGet.Configuration public api before 5.8 ships\" (#10015) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Per @zivkan comment in PR: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3649/files/e70389d28297073fc21d7d03a28c27143c66f290#r485233215\n\nConsider approach for codespaces and these apis:\nNuGet.Configuration.IPackageSourceProvider2\nNuGet.Configuration.IPackageSourceProvider2.SavePackageSources(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<NuGet.Configuration.PackageSource> sources, NuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions packageSourceUpdateOptions) -> void\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceProvider.SavePackageSources(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<NuGet.Configuration.PackageSource> sources, NuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions sourceUpdateSettings) -> void\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions.PackageSourceUpdateOptions(bool updateCredentials, bool updateEnabled) -> void\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions.UpdateCredentials.get -> bool\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions.UpdateEnabled.get -> bool\nstatic readonly NuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions.Default -> NuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"12779263648","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-30T21:31:53","Actor":"t-mog-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/46","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Advanced Search on NuGet.org\" (#46) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec for 'Advanced Search on NuGet.org' is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n| Spec wiki | Discussion issue |\r\n| :----------:| :----------------: |\r\n| [Advanced Search on NuGet.org](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Advanced-Search-on-NuGet.org) | [NuGet/NuGetGallery#2636](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/2636) |"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1301620826295410688","CreatedAt":"2020-09-03T20:39:22+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🙌 Community contributor appreciation 🙌\n\nThank you @ztblackgad for your significant code contribution to NuGet!

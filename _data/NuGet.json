Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\NuGet` aren't working well with SourceLink.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you consider NuGet.Commands.dll, the pdb Guid is `69abc799-5795-4e85-9da6-fcc063962cae`, and the Pdb path is `D:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\artifacts\\NuGet.Commands\\obj\\release\\net472\\NuGet.Commands.pdb`. \r\n\r\nI am able to download the pdb

document paths are stored in a format such as `D:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\NuGet.Core\\NuGet.Commands\\SignCommand\\ISignCommandRunner.cs` which can't be used to download the sources from GitHub via SourceLink.\r\n\r\nTo be able to properly debug into NuGet binaries shipping with VS it is important to have SourceLink configured properly, as well as ideally consider portable Pdbs.\r\n\r\n###

`ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` with a package that includes a build task (i.e. `UsingTask`) that is referenced via `GeneratePathProperty` prevents the package from restoring with an `\"ResolvePackageAssets\" task failed unexpectedly` error.\r\n\r\nThe attached repo project includes the package `MSBuild.Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.targets`, which defines a `TransformXml` task. When this task is used in an `AfterTargets=\"BeforeCompile\"` target, the mentioned errors occur (see logs).\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <PackageReference Include=\"MSBuild.Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.targets\" GeneratePathProperty=\"true\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n<UsingTask TaskName=\"TransformXml\"\r\n           AssemblyFile=\"$(PkgMSBuild_Microsoft_VisualStudio_Web_targets)\\tools\\VSToolsPath\\Web\\Microsoft.Web.Publishing.Tasks.dll\"/>\r\n\r\n<Target Name=\"PerformTransform\" AfterTargets=\"BeforeCompile\">\r\n  <TransformXml Source=\"TestFile.xml\" Destination=\"TestFile.xml\" Transform=\"TestFile.xml\" />\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only workaround we've found is to apply a condition on every target that uses the task. e.g. `Condition=\"'$(PkgMSBuild_Microsoft_VisualStudio_Web_targets)' != ''\"`\r\n\r\nThis issue does not occur when not using centrally managed packages.\r\n\r\n[CentralPackagesRepo.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16152071/CentralPackagesRepo.zip)\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\nNuGet package restore failed.

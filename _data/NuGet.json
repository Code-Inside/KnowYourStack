Were you able to clean anywhere?</p>\n<p>The deletion itself doesnâ€™t block on the UI thread, but itâ€™s possible something else is happening because the global packages folder is being cleared (which is where the assemblies are being consumed for intellisense).</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 11/26/2019, 07:05 PM: \n\nWe will close this report in 7 days because we donâ€™t have enough information to investigate further.

In my case, this was only happening when i had the \"Output\" window opened and docked in a split view, separate from my \"Error List\". Once I moved the \"Output\" window back into my tabbed group of windows, the problem went away. </p><p>I noticed something would happen when i clicked \"Clear all NuGet Caches\". My \"Error List\" window would come into focus and my \"Output\" window would attempt to display the package manager ouput. I suspect something between these two UI events are clashing.</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 7/22/2020, 11:33 AM: \n\n<p>Thank you for sharing your feedback!

We've updated a nuget package (from a private feed) and from another project tried to update latest reference of the newly published package. Upon updating get an error \"Package 'PackageName x.x.x.x is not found in the following primary source(s): http...\". This typically means from past experience that the nuget cache needs to be cleared so it can find it. When we hit \"Clear All NuGet Cache(s)\" under Options &gt; Nuget Package Manager &gt; General Visual Studio locks up. I hope this is enough information to re-open this issue.</p>\n\n#### Juha Lehtinen on 2/28/2020, 11:42 PM: \n\n<p>Same issue in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019\nVersion 16.4.5.</p><p>Literally what I did: Open Visual Studio =&gt; Continue without code =&gt; Tools =&gt; Nuget Package Manager =&gt; Clear All NuGet Cache(s).</p><p>The cache is cleared and Visual Studio blocks with high CPU usage and relatively high GPU usage. No way out than killing it.</p><p>Happens every time if Output view is open before clearing the cache. </p><p>Does not happen if Output view is not open before clearing the cache.</p>\n"},{"Id":"12987408614","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-22T17:28:15","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9830","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Should we show requested versions in Consolidate Tab?\" (#9830) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Should we do the same in the Consolidate Tab as in the Install and Update Tab?"},{"Id":"12987380304","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-22T17:25:11","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9829","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Allow to user to input custom (floating) versions through the PM UI\" (#9829) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Change version input to a Combo Box displaying available version depending on the user input.

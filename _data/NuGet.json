But caveat is `concurrent` types are slower than normal ones because it checks for sync locks. So one hand we're making things little bit faster due to parallelization but other hand making some things slower for other uses, there're 2 sides of coin, hard to evaluate right away.\nWe can't make it immutable types because most cache are intended for mutation. \nAnother issue is almost all `cacheContext`s are part of public API. Not sure how to handle it without breaking. One possible solution is create new ones and deprecate old ones.\n"},{"Id":"13838246061","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-10-14T05:50:17","Actor":"vsfeedback","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10120","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The 'Package' Build tab specifies an icon using a property that was deprecated by NuGet\" (#10120) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/793034/the-package-build-tab-specifies-an-icon-using-a-pr.html)._\n\n---\nWhen building a C# library, in project properties -> Package tab, we specify all the properties for the package. Here we can specify an icon for the package. The only way to specify the icon in this tab is by filling the 'Icon URL' text box.

We can even place warning suppressions in a central location to ensure that we have common documentation / tracking of why we need to suppress certain warnings.\r\n\r\nWhen using central package versioning with transitive pinning, this unfortunately breaks down. We need to go either suppress warnings globally (not great for a large and active repo) or explicitly include the reference which defeats the purpose of using transitive pinning in the first place.\r\n\r\nCan we update ``<PackageVersion>`` to support ``<NoWarn>`` and have centralized tracking / suppression of warnings for specific packages?\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nThe repo I work on uses Microsoft.Build.CentralPackageVersions but we're looking to migrate to the built-in central package versioning feature instead.\r\n\r\nWe currently have some issues with transitive dependencies, requiring us to explicitly include packages in order to control the version -- exactly the problem which ``<CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>`` solves which means we have an opportunity to de-clutter the repo by migrating.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we also depend on older NuGet packages that do not yet support .Net Core. That means we have a couple of package declarations where we need to suppress NU1701. We can do all this in a central location, i.e. in .csproj files we'd have something like\r\n\r\n````\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"LegacyPackage\">\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd in Packages.props\r\n````\r\n<PackageReference Update=\"LegacyPackage\" Version=\"1.0.0\">\r\n  <!-- \r\n    Suppress NU1701 for this package. It does not yet support .Net Core, but does not use any .Net Framework\r\n    specific APIs at runtime and should be okay to use.\r\n    Upstream work tracked by https://github.com/...\r\n  -->\r\n  <NoWarn>NU1701</NoWarn>\r\n</PackageReference>\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhen we move to central package versioning with transitive pinning we can do the equivalent by placing the item update directive in Directory.Build.targets, and the .csproj which explicitly declares the reference suppress the warning as expected. Unfortunately every downstream project now trigger NU1701.\r\n\r\nAdding the reference to downstream projects of course pick up the suppression as expected, but then we're again explicitly adding upstream references.\r\n\r\nIf we could add the ``<NoWarn>`` on the relevant ``<PackageVersion>`` item, we'd be able to track everything package-related in one central file just like we do with Microsoft.Build.CentralPackageVersion"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"29730541084","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-13T19:08:21","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/69","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE 2023-29337 | NuGet Client Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\" (#69) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2023-29337 | NuGet Client Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET and NuGet on Linux.

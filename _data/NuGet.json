Open a Terminal window and execute:\r\n    `    openssl pkcs12 -in <PfxFilePath> -out <PemFilePath> -nokeys`\r\n        When prompted, enter the PFX password.\r\n    c. Open the PEM file created in step 3.\r\n   d. Copy the entire block labelled with BEGIN CERTIFICATE/END CERTIFICATE:\r\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\n…\r\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n\r\n  e. In the versioned directory of your patched .NET SDK open ./trustedroots/codesignctl.pem.\r\n  f. At the end of the file on a new blank line, paste the copied certificate in PEM format.\r\n  g. Save the file.\r\n\r\n8. Create a project, add package reference in the .csproj file\r\n```\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"<packageName>\" Version=\"<packageVersion>\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n9. Add the feed (path contains the signed package), set required mode in nuget.config file with trusted signers list:\r\n  ```\r\n  <packageSources>\r\n      <add key=\"<anyname>\" value=\"<signed package parent folder>\" />\r\n     <add key=\"nuget.org\" value=\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\" protocolVersion=\"3\" />\r\n   </packageSources>\r\n   <config>\r\n    <add key=\"signatureValidationMode\" value=\"require\" />\r\n   </config>\r\n  <trustedSigners>\r\n     <author name=\"JamieZhang\">       \r\n         <certificate fingerprint=\"AAAAA\" hashAlgorithm=\"SHA256\" allowUntrustedRoot=\"false\" />\r\n     </author>\r\n  </trustedSigners>\r\n```\r\n10. Clear the cache: <patchedSDKPath>`./dotnet nuget locals all –clear`.\r\n11. Delete the <projectPath>/obj folder if there is any.\r\n12. Set the envrioment:\r\n  `export DOTNET_NUGET_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION=true`\r\n13. Go inside the project folder, verify the package by running restore: <patchedSDKPath>`./dotnet restore <projectpath>/<projectname>.csproj`\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\nThe expected error/warning should show after restoring the project.\r\n\r\n## Actual\r\nThe expected error/warning disappeared after restoring the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_"},{"Id":"30965767239","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-08-08T08:18:20","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10015","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"16.10: remove package source 1.0 service. remove obsolete APIs (in nuget.configuration that we added in 16.8)\" (#10015) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Per @zivkan comment in PR: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3649/files/e70389d28297073fc21d7d03a28c27143c66f290#r485233215\n\nConsider approach for codespaces and these apis:\nNuGet.Configuration.IPackageSourceProvider2\nNuGet.Configuration.IPackageSourceProvider2.SavePackageSources(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<NuGet.Configuration.PackageSource> sources, NuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions packageSourceUpdateOptions) -> void\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceProvider.SavePackageSources(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<NuGet.Configuration.PackageSource> sources, NuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions sourceUpdateSettings) -> void\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions.PackageSourceUpdateOptions(bool updateCredentials, bool updateEnabled) -> void\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions.UpdateCredentials.get -> bool\nNuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions.UpdateEnabled.get -> bool\nstatic readonly NuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions.Default -> NuGet.Configuration.PackageSourceUpdateOptions"},{"Id":"30965767104","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-08-08T08:18:19","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disabling nuget.org in VS options creates a second nuget.org in nuget.config\" (#12776) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\n17.8 preview 1\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

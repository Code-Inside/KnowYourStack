I don't have a minimized repro but I believe it looks something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Call `RestoreTask` in one project.\r\n2. In the same MSBuild build session, call `RestoreTask` in another project.\r\n3. Experience MSBuild crash `MSB0001: Internal MSBuild Error: ContextID 10 should have been in the ID-to-project file mapping but wasn't!`\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWhat's happening here is this:\r\n\r\n1. The first call to `RestoreTask` creates a new NuGet `ILogger` wrapping a `Microsoft.Build.Utilities.TaskLoggingHelper` associated with that task invocation -- call this logger `$1`.\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/840b09a4cecda6ae8fd1c07967874fe8061ece63/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks/RestoreTask.cs#L103\r\n1. `RestoreTask.ExecuteAsync()` calls [`DefaultCredentialServiceUtility.SetupDefaultCredentialService`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/840b09a4cecda6ae8fd1c07967874fe8061ece63/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Credentials/DefaultCredentialServiceUtility.cs#L17-L28), passing that logger.\r\n1. That populates the **static** field [`HttpHandlerResourceV3.CredentialService`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/840b09a4cecda6ae8fd1c07967874fe8061ece63/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/HttpSource/HttpHandlerResourceV3.cs#L40), preserving a link to the `TaskLoggingHelper` in an object with a longer lifetime than the task.\r\n1. The first `RestoreTask` completes.\r\n1. MSBuild tears down logging infrastructure required to log messages from the context of the first `RestoreTask`. Normally this would make `$1` eligible for GC, but it's now referenced from a static.\r\n1. The second `RestoreTask` is called.\r\n1. On this pass through, `HttpHandlerResourceV3.CredentialService` is non-null and not reset to the current `TaskLoggingHelper`.\r\n1. The credential provider is invoked and attempts to log (using `$1`).\r\n1. MSBuild crashes because of the logging infrastructure teardown from step 5."},{"Id":"10639378782","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-16T03:27:47","Actor":"kartheekp-ms","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8679","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Showing message like \" Blocked by package.config\"\" (#8679) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"In VS Manage Nuget Packages window, When choose nuget from browse and see the listed versions, the message showing like   **Blocked by package.config** after under this message all the version again listed.

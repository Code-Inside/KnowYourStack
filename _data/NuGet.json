In CSharp projects NuGet package for multiple projects can be accessed from a single location using NuGet's central package management (CPM) features. But in CppWinRT project this is not working as expected because package.config file is version dependent.\n2.\t**Issue**\nIn WinUI3 CppWinRT application we can only update package versions manually using Manage NuGet Packages.

We tried Central Package Management to centrally manage package dependencies in project. Using Central Package Management version dependency from project file is removed but again issue occurred as version dependency from package.config cannot be removed.\n•\tInstead of removing versions from package.config we tried to copy updated packages.config to root folder in prebuild events but this also failed as NuGet restore operations occurs before prebuild events.\n4.\t**Query**\nIs there a method to make package.config version independent or update the versions in package.config automatically.\n\n5.\t**Testing Environment**\n•\tWindows OS version\t: 22H2\n•\tOS Build\t\t\t: 19045.5011\n•\tVisual Studio Version\t: VS 2022,17.4.4\n\nSample application is attached:\n[SampleApp.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17659889/SampleApp.zip)\n"},{"Id":"44075343115","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-11-21T21:51:36","Actor":"jebriede","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13955","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Add support for add/update/delete auditsources in Visual Studio options UI\" (#13955) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nThe NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio allows you to add/update/delete package sources for your nuget.config directly in the options dialog:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad315a47-39d3-4dea-80b5-789015f13cbc)\r\n\r\nWhat is absent from this UI is the ability to manage auditsources.

To prevent copying of the DevExpress dlls to the output folder, those packages were originally configured as ExcludeAssets=runtime. This was done because the dlls end up being pulled into a different folder in the output tree through another project and this library is enhancing that one. The whole application is published later on via ClickOnce, so there cannot be duplicates anywhere on the folder published.\r\n\r\nWhen having both frameworks, the designer run as for Framework and everything was OK. When having only NET 8 Windows, the designer seems to need to consume the content of the lib folder for all DevExpress packages or the in-place designer in VisualStudio does not work. So ExcludeAssets=runtime does not work anymore. After removing that, the designer works but dlls start appearing in folders where they should not be (and causing ClickOnce issues). \r\n\r\nI tested several combinations of asset configurations, just in case the tag or the asset was being used wrong, but there does not seem to be a way to have the contents in the lib folder used for the designer but not copy them out to the output folder.\r\n\r\nCombinations tested:\r\nIncludeAssets: (default); PrivateAssets: (default), ExcludeAssets: (default) -> Dlls copied, Designer works\r\nIncludeAssets: (default); PrivateAssets: (default), ExcludeAssets: runtime -> Dlls not copied, Designer does not works\r\nIncludeAssets: (default); PrivateAssets: runtime, ExcludeAssets: (default) -> Dlls copied, Designer works\r\nIncludeAssets: (default); PrivateAssets: all, ExcludeAssets: (default) -> Dlls copied, Designer works\r\nIncludeAssets: compile; PrivateAssets: all, ExcludeAssets: (default) -> Dlls not copied, Designer doesn't work\r\nIncludeAssets: compile;runtime; PrivateAssets: all, ExcludeAssets: (default) -> Dlls copied, Designer works\r\nIncludeAssets: compile;runtime; PrivateAssets: all, ExcludeAssets: runtime -> Dlls not copied, Designer doesn't work\r\n\r\nFor reference, the nupkg for the  NuGet packages referenced looks as follows:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dfcf3d5-a941-4e05-81cf-f0f86763f010)\r\n\r\nAnd the DesignToolsError\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cfaabe7-3e04-4fcc-b99f-aca4a41cfe32)\r\n\r\nOpening the report here, as it's not clear if the issue is the NuGet package assets configuration or if it's how VS and the .NET designer use them.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"44068002776","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-11-21T17:42:03","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13952","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Targeting Net8.0 within an Azure Functions project causes NuGet to restore old vulnerable packages\" (#13952) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Package Management UI, Visual Studio Package Manager Console\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 17.12\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\nNo. Version 17.11.6 did not work either\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nI'm unable to use this version\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**  \r\n\r\n1.

The test is scheduled to begin at **EDT 01:00 PM** and is expected to last between **24 to 72 hours**. We will adjust the test duration based on customer feedback.\r\n\r\nDuring the scream test, **Alpine Linux** customers may encounter **DNS failures** from the [V3 API](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-org/overview-nuget-org#api-endpoint-for-nugetorg) due to this [issue](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9736). To mitigate, we recommend that Alpine Linux customers migrate to **Alpine Linux 3.18.0** or a newer version. These newer versions support **TCP fallback** in the DNS resolver.\r\n\r\nTo ensure uninterrupted service during the test, please use the [V2 API](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-org/overview-nuget-org#api-endpoint-for-nugetorg) instead.\r\n\r\nIf you have any **feedback**, **concerns**, or **questions**, feel free to reach out to us at support@nuget.org or by commenting on the discussion issue: [NuGet/Home#12985](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/discussions/12985)."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2024-11-23T03:30:19.5244385Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":968}

Use a custom package in the project that only exists in the custom feed, but don't configure it in the Package Source Mapping.\r\n3.

Such dependencies are usually not intended to be brought along transitively, so the NU1608 error is less likely to occur.\r\n* `GlobalPackageReference`s are more likely to be used with a floating version in the first place, in my opinion. In my scenario, I'm maintaining a handful of libraries which use a shared package (also maintained by me) of build scripts and analyser configurations, so that I don't have to duplicate `props` and `globalconfig` settings across a bunch of repositories. I'd like to use a floating version for that shared package so that I can make adjustments to the build scripts and not have to update all of the dependent repositories.\r\n\r\n(For what it's worth, I think there are cases other than `GlobalPackageReference` where these arguments apply, too, such as test frameworks.

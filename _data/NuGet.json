The Prerelease url parameter sometimes had an uppercase boolean ('True') and sometimes a lowercase boolean ('true'). It will always show a lowercase boolean now. \r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9367\r\n2. The frameworks and tfms parameters were being added to the query string in the order that the user selected them, rather than the order of the checkboxes in the UI. This has been fixed.\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9368\r\n3. The frameworks and tfms parameters always ended in a comma (`net,` ; `net5.0,net472,`). This has been fixed.\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9369\r\n4. Previously, all TFM sections were always collapsed when the page loaded. Now, if any individual TFMs have been selected, their TFM sections will be expanded when the page loads.\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9370\r\n5. The packageType query parameter was before frameworks and tfms in the url, but appears after them in the UI. This has been fixed so that the frameworks and tfms params appear before packageType in the url.\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9371\r\n6. The box around the framework generation collapsible arrows (when they're selected/in focus) was distorted by the box below it. Some of the bottom part of the box was hidden. This has been fixed.\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9375\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** Added a small fix that addresses 2 other bugs:\r\n1. Search bar disappears on the Profiles page. We needed to remove the default search bar on the Search page, but the search bar was being removed from the Profiles page too with the same javascript code. We now use a ViewBag property, the same way that the [Home page](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/60fc5d5b8a5211a47d3722199ff459e660c59823/src/NuGetGallery/Views/Pages/Home.cshtml#L4) does, instead of javascript. With these changes, the search bar removal will only happen on the Search page.\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9377\r\n2. An extra Search bar flickers before disappearing when the search page is rendering. The switch from the javascript code to the ViewBag property fixes this too.\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9376"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"26991183929","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-02-09T20:03:35","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12405","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nuget package installation with  --interactive option has different flags for IsNonInteractive flag (sdk 7.0.102 vs 7.0.2xx-preview1)\" (#12405) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\n7.0.102\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\nYes, it works in Net 6.0 and in sdk 7.0.2xx-preview1\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nI'm unable to use this version\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps & Context\r\n\r\nThe initial ticket was cleated in templating repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues/6020\r\n\r\nWe were able to repro locally and the only difference in the outputs that influence the result is **IsNonInteractive** values.

A fix would be nice\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nNU5104 basically says that SemVer stable versions of packages should not take dependencies on prelreease versions of packages. According to https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6434#issuecomment-1323572424 this warning triggers when the version range `[1.0.0, 2.0.0-0)` is specified.\r\n\r\nHowever, and upper exclusive range of `2.0.0-0` explicitly means that no pre-release version of 2.0.0 will match since `-0` is the lowest possible prerelease version, and exclusive bound means that it won't allow the exact match. Therefore, the `-0` and the NU5104 are trying to achieve the exact same thing, so it shouldn't be warning.\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"26985296367","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-02-09T15:45:11","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12423","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Warning when version range upper version does not end in `-0`\" (#12423) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nNuGet.exe, MSBuild.exe, dotnet.exe\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nAccording to SemVer2, 1.0.0 < 2.0.0-alpha < 2.0.0.  But customers frequently use range `[1.2.3, 2.0.0)` hoping to limit the range to `1.x`, but this doesn't take into account pre-release versions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose a warning when:\r\n* it finds a package where an upper version is specified\r\n* the upper version is not inclusive (`)` rather than `]`)\r\n* the upper version does not have a prerelease label, then a warning is shown.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to:\r\n\r\n> Warning NUxxxx: Package Contoso.Utilities requests versions [1.2.3, 2.0.0) but will match pre-release version such as 2.0.0-alpha. To exclude prerelease versions, change the version range to [1.2.3, 2.0.0-0)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this should only be a pack warning (dependency version), only be a restore warning (PackageReference version), or both.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nConsider issues like:\r\n* https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6434\r\n* https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12082\r\n\r\nI agree that the behaviour is non-intuitive, and that many customers would prefer the version range comparison to exclude the pre-release versions instead, but it's a breaking change whose magnitude of impact is unknown. This proposal could help package authors in particular minimize risk that their packages claim compatibility with pre-release packages."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"26018738970","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-12-21T10:42:59","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/67","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bi5mynlyl2b3a16/nutrition.pdf?dl=0\" (#67) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"This repo doesn't accept issues.

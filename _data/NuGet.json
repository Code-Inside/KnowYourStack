For example, I've suppressed a warning or set of warnings in Directory.Build.props so every project has the exact same set.  Can we use the same object for each project in that case?  Essentially we'd only allocate a new instance if a project had a different set and then cache it somehow?\r\n\r\nOr perhaps we could change the GetIntersect function to have a special case for Equals.  If just the hash sets or dictionaries are equal just reuse that, and if both are equal reuse the entire NodeWarningProperties object.  Right now it handles the ReferenceEqual scenario, but not value-equal.  Perhaps this could be fit into the IsSubset check so we don't have to scan through the object a second time?\r\n\r\n(Inspired by https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4644)\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"22315890681","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-13T22:03:44","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8713","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGet 5.3 issues a warning for the dependency group when it is specified (NU5128)\" (#8713) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet issues a warning NU5128 when csproj is specified as a target and nuspec with the same file name exists in the same directory as csproj file, and has the dependency group specified.\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): NuGet.exe\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): 5.3.0.6260\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe --version (if appropriate): 3.0.100\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): Visual Studio 2019 Professional\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): win10 (17134)\r\n\r\nWorked before?

For example, within a Cake build, a user can reference the [Polly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly/) NuGet package, and leverage all of its features, defining and executing different Polly policies.\r\n\r\nNuGet packages can be used in Cake in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n- As a regular NuGet package (Package Reference, packages.config, NuGet Package Manager UI, etc.) on a [Console application](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting).\r\n\r\n- As a **[Cake Addin](https://cakebuild.net/docs/extending/addins/)** (`#addin`). In short, this means: Download the NuGet package, and load the assemblies within it into the host process executing the build process. Virtually any NuGet package containing .NET assembly(ies) can be loaded as a Cake Addin. e.g. `#addin nuget:?package=Polly&version=7.2.1`\r\n\r\n- As a **[Cake Tool](https://cakebuild.net/docs/writing-builds/tools/installing-tools)** (`#tool`). In short, this means: Download the NuGet package, and extract its contents to a folder, so that its files become available to the build process. Virtually any NuGet package can be loaded as a Cake Tool. e.g. `#tool nuget:?package=7-Zip.CommandLine&version=18.1.0`\r\n\r\n- As a **[Cake Module](https://cakebuild.net/docs/extending/modules/)** (`#module`). In short, this is very similar to Cake Addin, with the exception that modules are loaded earlier in the lifecycle and can replace and/or add Cake features that can be leveraged by the build process later. e.g. `#module nuget:?package=Cake.Npm.Module&version=0.1.0`\r\n\r\n- As a **[Cake Recipe](https://cakebuild.net/docs/writing-builds/reusing-builds#recipe-nuget-packages)** (`#load`). In short, this means: Download a NuGet package containing Cake scripts, and merge these scripts into the current build, allowing for sharing of reusable snippets of code.  e.g. `#load nuget:?package=Cake.Recipe&version=2.1.0`\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nWe'd like to display installation instructions on how to use NuGet packages with Cake, in the NuGet Gallery, on a new tab with the title \"Cake Build\", which would display a tailored set of instructions if a package is detected as being built specifically for use with Cake ([Cake Extension](https://cakebuild.net/docs/extending/)) or generic instructions otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe criteria we'd like to use for detecting if a package as built specifically for use with Cake would be the presence of specific `tags` in the package metadata:\r\n\r\n### Cake Addin\r\n\r\n- If a package contains the tag `cake-addin`, we assume its author meant for this package to be consumed as a Cake Addin. As such we would show a tailored instruction to install as a Cake Addin:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177608/104796691-f60dbc80-578e-11eb-8f43-ba4f294f80d9.png)\r\n\r\n### Cake Module\r\n\r\n- If a package contains the tag `cake-module`, we assume its author meant for this package to be consumed as a Cake Module . As such we would show a tailored instruction to install as a Cake Module:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177608/104796701-10e03100-578f-11eb-9591-f1ea1a7d1ba3.png)\r\n\r\n### Cake Recipe\r\n\r\n- If a package contains the tag `cake-recipe`, we assume its author meant for this package to be consumed as a Cake Recipe.

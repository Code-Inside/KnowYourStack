The decision was \"try to use a temp project and restore the package for now\". However, after using this mechanism for 2 years. We still wish to have a C\\# API to do restore, especially considering we would reuse the dotnet tool install component to install dotnet SDK workloads. Dotnet SDK workloads installation experience needs to be bulletproof or the user will be blocked using Xamarin.\r\n\r\n## Issues for existing temp project approach\r\n\r\n1.  Multiple IO operation and process hops caused unreliability and they are very hard to reproduce and resolve. First a file needs to be written to the disk. And a restore in a separate process need to write more files. The following 2 issues are likely caused by race conditions. However, I cannot reproduce them. The cleanup of the temporary files is also tricky.\r\n\r\n    a.  [.NET 5: Unable to install some .NET tools (dotnet tool install) · Issue \\#14547 · dotnet/sdk (github.com)](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/14547)\r\n\r\n    b.  [Failed to install tool package \\... · Issue \\#11459 · dotnet/sdk (github.com)](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/11459)\r\n\r\n2.  Hard-to-act-on error messages. Because the communication between SDK and nuget restore is via the command line. When error happens, SDK can only redirect the output of nuget and SDK cannot give a more specific guidance for the user to act on. That results the long list of \"probably this happened.\" <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/troubleshoot-usage-issues#executable-file-not-found>\r\n\r\n3.  Environment leak in. Because there is an explicit msbuild run. Environment variables get leaked in. There is no good way to prevent them.\r\n\r\n    a.

Escape unescaped madness. Because the communication is done via the command line. SDK need to carefully escape/unescape characters. It is not trivial and error prone.\r\n\r\n## Requirement\r\n\r\nIt should be a replacement for the [temp project](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/b91b88aec2684e3d2988df8d838d3aa3c6240a35/src/Cli/dotnet/ToolPackage/ToolPackageInstaller.cs#L179). It should select correct TFM and generate asset.json. However, if we can get an API that can simply download package to a specific location, that would fit net6.0 requirement. But it won't help us making tools experience better.\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"15596835672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T16:16:18","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/55","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package Namespaces Proposal\" (#55) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Introduction of a feature concept called Package Namespaces which allows a developer to include or exclude package IDs by specifying package namespaces on their package source(s).\r\n\r\n🎉📦Please provide your comments, concerns, and feedback within this PR. 📦🎉\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/10660"},{"Id":"15469893086","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:14:19","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/54","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Custom V2 OData queries will be deprecated March 9th, 2021 \" (#54) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (#37) last year and conducted a dry run of the deprecation to ensure that there are no surprises for users (#40). \r\n\r\nWe will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in March 9, 2021, as detailed in [the blogpost here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/custom-v2-odata-queries-will-be-deprecated-march-9-2021/).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know about your questions or concerns on [this discussion post.](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7423)"},{"Id":"15322501248","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-25T20:01:29","Actor":"chgill-MSFT","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/53","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021\" (#53) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021.

So I naturally tried the various common ways to get the help output:\r\n```\r\nnuget /?\r\nnuget -?\r\nnuget --?\r\nnuget -help\r\nnuget /help\r\nnuget --help\r\n```\r\nAll of them returned:\r\n```\r\nUnknown command: '/?'\r\nNuGet.CommandLine.CommandLineException: Unknown command: '/?'\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.CommandManager.GetCommand(String commandName)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.CommandLineParser.ParseCommandLine(IEnumerable`1 commandLineArgs)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.Program.MainCore(String workingDirectory, String[] args)\r\n```\r\nInstead it turns out the command is\r\n`nuget help` or `nuget ?`\r\nThis is a bit against common convention.\r\nHowever it gets weirder. I needed help for the `nuget config` command, so now having learned you add `help` without a dash, I entered this:\r\n```\r\nc:\\>nuget config help\r\nKey 'help' not found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt turns out that in this specific case, you must use a dash in front of the command: `nuget config -help`\r\n\r\nThis is rather inconsistent. The quick fix would allow `nuget -help`  and `nuget -?` (or forward slash on Windows) to be the common documented approach, as it's in alignment with common conventions, and also aligns with other help commands in the nuget cli.\r\n\r\nI later realized you can also do `nuget help config`, but again I've found it more common you ask for help after the command you want help with, and not the other way around.\r\n\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: `NuGet.exe`\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx):  `5.1.0.6013`\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): `Win10 v1809 17763.529`\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"13668756700","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-28T23:55:58","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1589","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nuget.exe sources add does not work if nuget.config does not have proper section\" (#1589) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"The sources add command does not add the package source into the nuget config if the nuget.config  doesn’t already have both a <clear/> element and an existing package source.

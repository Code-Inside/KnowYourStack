I was only able to test it within our company with our companies AD. To use it, you have to configure the `Auth.LdapUser` block in the `Web.config` file.\r\n\r\nWhen `Auth.LdapUser.Enabled`, the register form is used to check the given credentials (username and password) and if the credentials are valid, it creates a new account with the username as `ldap.user` credentials instead of saving the password with `password.v3` credentials. No password credentials will be created for this account. If you want to use `LdapUser` with the current password as `LocalUser` fallback, you can just add the credentials to the account in `AuthenticationService.cs` right after the `CreateIdentity` was called (around line 252). This may be something to make configurable.\r\n\r\nIf you only want to support LDAP without regular passwords (i.e. when you are setting up a new server), I advise you to set `Auth.LocalUser.Enabled` in `Web.config` to `false`. They can coexist, since they both have an own cookie, but in most cases, you really only want to have either LDAP or local users.\r\n\r\nRight now, there is no migration path to change existing user credentials from `password.v3` to `ldap.user`. In case the NuGet username already matches the LDAP username, the easiest way would be to update the `dbo.Credentials` entries for `password.v3` and set `Type`= `ldap.user` and `Value` = `(SELECT [Username] FROM [Users] WHERE [Key] = [UserKey])`.\r\n\r\n**Tests are currently missing. I didn't want to put in the effort in case that it won't be merged. So I will add them, in case that there are no points speaking against merging.**"},{"Id":"20883002738","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-22T23:47:40","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/5841","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Adds machine learning-generated recommendations to each package's page\" (#5841) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Have not built or tested yet, please do not merge.\r\n\r\nContributes to https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5751 (since this is hopefully just the initial stage of the feature, I won't write \"fixed\" just yet :wink:)\r\n\r\n/cc @shishirx34 @scottbommarito "},{"Id":"20882979912","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-22T23:45:07","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/2953","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Add github information on the package page\" (#2953) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Two node.js applications, one to look at all nuget packages, determine which have github URLs and add these to an azure queue.

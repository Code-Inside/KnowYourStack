In most cases this doesn't matter because TLS 1.2 hasn't been deprecated yet but I encountered a problem on a network which uses Palo Alto firewalls to do SSL inspection. The Palo Alto implementation has a long-running lack of support for RFC 5746 (I found references going back at least 3 years) which causes session negotiation with newer versions of OpenSSL to fail with a hard error (`error:0A000152:SSL routines::unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled`) when a server supports TLS 1.2 but not 1.3.\r\n\r\n\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nIt's possible to configure OpenSSL to ignore this warning but I prefer not to train people to weaken security and since it's likely that TLS 1.3 adoption will become advisable at some point in the future, wanted to suggest that enabling it now could simplify life for a certain subset of users.

A bearer token is a single credential without defined username and password values, although many bearer tokens contain username-like information as claims and the token itself (or the hashed component of a JWT) can be seen in some ways as a \"password\" or secret value.\r\n\r\nIf a `GetAuthenticationCredentialsResponse` is returned by a credential provider with a `Bearer` authentication method, it is never used by the .NET authentication stack, despite the NuGet `SecurePluginCredentialProvider` type receiving the response and adding it to the credential cache.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for the issue to be worked around by stuffing a token into a basic auth credential as the password and using an arbitrary value for the username. This is what the Azure DevOps credential provider does here: https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider/blob/dc5f4a2da94af69f444b5fd709e889dce23ac026/CredentialProvider.Microsoft/CredentialProviders/Vsts/VstsCredentialProvider.cs#L162-L167 (this code stuffs a session token as a basic auth credential and uses `VssSessionToken` as the username)\r\n\r\nIt would allow better tooling support and 3rd party client support if the NuGet protocol supported `Bearer`  token auth instead of just `Basic`. For example, integrated OAuth 2.0 support in Postman or Insomnia could work seamlessly with a package source supporting bearer tokens. A first step in this would be to unlock credential provider support for bearer tokens.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nI've created a sample credential provider that stuffs a JWT into `Basic` auth and this gets sent to the server. However all nice OAuth 2.0 server-side libraries expect the JWT to be in the form of `Authorization: Bearer {JWT}` not `Authorization: Basic {base64(\"username:\" + JWT)}\"`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/joelverhagen/TestCredentialProvider/blob/b86ca3eeaf570f6b75785f9517dc820e9daf3896/TestCredentialProvider/Program.cs#L82-L100\r\n\r\nThis means you need custom handling on the server-side to unpack the JWT token from the Basic auth header and pass it into the OAuth validation routine (or whatever other routine needed for the bearer token).\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to support an environment variable hook like `NUGET_BEARER_TOKEN` which, if present, sets the request header `Authorization: Bearer {NUGET_BEARER_TOKEN}`. I think this is a worse option since it means long-lived processes like IDEs will not work since the bearer token environment variable will expire and the client won't have a way to get a new one."},{"Id":"31710594981","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-09T08:03:03","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12855","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGetAudit: read vulnerability files with System.Text.Json\" (#12855) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\nMSBuild.exe, dotnet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe initial implementation of NuGetAudit was done quickly, to meet shipping dates.

So, a once-off 1ms saving isn't going to be noticeable to anyone. However, perhaps in a real restore, when other work is happening on other threads, reducing GC pauses will have a more significant impact.\r\n\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThings to check:\r\n\r\n* Does MSBuild already ship System.Text.Json.dll, or do we have to include it in our VSIX for MSBuild CLI scenarios?\r\n* Risk of VS perf test regression if nothing else loads System.Text.Json.dll in a measured scenario. It's not feasible to port ALL Newtonsoft.Json usage to System.Text.Json in one PR, so from NuGet's perspective it will be an additional assembly loaded. However, there is a very good chance that some VS platform component, like settings, accounts, etc, already uses System.Text.Json, so the assembly will probably be loaded already.\r\n* Any other compliance work?"},{"Id":"31710418448","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-09T07:32:29","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12875","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGetAudit should not warn when no vulnerability data is available\" (#12875) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\nMSBuild.exe, dotnet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWith the initial previews of NuGetAudit, when none of the package sources have vulnerability data, and the project explicitly enables NuGetAudit (as opposed to enabled by default), then NuGet raises the NU1905 warning.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nDon't warn.

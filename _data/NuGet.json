This would allow NuGet to provide greater visibility into DMCA complaints and improve transparency within the .NET OSS ecosystem.\n\n### Proposal\nIn addition to implementing a transparent DMCA process, it would be beneficial to improve the granularity of abuse reporting categories for NuGet packages. The current reporting categories, such as those shown in NuGet's reporting system (e.g., copyright infringement, malicious code, hate speech), are broad but could benefit from additional specificity to address issues commonly faced by the community when they don't \"trust\" a package. \n\n### Suggested Report Categories:\n\nTo further support transparency and trust within the ecosystem, consider adding additional categories like:\n- **Impersonation or misleading information** – For packages that mislead users about their origin or author.\n- **Dependency hijacking/typosquatting** – For packages mimicking trusted libraries to exploit users.\n- **License violations** – For misuse of open-source licenses.\n- **Abandonware/Outdated package** – For packages that have been abandoned by the maintainer and could pose trust or functionality issues.\n\n### Benefits\nBy expanding these categories and adopting a transparent DMCA reporting process, NuGet can better support users in maintaining trust within the ecosystem. The additional abuse categories would allow users to more accurately describe their concerns and help the platform address issues more effectively, enhancing overall package reliability and security.\n\nOne such thought is enough reports by the community for impersonation, hijacking, license violations, etc would have NuGet being able to take more proactive action while DMCA processes are figured out in parallel due to community concern and [NuGet's current ToS](https://www.nuget.org/policies/Terms).\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"43020718032","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-20T14:15:29","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10232","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Feature]: DMCA requests in a public OSS repository\" (#10232) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Related Problem\n\n_No response_\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\n## Feature Request: Implement Transparent DMCA Takedown Process for NuGet\n\nI recently discussed with Microsoft Legal the possibility of NuGet adopting a more open and transparent DMCA process, similar to GitHub's approach, where DMCA requests are posted with private information redacted (e.g., [GitHub's DMCA repository](https://github.com/github/dmca)).\n\nThis change would enhance transparency in the .NET OSS ecosystem by making existing complaints visible, helping developers track the history of DMCA actions against libraries. It could also serve as a valuable future data source for understanding trends and potential issues within the ecosystem.\n\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nThe team should feel free to start adopting a similar process and helping our community stay in the loop of what's going on regarding DMCA matters."},{"Id":"42991737570","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-18T17:26:28","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10231","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Use discard _ for fire and forget task\" (#10231) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Thanks for the recommendation, @jimmylewis!\r\n\r\nThis improves on top of https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10229 and is clean-up I found while working on https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10212."},{"Id":"42989455534","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-18T16:02:35","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10231","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Use discard _ for fire and forget task\" (#10231) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Thanks for the recommendation, @jimmylewis!\r\n\r\nThis improves on top of https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10229 and is clean-up I found while working on https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10212."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"43063902133","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-21T21:18:59","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13872","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGet.Versioning.NuGetVersion can incorrectly report `IsSemVer2 == true` when version includes build metadata\" (#13872) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nNuGet SDK\n\n### Product Version\n\nNuGet.Versioning 6.11.1\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

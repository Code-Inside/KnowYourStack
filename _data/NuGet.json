Ive noticed this behaviour affecting builds running in Bitbucket Pipelines (CICD service), and have reproduce similar issues directly on EC2. This happens when using Route53 as the DNS resolver (the default when starting up a new EC2 instance).\r\n\r\nIt appears that the problem is due to Alpine's inability to handle truncated DNS responses. If running `dig` to perform a DNS lookup for api.nuget.org , we notice the `tc` flag set in the response headers, indicating a truncated DNS response. The following was executed from an EC2 instance in us-east-1. We've found truncation does not occur in us-west-2.

Only the csproj is taken into account. This causes properties to be duplicated from the _Directory.Build.props_ file to the csproj.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1. Take a .nupkg file and name it the following: _Debug.Test.nupkg_.\r\n2. Place it in a local feed on the PC where Visual Studio can find it.\r\n3. Create a new C# project (i.e. a class library)\r\n4. Create a _Directory.Build.props_ file and place it next to the csproj file.\r\n5. Add the following to the _Directory.Build.props_ file:\r\n```\r\n<PropertyGroup Condition=\"$(Configuration.StartsWith('Debug'))\">\r\n\t<PureConfiguration>Debug</PureConfiguration>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n6. Reference the Debug.Test NuGet in the previous created project the following way: \r\n`<PackageReference Include=\"$(PureConfiguration).Test\" Version=\"<TheVersionOfThePackage>\" />`\r\n7. Clear nuget cache\r\n8. Run either `nuget restore NameOfTheProject.csproj` or `dotnet restore NameOfTheProject.csproj` from the command line (i.e. cmd.exe)\r\n\r\n**Expected**: PackageReference should get resolved as _Debug.Test_, because the `$(PureConfiguration)` property is defined in the _Directory.Build.props file_.\r\n\r\n**Result**: PackageReference is resolved as _.Test_, because the `$(PureConfiguration)` property was not found. Causes `dotnet restore` or `nuget restore` to fail to resolve the project.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: Duplicate the property from the _Directory.Build.props_ file into the csproj.\r\n\r\n### Further

(But my absolute preference would be to drop it, or only issue it as part of some new \"nuget analyze-config\" command.)\r\n\r\nIf there's actual potential for breakage when multiple potential sources apply to a package, then that should be clearly documented (and perhaps briefly explained in the warning as well). And then a situation where the nuget.config specifies overlapping mapping patterns should likely trigger NU1507 too. Ideally, there would also be some sort of description of how to handle some relatively common scenarios, like having one \"real\" nuget feed (say, nuget.org), plus one local folder source (to make it easy to do testing with locally-built test packages). In such a case, there may not always be a usable prefix pattern, so using \"*\" for both would be reasonable.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"20398585964","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T18:32:01","Actor":"clairernovotny","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/61","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Requiring two-factor authentication on NuGet.org\" (#61) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced plans to require tFA on all accounts on NuGet.org.

It would be nice if the references added by [ResolveNuGetPackageAssets](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.BuildTasks/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.NuGet.Build.Tasks/ResolveNuGetPackageAssets.cs#L311) annotated the reference as resolved by NuGet (maybe `ResolvedFrom=Package`?).\n\nCurrently, because this metadata isn't provided, they end up having `ResolvedFrom={RawFileName}`. \n\nThis would allow other tooling/targets to tell apart these references from others.

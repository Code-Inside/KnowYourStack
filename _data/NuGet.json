This doesn't seem to be normal.\n\n### Repro Steps\n\n1. I published the package, the first version for this package, with `dotnet nuget push` from [this GitHub Action](https://github.com/Lombiq/Helpful-Libraries/actions/runs/1715042166).\r\n2. The https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries page appeared within seconds, as expected.\r\n3. Initially the \"This package has not been indexed yet.\" message was displayed, as expected, however, this still is there. I'd expect the latest version(s) (the ones I've published since then) to gradually get indexed but this is for the first version:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1976647/150044061-83e84369-75b6-4569-913d-7c1a48d49df9.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe package is indexed after a couple of minutes, half an hour at most. If there are any temporary issues then I'd expect https://status.nuget.org/ to show it but it's all green:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1976647/150043880-99f27937-cfa8-434e-8871-468d11862f53.png)\r\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\nAdded above.\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"19802759552","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-01-19T00:55:40","Actor":"Piedone","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8944","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[NuGetGallery repository Bug]: \" (#8944) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

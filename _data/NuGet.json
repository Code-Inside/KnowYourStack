But the form it brings them down leaves actually putting them together into a usable directory as an out-of-scope problem.  If you're working on C# source-code, this is fine.  But if you're trying to handle an .exe that lives in a nuget package, or if you're trying to access a nuget package in Powershell or CSX script, you can't actually load it because its dependencies are outside of the module search path.\r\n\r\nSo, proposal, call it \"deploy\".  As in \r\n\r\n```\r\nnuget deploy mypackagename -OutputDirectory ./packages -DeployDirectory ./bin -Framework netcore\r\n./bin/myPackageName.ExeTool.exe -someParam Foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty straightforward use of Nuget.exe, and yet the amount of code it requires is very very non-trivial.  See the Tolstoy at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39257572/loading-assemblies-from-nuget-packages\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nDetailed example.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if I do this:\r\n\r\n```ps\r\nnuget install Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild -o ./packages\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get MsBuild and all its dependencies in `./packages`.  Which is great!  But if I try to use the copy of `SqlPackage.exe` that lives in there, I get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> .\\packages\\Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild.16.0.62004.28040\\lib\\net46\\SqlPackage.exe\r\n\r\nUnhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Data.Tools.Utilities, Version=15.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Tools.Schema.CommandLineTool.Program.Main(String[] args)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is sad.  I have the file, I have the dependencies, it's just I have to put them together myself.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir bin -Force\r\ncp packages/*/lib/net46/* bin -Force\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then try it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> .\\bin\\SqlPackage.exe | select-object -First 3 # we don't want the whole help doc\r\nSqlPackage: Command-line tool for creating and deploying SQL Server databases and DACPAC packages.\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it works if you're willing to deploy the files out of the packages folder yourself.  Nuget being able to help with this would be fantastic.\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe offers a similar service in `dotnet tool install` but it only allows things that are flagged as *tools*, and is very netcore oriented and so doesn't really work well with old framework things like nuget.exe does.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> dotnet tool install Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild --tool-path ./bin\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\zaratem\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\fc86e76c-4d47-498e-8a10-e120aaaa7ea3\\restore.csproj : error NU1212: Invalid project-package combination for Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild 16.0.62004.28040. DotnetToolReference project style\r\n can only contain references of the DotnetTool type\r\nThe tool package could not be restored.\r\nTool 'microsoft.data.tools.msbuild' failed to install.

At a minimum it should still list the other package that's outdated (AngleSharp.Css 0.16.0 -> 0.16.4) if step 3 was run. It would also be nice to have a warning [like the one on nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngleSharp/1.0.0-alpha-844) about the AngleSharp version being unlisted, with a mention of the highest published version.\r\n\r\nWhat I got:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe following sources were used:\r\n   https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\r\n\r\nerror: Sequence contains no matching element\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage: NuGet.CommandLine.XPlat.dll package list [arguments] [options]\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis made it more difficult to identify packages that needed I to update (note that `dotnet list repro package --outdated` also does not list AngleSharp) on a project with several dependencies.

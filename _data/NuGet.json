For example:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/10702007/9ecff1c0-3643-4604-9678-2117b169b9e2)\r\n\r\nThis is a lie, since I can navigate to the *.csproj file and clearly see the dependencies. But, I shouldn't have to dive into the source to determine which dependencies exist.\n\n### Repro Steps\n\n1. Navigate to https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-sqlcache\r\n2. Click the **Dependencies** tab and notice the message \"This package has no dependencies\"\r\n3. Navigate to [the source code](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/2b5d2b36a04f3a4a9bb20bbca38617d1cd6a3a1a/src/Tools/dotnet-sql-cache/src/dotnet-sql-cache.csproj#L17-L19) and notice the 3 dependencies listed\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe dependencies listed in the *.csproj file should be displayed on the **Dependencies** tab. In the case of dotnet-sqlcache, I'd expect to see these dependencies listed:\r\n- Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n- Azure.Identity\r\n- System.Private.Uri\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"39202687230","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-06-11T17:15:12","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9975","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Nuget.org styles] Mug shaped focus border on some images\" (#9975) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"There is a weird border focus on some of the images, it looks like a mug, most likely not intentional.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/43253759/b8d3acd3-8e2e-4e27-b93f-f82b12dd658a)\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/43253759/b3ad42b9-cd2f-4d49-9575-9c7401e023b0)\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"39214145978","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-06-12T02:29:04","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13539","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Update nuget.exe docs for new eula command\" (#13539) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"39209608868","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-06-11T21:49:43","Actor":"Nigusu-Allehu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13251","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`dotnet` commands should not output usage information on all errors\" (#13251) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n```console\r\n> dotnet nuget remove source ashjdfsbf\r\nerror: Unable to find any package source(s) matching name: ashjdfsbf.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage: dotnet nuget remove source [arguments] [options]\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n  name  Name of the source.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --configfile  The NuGet configuration file.

If done in a directory that does not contain any `*.*proj` file it outputs:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nCould not find any project in `D:\\src\\test\\`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it, no usage information. Whereas, if I add `--arg-that-does-not-exist`, then I get an error message saying the argument is not recognised, followed by the usage/help information.\r\n\r\nThis is a pattern that most CLI apps use.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nI believe that customers are getting confused by the extra verbosity in the error message, especially in the `dotnet add package` scenario where neither the first line nor the last line of the message output to customers is an error message. We have gotten github issues and VS feedback where the error message states what the problem is, but customers don't seem to notice and report the issue to us rather than fixing the issue themselves."},{"Id":"39208361643","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-06-11T20:50:24","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13467","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Document known issue in 6.10\" (#13467) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"See details in https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13466."},{"Id":"39208097013","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-06-11T20:39:12","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13293","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGetAudit should check transitive packages by default when the .NET 9 SDK is installed\" (#13293) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\nNuGet.exe, Visual Studio Package Management UI, Visual Studio Package Manager Console, MSBuild.exe, dotnet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nCurrently `NuGetAuditMode` defaults to `direct`, which means that NuGetAudit will only create warnings when direct package references have a known vulnerability.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\n`NuGetAuditMode` should default to `all`, so both direct and transitive package references should be scanned for known vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nNote this will create additional warnings, which were not present before.

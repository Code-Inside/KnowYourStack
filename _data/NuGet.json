When we copy .nupkg files from nuget.org to our feed, they are valid. However, for some reason, after some time we are starting to get errors like the following when we are restoring packages from our feed:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Nuget\\nuget.exe verify -All .\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.2.1.1.nupkg\r\n\r\nVerifying Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.2.1.1\r\n...\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.2.1.1.nupkg\r\n\r\nFinished with 1 errors and 0 warnings.\r\nNU3005: The package signature file entry is invalid. The central directory header field 'compression method' has an invalid value (8).\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt turns out that in a valid .nupkg file, the signature file is not compressed. And in an invalid package, the signature file is compressed using Deflate method.\r\n![valid-invalid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7262311/172415815-338320bc-5116-4e38-9c67-eaa5ae22b53f.png)\r\n\r\nBoth signatures, if extracted (unzipped) from the package, are binary equal (you can also see the same CRC on the screenshot). So the problem is that for some reason NuGet does not support signatures compressed with deflate method.\r\n\r\nWe don't realize yet how it is possible that our package feed \"repackages\" packages and compresses their signatures, but it seems that nuget.exe should support such signatures since they have a perfectly valid compression method in terms of ZIP file format.\r\n\r\nExample of a \"broken\" package:\r\n[Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.2.1.1.nupkg.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/8854398/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.2.1.1.nupkg.zip)\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1523796925275054081","CreatedAt":"2022-05-09T22:47:52+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Happy Monday friends.

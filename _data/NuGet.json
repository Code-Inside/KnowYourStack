I've followed all of the troubleshooting advice, I've got my tokens, my repository url set, my nuget.config file configured, but I find that both pushing/pulling packages is relatively intermittent. Sometimes it just works - other times I get the following error:\r\n\r\nPushing <packageName> to \"http://nuget.pkg.github.com/<Owner> PUT https://nuget.pkg.github.com/<Owner>/ An error encountered when fetching PUT http://nuget.pkg.github.com/<Owner>.

I'm presuming it's just a temperamental fault that will be rectified?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@bjorhn commented \r\n\r\n'm having the exact same problem as @JB101UK. I have two private repos set up, they're both designed to build and push packages to GitHub and they're set up with near-identical scripts. In one of the repos the push succeeds 100% of the time, and in the other repo it only succeeds about 20-25% of the time. All I have to do in order to make it work is run the same action over and over until it goes through. **I don't even have to create a new PR, I just keep clicking on the failed workflow -> \"Re-run jobs\" until it works**.\r\n\r\nMy failing action looks like this:\r\n```\r\nname: Release\r\n\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches:\r\n      - master\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    name: Build & Publish\r\n    runs-on: windows-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\r\n      - name: Setup .NET Core\r\n        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1\r\n        with:\r\n          dotnet-version: '3.1.201' # SDK Version to use.\r\n          source-url: https://nuget.pkg.github.com/bjorhn/index.json\r\n        env:\r\n          NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\r\n      - name: Restore Nuget packages\r\n        run: dotnet restore\r\n      - name: Create the nuget package\r\n        run: dotnet pack MyProject.csproj --configuration Release --no-build --output bin/Release/Publish\r\n      - name: Publish to GitHub\r\n        run: dotnet nuget push bin/Release/Publish/**/*.nupkg --skip-duplicate\r\n```\r\nThe only difference between the working and the failing repo/action is that the working one performs a dotnet build instead of a dotnet restore, and doesn't set the --no-build flag when calling dotnet pack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@bgilbert6 commented \r\n\r\nNo matter what I try I only ever get this reply:\r\n`\r\nwarn : No API Key was provided and no API Key could be found for 'https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ORG'.

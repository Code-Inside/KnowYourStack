However, if none of the package sources contain vulnerability information (for example, a package source that upstreams to nuget.org, but doesn't yet know about the brand new vulnerability info server resource), then the initial implementation of the feature will succeed without any warnings. This is indistinguishable from none of the packages having known vulnerabilities, and therefore gives a false sense of security.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, restore should raise a warning that no package sources provide vulnerability data.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"29605229167","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-07T22:40:43","Actor":"Erarndt","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12642","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"PackageSpec.Clone and LibraryDependency.Clone overwrite collections created by their constructors.\" (#12642) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Both `Clone` methods create a new default object that has collections that get implicitly assigned in the constructors.

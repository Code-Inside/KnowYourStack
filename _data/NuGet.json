This is not currently supported with either a tool available to users or to site admins.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new account with the desired username.\r\n2. Add the new account as an owner on packages the old account owns.\r\n3. Accept ownership in the new account and remove the old account from ownership.\r\n4.

We are adding null annotations, so projects using [nullable reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references) will benefit from compiler null checking, leading to improved software reliability (fewer NullReferenceExceptions).\r\n\r\nGenerally when annotating nulls we try to avoid making any breaking API or ABI changes. However, the following changes have been made in order to allow the compiler to provide everyone with the most useful nullable warnings.\r\n\r\nProjects that use this package and enable nullable checks might find that upgrading to a version of the package that now has nullable annotations will generate warnings that previously did not generate warnings. This is a natural consequence of annotating the assembly where it previously lacked annotations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following breaking changes were implemented:\r\n \r\n## Using the `required` modifier on some class properties\r\n\r\nThe following classes are affected: `Library`, `LibraryDependency`, `LibraryIdentity`, `LibraryRange`\r\n\r\n[C#11 introduced the `required` modifier](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/required). It means that projects creating instances of these type will be required to use the [object initializer syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers), and if any property marked as `required` is not assigned a value, the compiler will generate an error. We also provide constructors with all the required properties as constructor parameters. If you are not creating instances of these types, you should be unaffected, even if your project uses lower versions of the C# language.\r\n\r\nWhile my own testing was not exhaustive, it appears that projects targeting lower C# language versions will still provide correct required property compiler checks as long as the compiler supports C#11. Therefore, if your project builds with the latest .NET SDK or Visual Studio (including MSBuild for command line builds), you should be able to use either the object initializer syntax, or a suitable constructor.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're using an older version of Visual Studio, MSBuild, or the .NET SDK (for example, using a *global.json* file to pin to .NET 6 SDK), you will get a compiler error saying the constructor is obsolete when using the default constructor, or any other constructor that does not have a parameter for every required property. In this case, you should use a different constructor overload that the compiler does not consider obsolete.\r\n"},{"Id":"32187193641","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-09-28T22:40:43","Actor":"meokullu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12911","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Unexpected increase of Updates() when installing prelease packages.\" (#12911) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.7.0.127\n\n### Worked before?\n\nNo\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

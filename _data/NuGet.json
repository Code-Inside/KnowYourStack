To check the current installed version of the tool, use nuget help.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Debian **en_US.UTF-8** this produces the following version string output (trimmed to remove the help text):\r\n```\r\nNuGet Version: 6.3.1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, on Debian **de_DE.UTF-8** this produces the following:\r\n```\r\nNuGet Version: 6.3.1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, on a Korean locale Mac, the string version is translated:\r\n```\r\nNuGet 버전: 6.6.1.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEssentially, what I'd suggest is *not* translating the string _Version_ in any case. This would provide a consistant way to get the version string, but I'm also not entirely clear why it's not being translated in the German case, seeing as most of the other command-line output is.\r\nA 'better' solution to the problem would be something like the following:\r\n`nuget version` to return simply the version number, but I don't know why the original design choice was made.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"31267595083","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-08-21T20:20:48","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12822","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Visual Studio should show updates for `MSBuildSdk` package types\" (#12822) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nMSBuild projects may reference a SDK from NuGet.

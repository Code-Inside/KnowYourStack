An acceptable number would be 15 seconds tops. \r\n\r\nOur CI server (Teamcity) uses the following command : \r\n**dotnet restore -r debian.8-x64 SolutionFile.sln** . The last build took 2 min 40 s. It seems very long.\r\n\r\nAnother question that comes to mind is that on subsequent runs, the restore should be much faster because all the packages are already downloaded to our machines / our build server. Isn't there some sort of cache to prevent scanning all versions of each csproj ?\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe):\r\n**VS UI and dotnet.exe**\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx):\r\n**Package Manager Console Host Version 4.2.0.2457**\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe --version (if appropriate):\r\n**1.0.4**\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): \r\n**VS 2017 Community 15.2**\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)):\r\n**Win 10 v1703 15063.413**\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1.

See the slow performance of the nuget restore command\r\n\r\nAlternatively : Use **dotnet.exe restore file.sln --versbosity diag** and see that restoring nuget packages takes a very long time, each time it is run.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\nPlease include verbose logs (NuGet.exe <COMMAND> -verbosity detailed | dotnet.exe <COMMAND> --verbosity diag | etc...)\r\n\r\nI included the **dotnet.exe restore file.sln --versbosity diag** from the solution that is also included in the zip file.\r\n\r\n[logs.txt](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/1081122/logs.txt)\r\n\r\n### Sample Project\r\n\r\nI included a sample solution that is exactly the solution we use. \r\nIt won't compile, because I deleted all files from it, except the .csproj.

Without carefully reviewing logs, you can't even tell where a package came from after the fact. Combine this with an automated build pipeline and it's a recipe for disaster. Worse, if you need two feeds and they both happen to contain variations on the same package, you have zero control of where the build sources the package.\r\n\r\nWhere I work (very large enterprise, thousands of developers) we have many internal package sources dedicated to copies of public feeds, various in-house dev, testing, and release feeds, and so on. We also have _thousands_ of project-specific feeds. On occasion, some of us doing R&D work even activate truly-public feeds. VS in a typical developer environment will list 10-20 feeds. It is not unusual to have duplicate packages in multiple feeds -- or worse, someone has published a package for their own project that \"hides\" an official package by the same name.\r\n\r\nIt's enough of a hassle that I tend to just pull packages down by hand and reference a local-path feed, apart from extremely well-known dependencies like `Microsoft.*` packages.\r\n\r\n(This same scenario -- many package sources -- was also the driver for something I requested many years ago: the ability to control the search order of package sources. A fundamentally different request of course, but still badly needed. Figured it can't hurt to mention it again.)"},{"Id":"12909110265","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-15T08:37:57","Actor":"v-nancyj","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9798","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Test Failure][Signing] No warning is showed in Error List when installing a signed package with ‘Package config’ format in PM UI\" (#9798) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\n**NuGet Version:** Dev\\5.8.0.6721\r\n**VS Version:** Master\\30314.159\r\n**OS Version:** Windows-10-Enterprise-RS5\r\n\r\n## Installation steps: \r\n1.\tInstall VS: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=3891706&view=ms.vss-build-web.run-extensions-tab\r\n2.\tInstall NuGet Client: [\\\\\\ddfiles\\Drops\\NuGet\\Drops\\CI\\NuGet.Client\\Dev\\5.8.0.6721\\artifacts\\VS15\\NuGet.Tools.vsix](url)\r\n\r\n## Repro steps: \r\n1.

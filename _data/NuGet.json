This is a regression from 6.0.102.\r\n\r\nThe repro is consistent but requires a highly specific environment.\r\n\r\n~I've only been able to repro this in a Docker container, specifically a Windows Server version 20H2 container running on a Windows Server version 20H2 host machine. I cannot repro it with a different host version. For example, my Win 10 21H2 machine cannot repro it even though I'm targeting a 20H2 container.~ I've been able to repro this on a Windows Server version 20H2 and Windows Server 2022 host machine. Using 20H2 has produced the most consistent repro in our .NET Docker builds. It requires container process isolation, the default for Windows Server, which explains why it can't repro on my Win 10 21H2 machine because that can only use Hyper-V isolation (see [Windows container version compatibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility?tabs=windows-server-2022%2Cwindows-10-21H1)). ~This is very specific to 20H2 for some reason. The [dotnet/dotnet-docker](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker) repo has the same tests that are run for other supported Windows versions and they all work.~\r\n\r\nAlso, cleaning of the Docker images is necessary between repro attempts. It doesn't make sense to me but, for whatever reason, not cleaning images after a previous attempt will cause the next attempt to succeed.\r\n\r\nAs for the repro solution, it's a multi-project solution consisting of 3 projects: a root project that references 2 child projects. If I remove one of the child projects, the issue doesn't repro.\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Azure VM for Windows Server 20H2 that has container support enabled. I used `[smalldisk] Windows Server, version 20H2 with Containers` from the VM gallery which is Windows Server Core. I'm unsure if this would repro in a full Windows VM.\r\n2. Download and extract the repro solution:\r\n[complexapp.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/8099340/complexapp.zip). This project originally comes from https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/tree/main/samples/complexapp.\r\n3. `cd complexapp`\r\n4. Ensure that container images are cleaned up: `docker system prune -af`\r\n5. Build the Dockerfile: `docker build .`. It should fail on the `dotnet restore` step.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\nThe issue would not repro when using diagnostic verbosity (possibly timing related). But I was able to collect logs with detailed verbosity:\r\n[dotnet-restore.txt](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/8099371/dotnet-restore.txt)\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"21760625314","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-12T18:19:59","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11799","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"nuget integrity check DocumentFormat.OpenXml 2.16.0\" (#11799) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I am getting an integrity check on the DocumentFormat.OpenXml 2.16.0 package.

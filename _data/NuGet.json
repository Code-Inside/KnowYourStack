Open PM UI and prepare to perform a package installation. A package which requires license acceptance will make it easier to see the effect.\r\n2. Configure your project such that a restore error will occur.\r\n3. Perform the installation\r\n4. Observe a License Acceptance dialog appears.\r\n5. Accept the license\r\n6. Observe that Restore errors are shown.\r\n\r\nThe errors are shown during the execution of the restore here: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/f1757fe7a9a3e178562518f4535f71348a117010/src/NuGet.Clients/NuGet.PackageManagement.UI/Actions/UIActionEngine.cs#L471\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/assets/49205731/758539e1-8b6a-4a3a-99c6-820eb721d57c)\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"29944420112","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-22T18:07:59","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12689","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ContentItemCollection.FindBestItemGroup boxing enumerator\" (#12689) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1837339"},{"Id":"29925468933","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-22T04:57:15","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12681","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preview Window needs some strings reworded and margins adjusted\" (#12681) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\nN/A\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

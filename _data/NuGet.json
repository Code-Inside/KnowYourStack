This was observed in PR NuGet/NuGet.Client#3270 as the changes were not reflecting in the tests leading to tests passing locally and failing on CI and vice-versa.\r\n\r\n## Repro\r\n\r\n1. Make some drastic changes to NuGet Pack targets (like delete the entire content)\r\n\r\n2. Build and run tests.\r\n\r\n3. Observe that tests do run successfully as the changed target files are not copied into test layout.\r\n\r\n## Issue when implementing a Fix\r\n\r\nIt is straight forward to fix copying the pack assets to the test layout but the current implementation only copies `CoreCLR` assets for testing both the variants. There should be way to determine if the tests are running under Core MSBuild or Full MSBuild, so that we can efficiently test both type of project styles with the same tests. This is a blocker to enable tests on Full MSBuild (with non-sdk style projects) with the pack targets."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1313223356037070848","CreatedAt":"2020-10-05T21:03:41+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"The issue has been resolved!

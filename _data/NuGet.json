As a consequence, a single NoWarn can add minutes to a project restore, or cause the restore to fail with an `OutOfMemoryException`.\r\n\r\nIn the method for checking whether the NoWarns along one path are a superset of the NoWarns along another path (`NodeWarningProperties.IsSubSetOf`), `null` is considered to be the empty set.\r\n\r\nThe bug is this: in the method to get the intersection of the NoWarns (`NodeWarningProperties.GetIntersect`), `null` doesn't act like the empty set.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this issue, create n >= 30 projects - where `ClassLibrary{i}` has project references to `ClassLibary1`..`ClassLibrary{i-1}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, create three more projects: `Root`, `RootLeft`, and `RootRight` with the following project references:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRoot -> RootLeft -> ClassLibrary{n}\r\nRoot -> RootRight -> ClassLibrary{n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the following two package references to `RootLeft`:\r\n\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\" Version=\"6.0.0\">\r\n      <NoWarn>NU1000</NoWarn>\r\n    </PackageReference>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection\" Version=\"5.0.2\" />\r\n\r\n(Code to create all these projects can be found here: https://github.com/mjolka/LotsOfDependenciesIntersect)\r\n\r\nThe single nowarn in `RootLeft` causes the package restore to go from ~3 seconds to ~7 minutes when n = 30.\r\n\r\nWhen n = 35, the restore fails with an `OutOfMemoryException`.\r\n\r\nThe reason being, all `ClassLibrary{i}` projects are found first via a path that goes through `RootLeft`. This path contains a single NoWarn.\r\n\r\nWhen `ClassLibrary{i}` is later found via a path that goes through `RootRight`, these are no NoWarns along the path. The code to calculate the intersection of the NoWarns should result in the empty set. However, because of the bug, after taking the intersection, `seen[v]` still contains a single NoWarn, and the node will be processed again each time we find a new path to it.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to align the behaviour of `GetIntersect` to that of `IsSubSetOf` by treating `null` as the empty set. I'm able to contribute a pull request with this change.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"22404176138","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T21:26:14","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11893","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"GlobalJsonReader breaking change\" (#11893) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Now it looks from solutionpath property, which is breaking.

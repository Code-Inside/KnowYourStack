For .NET Framework the providers are discovered by searching credentialprovider*.exe and executing that program, and for .NET Core they are discovered by searching credentialprovider*.dll and executing ```dotnet <credentialprovider>.dll```. Prior to .NET Core 2.0 this split was required as .NET Core only supported platform agnostic dll's (with the side affect of excluding platform dependent credential providers not based on .NET). With the latest versions of .NET however, this split is no longer necessary and requires multiple versions to be supported and deployed. This is also reinforced by the two plugin path environment variables ```NUGET_NETFX_PLUGIN_PATHS``` and ```NUGET_NETCORE_PLUGIN_PATHS``` which need to be set per framework version.\r\n\r\nA deployment solution for dotnet is [.NET tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) which provide a seamless .NET install and management experience for NuGet packages. Using .NET tools as a deployment mechanism has been a recurring feature ask for users of the .NET ecosystem which need to authenticate with private repositories. The ideal workflow would be (for private repositories like Azure DevOps):\r\n1. Customers have dotnet CLI tools installed\r\n2. Run ```dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CredentialProviders```\r\n3. Run ```dotnet restore``` with a private endpoint and it 'just works' (e.g. credential providers from step 2 are used during credential acquisition and used to authenticate against private endpoints)\r\n\r\nThis almost works today, but for Windows .NET Framework only. The goal is to support this cross-platform for all supported .NET runtimes.\r\n\r\n## Problems\r\nThis work for Windows and .NET Framework today with the following caveats:\r\n1. You must use the \"tool path\" option when installing to get the tool in a path known by NuGet. By default .NET tools are installed to %USERPROFILE%\\\\.dotnet\\\\tools which is a location not examined by NuGet today. This can be specified explicitly, but can be error prone and doesn't take into account any environment customization:\r\n    ```\r\n    dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CredentialProviders --tool-path %USERPROFILE%\\.nuget\\plugins\\netfx\\CredentialProvider.Microsoft\r\n    ```\r\n2. .NET tools will wrap up the .NET application and layout with a single *.exe and hide all the details of the NuGet package and associated files in a .store directory as an implementation detail. This works for .NET Framework which exclusively checks for *.exe, but not for .NET Core.\r\n\r\nDeployment via a .NET tool doesn't work for .NET Core or cross platform for the following reasons:\r\n1. For Windows .NET tools will always use a *.exe extension. This doesn't work for .NET Core as that requires a *.dll to be invoked from dotnet, even if the .NET tool exe would otherwise work for both versions.\r\n2. For Linux/OSX the executable will not have any extension, but instead just have an executable with the execute bit (+x) set on it. E.g.:\r\n    ```\r\n    ~$ dotnet tool install -g my-dotnet-tool\r\n    You can invoke the tool using the following command: my-dotnet-tool\r\n    Tool 'my-dotnet-tool' (version '0.0.1') was successfully installed.\r\n\r\n    ~$ ls -l -a ~/.dotnet/tools\r\n    total 120\r\n    drwxrwxrwx  3 user user   4096 Mar 25  2019 .\r\n    drwxrwxrwx 13 user user   4096 Mar 30 17:34 ..\r\n    drwxrwxrwx  4 user user   4096 Mar 25  2019 .store\r\n    -rwxr-xr-x  1 user user 106744 Mar 25  2019 my-dotnet-tool\r\n    ```\r\nThis doesn't work as NuGet is exclusively looking for *.exe or *.dll\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nThe following changes in behavior would be required to make the proposal work:\r\n\r\n## 1. Support platform appropriate executables\r\nFor Windows: support *.exe for both .NET Framework and .NET Core.\r\nFor Linux/OSX: support extensionless executables (+x bit set).\r\n\r\n## 2. Support single plugin path environment variable\r\nIn order to ship a single credential provider that works for both .NET Framework and .NET Core that doesn't conflict with the existing semantics of the ```NUGET_NETFX_PLUGIN_PATHS``` and ```NUGET_NETCORE_PLUGIN_PATHS``` environment variables, a new environment variable should be introduced that supports the new semantics for # 1 above. It's possible that ```NUGET_PLUGIN_PATHS``` can be repurposed here, but that currently has lower precedence that the framework versions.\r\n\r\n## 3. Support the .NET tool default installation location for credential providers\r\nThe default .NET tool installation directory should be included when discovering credential providers. This will simplify the installation and should reduce cases where tools are installed to a location that NuGet does not consider, reducing troubleshooting and support cases.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThe overall context and vision for the credential providers that support Azure DevOps (nuget, npm, python, etc.) is that they should be supported and easily installable in the ecosystems they are used in. For .NET using the dotnet CLI that means installable using dotnet tool install, for npm that means npm install, etc. Currently, various installation scripts are required, per platform, which already assume a set of tools and configuration about the users environment (PowerShell/pwsh, bash/sh, etc.)."},{"Id":"28717683645","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-27T23:05:54","Actor":"borrrden","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12566","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Have a snupkg pack mode that is Nuget.org compliant\" (#12566) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\nNuGet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen running nuget pack on a package that has non-portable pdb inside, nuget.exe happily packs them knowing that they will later fail validation on nuget.org.

A snupkg can be reuploaded but this is meaningless since regenerating the pdb means that the new snupkg will fail to upload since it doesn't understand that it belongs to the existing pdb.  Furthermore, our internal nuget server has no issue hosting any kind of pdb and serving it via symbol server so it never occurred to me that this would even be an issue.  \n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nThe client should by default warn if any non-portable pdb files are found and NOT copy them to the snupkg to ensure that they are able to be uploaded to nuget.org.  Perhaps optionally provide a command line switch to copy them anyway.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"28712008521","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-27T17:45:44","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12550","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Reduce allocations in VirtualFileInfo.Name\" (#12550) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"`VisualFileInfo` is an implementation of `IFileInfo` used with `Microsoft.Extensions.FileSystemGlobbing`.

One example I have experience in a corporate environment is that you have artifactory x-ray returning 404 Not Found for an insecure dependency. In this instance you have three options:\r\n\r\n- Whitelist the insecure dependency\r\n  - Undesirable for obvious reasons\r\n- Make the transitive dependency an direct dependency\r\n  -  Not desirable as if your direct dependency stops referencing this, you end up with an dependency you don't require\r\n- Add a package.lock.json and update in place\r\n  - This is a hassle because you need to install it as a direct dependency to get the correct hash, and then update the JSON to update the existing transitive dependency\r\n\r\nI would propose something similar to the [npm overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides) behaviour to  allow an explicit  requiriement that a direct/ransitive dependency must match a particular version range overriding the behaviour of the overall nuget dependency resolution approach which is unsuited to this situation, with all possible resolutions having disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThis could be added as an XML reference in the csproj and could be manually added by capable users as it is a more advanced use case.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"27557007112","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-07T18:44:23","Actor":"dnfadmin","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/68","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Moving to the new .NET Foundation CLA service\" (#68) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hello everyone\r\nThe .NET Foundation is transitioning to a new CLA service and I'm posting here to let you know it's happening.

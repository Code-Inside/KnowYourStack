We did plenty of troubleshooting and found that we can only resolve this URL when we use Azure's DNS servers (example: 168.63.129.16). Any other DNS servers like Google or Level 3 do not resolve when inside Azure. However when we test on our local workstations or servers (outside of Azure) they work perfectly fine. We aren't doing anything fancy in Azure, we're running IaaS, so we are essentially using Azure for hosting our servers only. All the obvious troubleshooting has been complete i.e. firewall testing/disabling, NSG firewall rules in Azure are good, DNS, rebooting, etc etc.\r\n\r\nThe problem first started when we tried to add a Microsoft.Azure package to a .NET project in Visual Studio 2022.

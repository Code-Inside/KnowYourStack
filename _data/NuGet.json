https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4855\r\n\r\nWe had multiple internal teams at MSFT who are doing a migration to Mariner reach out to us when moving from Mono's `nuget`(which is just the nuget.exe CLI) to the `dotnet` CLI and one common pain point was the missing support for the `install` command.\r\n\r\nMost of these teams are not even using .NET but have some tool which is hosted on an internal AzDO feed and they were using `nuget install <tool>` e.g. from CMake to grab the assets. Right now you need to create a dummy .csproj like this so you can run `dotnet restore` on it which makes this a lot more complicated:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n   <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n   <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>\r\n   <RestorePackagesPath>packages</RestorePackagesPath>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <PackageDownload Include=\"Some.Internal.Tool\" Version=\"[7.0.7]\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if we could get `dotnet nuget install` supported in the future 😄 \n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"28056668502","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T09:49:24","Actor":"andres395","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/12512","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Rename SECURITY.md to SECURITY.xml\" (#12512) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"28056615658","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T09:47:25","Actor":"andres395","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12511","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Así \" (#12511) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nNuGet SDK\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nBueno \n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nJajaja "},{"Id":"28054516210","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T08:30:13","Actor":"v-luzh","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12510","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Cross-platform Dotnet NuGet Sign] The error info of NU3018 on MacOS “the key usage is incorrect” is not clear enough when the certificate is not valid for code signing\" (#12510) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n .NET SDK 7.0.202\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

[Patched dotnet SDK](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/NuGet/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b8a3c6685-1661-47f4-8807-b765ca62aea1%7d&action=edit&wd=target%28Package%20Signing%20Manual%20Test.one%7C0344a15b-01b1-4828-af4c-63fe53687f8a%2FPatch%20dotnet%20SDK%7Cfd0e3c41-e7a8-4de8-b83a-1a09fdb56271%2F%29&wdorigin=703).\r\n2. On Windows: Create a new test certificate:    ` .\\CreateTestCertificate.ps1 -AddAsTrustedRootAuthority -Type SSLServerAuthentication -Password password -GenerateCerFile`  (in the powershell \"Developer Command Prompt\"). \r\n   On macOS: Copy the .cer file(should be generated under the same path with .pfx file) and the .pfx file from the above Windows machine to macOS machine.\r\n3. Go to the patchedSDK path and run the command as below. Where <CertificateFilePath> is the file path to the created certificate (in step1) .cer or .pem file and <VersionedSdkDirectoryPath> is the directory path for the patched versioned .NET SDK directory (e.g.:  ./patchedSDK/sdk/7.0.100), add trust for the certificate: \r\nOn macOS:  `./dotnet run --project ./Entropy/TrustTestCert/TrustTestCert.csproj --framework net7.0 -- add -c <CertificateFilePath> -vsd <VersionedSdkDirectoryPath> `\r\n4. Use the patched \"dotnet.exe\" to sign a package. Where <PackageFilePath> is the test package path and <PfxFilePath> is the file path to the .pfx file, sign the test package: \r\nOn macOS:  `./dotnet nuget sign <PackageFilePath> --overwrite --certificate-path <PfxFilePath> --certificate-password password --timestamper http://timestamp.digicert.com/ -v n `\r\n5. Verify the output of previous step.\r\n\r\n#### Expected:\r\nThere are two errors as below.\r\nError: NU3018: NotValidForUsage: The certificate has invalid policy.  \r\nError: NU3018: Certificate chain validation failed. \r\n\r\n#### Actual:\r\nThe error info of NU3018 on MacOS “the key usage is incorrect” is not clear enough as below screenshot.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20632625/228473504-5e2d0fb4-482d-4c4c-9a0f-228534206ae7.png)\r\n#### Note:\r\n1.It is not a regression.\r\n2.It doesn’t repro on Windows/Linux.\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"28041083321","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-28T18:34:06","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12473","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add central package management option for package management\" (#12473) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5714438/223906721-f366e960-d57e-4f2b-a5a0-a3c50fd6b64b.png)\r\n\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"28040882080","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-28T18:24:50","Actor":"jsteinich","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12509","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Allow resolving cousin dependency conflicts at a higher level\" (#12509) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nGiven the following dependencies:\r\n\r\n- My Project -> Package A -> Package B -> Package C (>=3.7 && < 3.8)\r\n- My Project -> Package D (>= 3.3) -> Package C (>= 3.3 && < 3.4)\r\n- Package D (3.7) -> Package C (>= 3.7 && < 3.8)\r\n\r\nattempting to resolve `My Project` will result in a version conflict for `Package C`.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nAllow `My Project` to resolve a newer version of `Package D` which does meet the constraints required by `Package B`.\r\nThis would not violate any of the constraints while still choosing the lowest version of dependencies.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nIt's possible to workaround this by directly referencing `Package C` in `My Project`; however, that is both an extra step and additional contextual understanding needed when simply trying to upgrade direct dependencies."},{"Id":"28039452474","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-28T17:20:59","Actor":"chipplyman","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12508","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Nuget does not report xml parse failures when evaluating the project file and its imports\" (#12508) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nMSBuild.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nmsbuild 17.2.1\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nCreate Directory.Build.props containing\r\n`<Project>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>net48</TargetFrameworks>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>`\r\n\r\nRemove any mention of TargetFramework from the csproj.\r\n\r\nBuild with `msbuild -restore`.

This change allows our team flexibility to switch to a back-up provider in the case that one CDN is down, which will broaden coverage for our users.\r\n\r\nSome changes are coming for older TLS cipher suites, which may result in connectivity issues. From our data we believe this will affect only a small percentage of requests. We will be monitoring all feedback channels during the migration to assess impact and adjust our roll-out timeline as needed.\r\n\r\nBelow, we provide resources to determine whether you will be affected by this change. This utilizes the [.NET CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to install a package from our pre-production (INT) environment which tests connectivity:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir cdn-test\r\ncd cdn-test\r\ndotnet new classlib\r\ndotnet add package BaseTestPackage.NetStandard --source https://apiint.nugettest.org/v3/index.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing connectivity issues while connecting to nuget.org or restoring packages from https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json, such as:\r\n\r\n\"The SSL connection could not be established\"\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that TLS 1.2 and any of the following cipher suites have been enabled on your machine:\r\n\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, do reach out to us at support@nuget.org or by commenting on the discussion issue: NuGet/Home#11058"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1631370937248481281","CreatedAt":"2023-03-02T19:08:35+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Your package's README is your chance to showcase your hard work and make a great first impression.

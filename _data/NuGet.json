If I want to see classes, methods etc. I need to open source code \r\nand look in the C# code about implemented feature. This is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nI created DNDocs to host API Explorer exactly for this problem:\r\nhttps://dndocs.com/i/nuget/AutoMapper/13.0.1\r\nhttps://dndocs.com/i/nuget/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/8.0.3\r\n\r\n### Long description\r\nDNDocs is a simple API Explorer (documentation hosting platform).\r\nDNDocs allows to generate and host API Docs online using [Docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).\r\nAfter generating a project, server do not delete it - generated docs are stored on the server disk\r\n(cached) and available immediately after generation. So generating occurs only once\r\nand can took 1-5 minutes and then Docs are  accessible immediately.\r\n\r\nTo Explore nuget package replace values in URL and open the page:\r\n`https://dndocs.com/i/nuget/{NugetPackageName}/{NugetPackageVersion}`\r\nWait 1-5 minutes (if server generate is for the first time) and just click green button\r\non the right.\r\n\r\n### Additional informations\r\nFor example, people want to have API Explorer and I think DocFX can fit well here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/6946\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9776\r\n\r\nAnd also some people on github hosts docs on DNDocs:\r\nhttps://github.com/madelson/DistributedLock\r\nhttps://github.com/betalgo/openai\r\nhttps://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nSo thats all what I want to say in this request.\r\nI would like to hear Your opinion about this feature and DNDocs project.\r\nDo You like it or not?

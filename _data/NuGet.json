For example,\r\n- Given a project A with `GeneratePackageOnBuild`, `a.nupkg` will be generated in the output folder of A\r\n- Given a project B with a `ProjectReference` to A, `a.nupkg` will _also_ be generated in the output folder of B\r\n\r\nThis seems like a bug (though maybe it's by design?). It's particularly problematic in CI scenarios where you want to build all projects and then crawl for packages to push. Because of this behavior, all your test project outputs will have the packages of the projects they're testing. Likewise, you'll end up with multiple copies of packages if any projects reference other projects.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the behavior should be to generate and output a package only for the project that contains `GeneratePackageOnBuild`.

I think I registered it originally with \"@grantb.net\", and then when it was absorbed by the MSA system, my account was merged with a \"@connamara.com\" MSA account.

I am creating a game engine in **C**# that uses **SDL**.  There is a popular **C**# wrapper library that **P/Invokes** into \r\nthe native **SDL2** libraries for the purpose of creating games.  These native libraries have **x86** and **x64** architecture versions of them and \r\nI need to to take advantage of both which means my game engine has only **x86** and **x64** architectures.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do is create a nuget package that contains multiple architectures of not only the native libraries but of my **C**# game\r\nengine library as well.  I have already learned that I can get the native libraries properly put into the package using the **csproj** file\r\nXML content that is similar to the what you see below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Target Name=\"Add-x64-SDL-Libs\" Condition=\"$(ConfigurationName) == 'Debug'\" AfterTargets=\"Build\">\r\n\t<ItemGroup>\r\n\t\t<Content Include=\"$(ProjectDir)SDL\\x86\\SDL-x86.dll\" Pack=\"true\" PackagePath=\"\\runtimes\\win10-86\\native\" />\r\n\t\t<Content Include=\"$(ProjectDir)SDL\\x64\\SDL-x64.dll\" Pack=\"true\" PackagePath=\"\\runtimes\\win10-64\\native\" />\r\n\t</ItemGroup>\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will of course put both the **x86** and **x64** version of the SDL libraries into the package.\r\n\r\nThe issue I am having is how do I get both architecture versions of my library into the package as well?  My thinking is that the consumer of the package\r\ncould use my package and either choose **x86** or **x64** and **Visual Studio** would just use the proper architecture for the libraries based on the architecture of their project. Is this even feasible?\r\n\r\nI thought that maybe I could do 2 separate packages.  One for **x86** and one for **x64**, but that does not seem like the right way to do it and I know there are packages out there that have it all in one. One good example is the **[System.Data.SQLite.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite.Core/#show-github-usage)** nuget package which supports many different platforms and architectures.\r\n\r\nI dug into the package and seen that they make use of a build directory which I know are additional instructions for **MSBuild** to use during the build process.  I tried finding documentation on this but I cannot find barely any information on the **microsoft docs** site or anywhere else on the format and use of the **.targets** files.\r\n\r\nI also do not want to take a path that will eventually be getting deprecated or that is not the recommended way of doing it.  An example of this is using **.nuspec** files.  I read that using them is not the preferred way of doing this anymore and that it is only used inside of the package, not part of your project.\r\n\r\nAgain my end goal is to just simply release multiple architectures of my native AND managed libraries in one package and anybody could just consume it, point to the right architecture and then it works.\r\n\r\nI have been struggling with this issue for about 2 weeks and even though I have learned a lot, I am coming up to a dead end. Any help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**NuGet Product Used:** VS UI\r\n\r\n**VS Version:** 16.4.5\r\n\r\n**OS Version:** win10 - v1709.16299.1625"},{"Id":"12621614621","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-13T13:25:20","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8941","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Warning NU5127 msbuild\" (#8941) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I'm upgrading some project to 3.1 and I get a warning from nuget pack command \r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\Sdks\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack\\build\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets(198,5): warning NU5127: This package does not contain a lib/ or ref/ folder, and will therefore be treated as compatible for all frameworks.

By skipping these projects during no-op restore evaluation, no-op restore becomes faster relative to how many .NET SDK-style projects are skipped; so, a solution with no .NET SDK-style projects will realize no benefit while a solution with only .NET SDK-style projects will realize maximum benefit.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I [tested a prototype](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8906) on the [NuGet.Client solution](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/tree/fcdcfb4c87265e14f5808ee6db03b54d5a5391cc), which at the time had 83 projects (74 .NET SDK-style projects and 9 legacy PackageReference projects).  With the solution loaded in Visual Studio and the solution fully restored and built once already, building the up-to-date solution involved a ~2.6 no-op restore.  By skipping .NET SDK-style projects during no-op restore evaluation, the no-op restore dropped to ~0.6 seconds.  GC heap allocations dropped from ~380 MB to ~88 MB.  Total GC pauses dropped by ~1 second.\r\n\r\nFor this optimization we need to ensure:\r\n*  .NET SDK-style projects are only skipped when we know the projects are already up-to-date.  If a nomination and no-op restore evaluation occur closely together; the no-op restore evaluation should block or be blocked on completion of all nominations or fallback to a real restore.\r\n*  .NET SDK-style projects must not be skipped during clean builds (or rebuilds) or explicit restore requests, only the no-op restores that occur implicitly during many larger user scenarios (e.g.:  build, debug, static code analysis, etc.).\r\n\r\nCC @aortiz-msft, @anangaur "},{"Id":"12617891495","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T19:52:23","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9633","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Thousands of NuGet.Versioning.NuGetVersion items are created\" (#9633) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I noticed this item is multiplying by thousands during memory leak investigation for another [item](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9595).\nLooks like it's under our Nuget.Client domain.\n![image.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/5eb1d84a3cd56675c3efe510/dbb96fdb-3673-4e14-b9ec-41c32db0e882)\nI think we need to investigate it.

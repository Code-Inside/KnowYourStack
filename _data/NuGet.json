Given the complexity, I'm not 100% sure how to reproduce it, but the outcome is that in Visual Studio, project-system was sending NuGet a nomination where the project had two ProjectReferences to the same project. One had path `..\\some\\reference.csproj`, whereas the other had path `d:\\path\\to\\some\\reference.csproj`. I guess this is why project-system failed to de-duplicate before sending to NuGet.\r\n\r\nIf the Directory.Build.props (or in this case some organization mandated SDK/build system) uses `<RestoreLockedMode>true`, then VS will fail with [NU1004](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu1004). The error message is super difficult to understand/determine what the difference is, but if you spend enough time, you can figure out that some of project references are duplicated. Figuring out why the project references are duplicated is even more difficult, and maybe is not possible by customers, even with a binlog. I had to debug NuGet's VS extension to figure it out.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"20591212491","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-04T22:59:55","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11652","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"IVsNuGetProjectUpdateEvents.StartSolutionRestore should emit file paths, not file name.\" (#11652) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"20590306568","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-04T21:31:06","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11651","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Disable NuGet.Protocol.Tests.LocalPackageSearchResourceTests.LocalPackageSearch_SearchAsync_SlowLocalRepository_WithCancellationToken_ThrowsAsync since it's flaky. \" (#11651) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Details in https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11650"},{"Id":"20590266470","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-04T21:27:33","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11650","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet.Protocol.Tests.LocalPackageSearchResourceTests.LocalPackageSearch_SearchAsync_SlowLocalRepository_WithCancellationToken_ThrowsAsync is flaky\" (#11650) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"6/46 builds have this failure.\r\n\r\nThis was a recently added test, so don't think it's a one off."},{"Id":"20589375322","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-04T20:14:07","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11649","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Warn when duplicate MSBuild items are detected\" (#11649) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Design for https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9864"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"20398585964","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T18:32:01","Actor":"clairernovotny","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/61","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Requiring two-factor authentication on NuGet.org\" (#61) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced plans to require tFA on all accounts on NuGet.org.

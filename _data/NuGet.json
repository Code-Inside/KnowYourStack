For example, the query plan of sniffed from Newtonsoft.Json looks totally different from BaseTestPackage and the performance when the query plans get mixed up is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nFor example, using a BaseTestPackage parameter value for the Newtonsoft.Json query plan results in a query that takes longer than 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nSome options:\r\n\r\n1. Use `OPTION ( OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN )` - this will cause very depended upon packages like Newtonsoft.Json to take 1-3 seconds per query. Maybe this okay with caching.\r\n1. Use `OPTION ( RECOMPILE )` and allow every parameter value and query execution to evaluate its own query plan.\r\n1.

I published the package, the first version for this package, with `dotnet nuget push` from [this GitHub Action](https://github.com/Lombiq/Helpful-Libraries/actions/runs/1715042166).\r\n2. The https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries page appeared within seconds, as expected.\r\n3. Initially the \"This package has not been indexed yet.\" message was displayed, as expected, however, this still is there. I'd expect the latest version(s) (the ones I've published since then) to gradually get indexed but this is for the first version:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1976647/150044061-83e84369-75b6-4569-913d-7c1a48d49df9.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe package is indexed after a couple of minutes, half an hour at most.

The Group/Tab is created upon installation of NuGet package, but it is empty (no items).\r\n\r\nIf we, instead of installing the NuGet package, copy the project containing the WPF User Controls into the solution and add a reference to it (Project -> Add -> Reference… -> Projects -> Check the checkbox for the project containing the WPF User Controls). The group AND the items appear. However, this functionality is exactly what we want when installing the NuGet package, and what we believed the VisualStudioToolsManifest.xml would help us with.\r\n\r\nAlso, if we go to the Toolbox, right click -> Choose Items -> Browse -> Navigate to the .dll that is installed with the NuGet package -> OK, the items are added to the Toolbox. Which should mean that there is nothing wrong with the .dll itself.\r\n\r\nThe NuGet package works in all other senses when installing (the custom controllers are shown in the XAML Designer view and the app compiles/runs with the custom controllers as expected).\r\n\r\nThe VisualStudioToolsManifest.xml looks like:\r\n```\r\n<FileList>\r\n  <File Reference = \"NameOfDLLFile.dll\">\r\n    <ContainsControls>True</ContainsControls>\r\n    <ToolboxItems UIFramework=\"WPF\" VSCategory=\"GenericGroup\" BlendCategory=\"GenericGroup\">\r\n      <Item Type=\"Namespace.Namespace.NameOfControl\" />\r\n      <!—More Items-->\r\n    </ToolboxItems>\r\n  </File>\r\n</FileList>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To summarize:** The “GenericGroup” is created as a group/tab in the Toolbox, but it is empty.\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Professional 2017 \r\nVersion 15.6.6\r\nVisualStudio.15.Release/15.6.6+27428.2037\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework\r\nVersion 4.8.03752\r\nInstalled Version: Professional\r\n\r\nVisual C++ 2017   00370-10003-57093-AA542\r\nApplication Insights Tools for Visual Studio Package   8.11.10402.2\r\nC# Tools   2.7.0-beta3-62715-05.

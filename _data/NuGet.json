That list today is `.dll; .exe; .winmd; .json; .pri; .xml; .mdb; .pdb`. This list works great for managed libraries!\r\n\r\nHowever, when packaging native dependencies in a package by default NuGet only allows native dependencies for the windows platforms. `.so` and `.dylib` assets for these other platforms are filtered out by the configuration above.\r\n\r\nI propose that NuGet add these two extensions to the allow list so that packaging native assets is easier and less confusing for users.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nI ran across this when helping @JanProvaznik package his [MSBuildWasm](https://github.com/JanProvaznik/MSBuildWasm/pull/19) project as a NuGet package containing MSBuild logic. Since his MSBuild logic needed both managed dependencies and native dependencies for all platforms, but we didn't want to package to `lib/` to prevent consumers from getting any of these libraries as runtime assets, we had to direct NuGet to package these dependencies to the `task/` subfolder. However, after adding Native dependencies to the `BuildOutputInPackage` ItemGroup, I found the non-dll native assets scrubbed out."},{"Id":"40684053332","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-08-02T05:41:25","Actor":"athinboy","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13669","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Is There any way to list the dependency tree of some dotnet project/solution ?\" (#13669) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI, Visual Studio Package Manager Console, NuGet SDK\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nwhen build a project ,there are some unexpected  **.dll files .

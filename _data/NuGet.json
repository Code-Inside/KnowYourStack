For example, within a Cake build, a user can reference the [Polly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly/) NuGet package, and leverage all of its features, defining and executing different Polly policies.\r\n\r\nNuGet packages can be used in Cake in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n- As a regular NuGet package (Package Reference, packages.config, NuGet Package Manager UI, etc.) on a [Console application](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting).\r\n\r\n- As a **[Cake Addin](https://cakebuild.net/docs/extending/addins/)** (`#addin`). In short, this means: Download the NuGet package, and load the assemblies within it into the host process executing the build process. Virtually any NuGet package containing .NET assembly(ies) can be loaded as a Cake Addin. e.g. `#addin nuget:?package=Polly&version=7.2.1`\r\n\r\n- As a **[Cake Tool](https://cakebuild.net/docs/writing-builds/tools/installing-tools)** (`#tool`). In short, this means: Download the NuGet package, and extract its contents to a folder, so that its files become available to the build process. Virtually any NuGet package can be loaded as a Cake Tool. e.g. `#tool nuget:?package=7-Zip.CommandLine&version=18.1.0`\r\n\r\n- As a **[Cake Module](https://cakebuild.net/docs/extending/modules/)** (`#module`). In short, this is very similar to Cake Addin, with the exception that modules are loaded earlier in the lifecycle and can replace and/or add Cake features that can be leveraged by the build process later. e.g. `#module nuget:?package=Cake.Npm.Module&version=0.1.0`\r\n\r\n- As a **[Cake Recipe](https://cakebuild.net/docs/writing-builds/reusing-builds#recipe-nuget-packages)** (`#load`). In short, this means: Download a NuGet package containing Cake scripts, and merge these scripts into the current build, allowing for sharing of reusable snippets of code.  e.g. `#load nuget:?package=Cake.Recipe&version=2.1.0`\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nWe'd like to display installation instructions on how to use NuGet packages with Cake, in the NuGet Gallery, on a new tab with the title \"Cake Build\", which would display a tailored set of instructions if a package is detected as being built specifically for use with Cake ([Cake Extension](https://cakebuild.net/docs/extending/)) or generic instructions otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe criteria we'd like to use for detecting if a package as built specifically for use with Cake would be the presence of specific `tags` in the package metadata:\r\n\r\n### Cake Addin\r\n\r\n- If a package contains the tag `cake-addin`, we assume its author meant for this package to be consumed as a Cake Addin. As such we would show a tailored instruction to install as a Cake Addin:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177608/104796691-f60dbc80-578e-11eb-8f43-ba4f294f80d9.png)\r\n\r\n### Cake Module\r\n\r\n- If a package contains the tag `cake-module`, we assume its author meant for this package to be consumed as a Cake Module . As such we would show a tailored instruction to install as a Cake Module:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177608/104796701-10e03100-578f-11eb-9591-f1ea1a7d1ba3.png)\r\n\r\n### Cake Recipe\r\n\r\n- If a package contains the tag `cake-recipe`, we assume its author meant for this package to be consumed as a Cake Recipe.  As such we would show a tailored instruction to install as a Cake Recipe:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177608/104796718-379e6780-578f-11eb-9bc4-da73cc7ebdfc.png)\r\n\r\n### Other packages\r\n\r\n- If a package does not contain any of the known `cake-` tags, we'd display generic instructions for the user to consume the package either as a Cake Addin or as a Cake Tool, and leave it to the user to choose what is more appropriate for their scenario.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177608/104796752-7b916c80-578f-11eb-93e9-4317e8f28f70.png)\r\n\r\n## 3rd-Party NuGet client listing criteria\r\n\r\nWe believe Cake meets all the criteria for being listed as a 3rd-party client on nuget.org:\r\n\r\n- :white_check_mark: **Significant adoption in .NET community**: Cake is widely used by thousands of [open-source projects](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xNTY3NDU3NzY%3D), is the [third most downloaded .NET tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages?packagetype=dotnettool&sortby=relevance&q=&prerel=True) at the moment with over 4 (four) million downloads\r\n- :white_check_mark: **Cake is actively maintained and updated**: Cake published over `110` releases since 2014 (with `10` releases in 2020), has a [healthy community of contributors](https://cakebuild.net/community/thanks/), and is a [member of the .NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/cake)\r\n- :white_check_mark: **Security compliance**: Cake is compliant with the latest security requirements as implemented by NuGet.org\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n[Members of the Cake team](https://cakebuild.net/docs/team/) would send one or more pull-requests to implement the final design that ends up being agreed, based on the above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n/cc @joelverhagen @anangaur, @jcjiang\r\n"},{"Id":"14876009397","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-01-19T23:57:16","Actor":"ryuyu","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8380","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[Stats]Enable Alternate storage for downloads.v1.json\" (#8380) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Enables (behind a feature flag) support for allowing an alternate location for downloads.v1.json source."},{"Id":"14863582885","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-01-19T05:10:38","Actor":"drewgillies","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8379","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Determine delta re WhiteSource vs GitHub vulnerabilities, ascertain priority of including WhiteSource\" (#8379) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"We don't see https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1469 in GitHub.

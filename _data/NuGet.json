We tried to raise awareness in:\r\n\r\n* VS Whats New window\r\n* VS release notes\r\n* .NET 9 release notes\r\n* NuGet release notes\r\n* NuGetAudit 2.0 blog post\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a sufficiently large number of customers didn't find/read any of these and were unable to resolve the problem without either reporting it as a bug or rolling back to the previous version. Therefore, management has decided that business continuity is more important than warning customers that their project is using packages with known vulnerabilities, and we're reverting this change.\r\n\r\nMost of the concern is around \"false positives\" (System.* packages whose contents are not actually used because the framework's targeting pack provides assemblies with a higher version).  The consequence is that packages that pose a real security threat will no longer be warned about by default."},{"Id":"44030262644","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-11-20T20:05:10","Actor":"oztarc","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13885","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NU3003 - NU1605 - NU1701\" (#13885) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\n.NET runtimes installed:   Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.35 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]   Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]   Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0-rc.2.24474.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]   Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.35 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]   Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]   Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]   Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0-rc.2.24473.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]   Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.35 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]   Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]   Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]   Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.0-rc.2.24474.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

However, I pushed some changes today, and the build failed.\r\n\r\nFor every package referenced in the repo, I get lines like the following...\r\n\r\n>D:\\a\\Pixata.Utilities\\Pixata.Utilities\\Pixata.Blazor\\Pixata.Blazor.csproj : error NU1301: Failed to retrieve information about 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components' from remote source 'https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget/FindPackagesById()?id='Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components'&semVerLevel=2.0.0'.\r\n>D:\\a\\Pixata.Utilities\\Pixata.Utilities\\Pixata.Blazor\\Pixata.Blazor.csproj : error NU1301:   Response status code does not indicate success: 503 (Service Unavailable).\r\n\r\nNotice that the package in question is not a Telerik one, so I have no idea why it's looking on the Telerik feed. Also, the Telerik feed is the second one in the `nuget.config` file, so I would have expected it to check the nuget feed first. Furthermore, if I open the package manager in Visual Studio and look for packages on the Telerik feed, it finds them fine, which implies that the feed is working fine.\r\n\r\nI tried commenting out the line in `nuget.config` that references the Telerik feed, but that failed...\r\n\r\n>D:\\a\\Pixata.Utilities\\Pixata.Utilities\\Pixata.Blazor.TelerikComponents\\Pixata.Blazor.TelerikComponents.csproj : error NU1101: Unable to find package Telerik.UI.for.Blazor.

The build failed with the same results. Didn't try the nuget feed after the Telerik one failed.\r\n\r\nAnyone able to advise?

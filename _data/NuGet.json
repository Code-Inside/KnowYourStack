A fix would be nice\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n1. Table in README markdown looks ugly if some column contains a long text due to word wrap that breaks words in other columns even inside the inline code block. Compare rendered tables: Nuget https://www.nuget.org/packages/GlobRegex vs Github https://github.com/dscheg/GlobRegex\r\nGithub markdown looks good even on narrow screens. CSS to fix issue:\r\n```css\r\n.readme-common .table {\r\n  overflow: auto;\r\n  display: block;\r\n  word-break: normal;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. It might be better to have a horizontal scroll and turn off word wrap inside multiline code blocks, because it seems such code is hard to read, given that there are no line numbers and display of hyphens: it is not always clear whether the EOL is in the code itself or word wraping has been applied. The same example links above. CSS to fix issue: `pre code { white-space: pre; }` instead of `pre code { white-space: pre-wrap; }`\r\n\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nCreate readme for the package with:\r\n1. Table with 3 columns with a long text inside the middle column\r\n2. Multiple long lines inside multiline code block\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. Table looks good even with long text in some column\r\n2.

It uses our self signed company wide root ca. So I though i would just include our ca in the build container, well it worked for curl, but nuget still seems to just ignore it... Can I somehow specify the the cert store to be used? Or why does it ignore the system one in the first place. Same happens with the \"7.0\" tag of the sdk. Alpine or not does not seem to change anything.\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n1. Have a nuget feed with a self signed HTTPS certificate\r\n2. Use one of those packages in a project & configure nuget.config to use the nuget feed\r\n3. Try to build / nuget restore the project inside a docker multistep build\r\n\r\nDockerfile, this is all that the CI executes after checking out the git repo.\r\n```\r\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0-alpine AS build\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /src\r\nCOPY . .\r\nCOPY [\"agenda-root-ca.crt\", \"/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/\"] # copying our self signed ca\r\nRUN update-ca-certificates # update the system certs\r\n\r\n# this FAILS if the above two commands would not setup the certificate!!!\r\nRUN curl https://teamcity-nuget.agenda.de/guestAuth/app/nuget/feed/_Root/default/v3/index.json # debug only\r\n\r\nWORKDIR \"/src/BrainLogApi\"\r\n\r\nRUN dotnet restore --verbosity d # debug only, publish already does it\r\nRUN dotnet publish \"BrainLogApi.csproj\" -c Release -o /app/publish\r\n\r\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0-alpine\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\nCOPY --from=build /app/publish .\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \"Agenda.BrainLogApi.dll\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also saw that package add prints the inner exception so here it is.

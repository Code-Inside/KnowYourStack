This has served us well for many years but, as the protocol demands, the catalog is append only so the catalog `index.json` will only grow as the number of catalog leaves accumulates. To slow down the `index.json` growth rate we can increase the page size.\r\n\r\nThis will give us more time to plan a fully scalable solution (e.g. https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7787).\r\n\r\nThe downloads.v1.json file is over 100 MB and still parses fine but the difference here is that the catalog index.json may be downloaded much more frequently (to poll for catalog commits). A smaller file is better.\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nWe should add the ability to configure the page size. It's a .NET constant right now of 550. We should increase it to a larger size. The value of 1650 seems to be working just fine in DEV for several weeks\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nWe have an internal discussion [on Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:d10cd9192de2492986fba3baeea3093c@thread.skype/1652468991222?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=ad34ac55-6785-4e7c-82c3-7ba405d30c3c&parentMessageId=1652468991222&teamName=NuGet&channelName=Server&createdTime=1652468991222).\r\n\r\nThe index.json size over time is here:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94054/174692360-048bc4e8-dc22-4a77-8acb-cc511f156bab.png)\r\n(y = bytes, x = month)\r\n\r\nWe already have several jumbo pages from deprecations:\r\nPageUrl | LeafCount | max_CommitTimestamp\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nhttps://api.nuget.org/v3/catalog0/page9598.json | 1728 | 2020-02-09 13:04:53.7647929\r\nhttps://api.nuget.org/v3/catalog0/page10769.json | 1183 | 2020-08-20 19:28:36.8641381\r\nhttps://api.nuget.org/v3/catalog0/page10770.json | 1134 | 2020-08-20 19:29:20.2945851\r\nhttps://api.nuget.org/v3/catalog0/page12124.json | 997 | 2021-03-12 10:27:09.9984875\r\nhttps://api.nuget.org/v3/catalog0/page10857.json | 839 | 2020-09-03 13:35:37.7371129\r\n\r\nThe change in index.json MoM (month over month) is here:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94054/174692474-68b819e8-9203-4ca1-b085-cd5e0c13eb69.png)\r\n"},{"Id":"29472494639","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-01T19:15:43","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9504","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: 404 reason phrase is not properly returned for package unlist\" (#9504) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe reason phrase we configure in gallery for API 404 responses is clobbered by our default pretty 404 error page.

If so, how?  I don't see how I could \"add a dependency group for .NETCoreApp3.1 to the nuspec\" in this case.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, on the Azure Devops Server build pipeline we have `WarningsAsErros` enabled. There with SDK 3.1.116 the build did not break despite the aforementioned errors. with SDK 3.1.415 however, the build suddenly breaks. Why this change in behavior?

The following code is used to build the package\r\n\r\n`<MSBuild Projects=\"$(BuildSolutionDir)/Mares.Scheduler.Api.Client/Mares.Scheduler.Api.Client.csproj\" Targets=\"Restore\" />\r\n<MSBuild Projects=\"$(BuildSolutionDir)/Mares.Scheduler.Api.Client/Mares.Scheduler.Api.Client.csproj\"\r\n\t\t\t\t Targets=\"Build;Pack\"\tProperties=\"Configuration=$(Configuration);PackageOutputPath=$(NuGetPackageDir);Authors=$(Authors);Version=$(Version)\" />`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. step two: push packages with a powershell script to nuget server (hosted in iis 10).  some package need 250ms to be pushed, other need more than 30sec.  The following is the code I use to push the package\r\n\r\n`$PackagePath = \"$(Get-Location)\\Packages\"\r\nGet-ChildItem $PackagePath -Filter *.nupkg|\r\nForeach-Object {\r\n    Invoke-Expression \"$($NugetPath) push $($_.FullName) -Source $($NugetApi) -ApiKey $($NugetApiKey) -Verbosity detailed\" \r\n    Remove-Item $_.FullName\r\n}`\r\n\r\nThe strange behaviour occur when publishing new packets and when replacing existing packets.  It looks like nuget server rebuild some cache\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\nNuGet Version: 5.11.0.10\r\nPushing Mares.Scheduler.Api.Client.3.0.2.nupkg to 'http://192.168.34.200:81/api/v2/package'...\r\n  PUT http://192.168.34.200:81/api/v2/package/\r\n  Created http://192.168.34.200:81/api/v2/package/ 45121ms\r\nYour package was pushed.\n```\n"},{"Id":"19103339910","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-30T02:30:54","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9829","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow to user to input custom (floating) versions through the PM UI\" (#9829) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Change version input to a Combo Box displaying available version depending on the user input.

However, since .NET 5 introduced `net5.0-windows` as a target framework, this is now a combination of MSBuild `TargetFrameworkMoniker` and `TargetPlatformMoniker`. The BCL's `FrameworkName` cannot handle this, making all platform specific target frameworks indistinguishable from the no-platform target framework.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nVS extension developers using these NuGet APIs should update to newer versions of the interfaces which use `IVsNuGetFramework`, which has fields for both `TargetFrameworkMoniker`, and `TargetPlatformMoniker` (plus `TargetPlatformMinVersion`, important for UWP projects)\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1458922810328371207","CreatedAt":"2021-11-11T22:21:18+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Hi friends 👋\n\nHelp us deliver an amazing target framework filtering package search experience by reviewing our prop… https://t.co/AYWrsHhZcZ","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":13,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1457785562614493192","CreatedAt":"2021-11-08T19:02:17+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🚢 Announcing #NuGet 6.0! \n \n📍 Source mapping\n6️⃣ .NET 6 Support\n🔒 Package Vulnerabilities\n🧑‍🔬 Retry &amp; Backoff Behav… https://t.co/qIK6tRSw87","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":165,"FavoriteCount":61,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1448351779423457281","CreatedAt":"2021-10-13T18:15:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Help us understand your package push workflow! https://t.co/7zALBMJ0xH","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":2,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1438283829102456833","CreatedAt":"2021-09-15T23:29:21+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🙌New feature announcement🙌\n\nMap packages to target sources using Package Source Mapping 🗺️\n\nSecuring your package s… https://t.co/UCSO5dcMpz","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":69,"FavoriteCount":30,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1417880494994198529","CreatedAt":"2021-07-21T16:13:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi will be migrating towards a new multi-CDN infrastructure.

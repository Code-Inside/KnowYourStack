query.\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nFor Fable,\r\nan F# to JavaScript, Python, Dart, etc. compiler we are hosting packages on NuGet.\r\n\r\nUsers have a hard time discovering what Fable packages are available. We have the idea of using tags like:\r\n\r\n- `fable`\r\n- `fable-binding`\r\n- `fable-library`\r\n- `fable-javascript`\r\n- `fable-dart`\r\n- `fable-python`\r\n\r\nto make it possible to filter the packages that the user want to search.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that if the user want to search for a Fable package, we can search by the tag `fable`.\r\n\r\nIf he want all the library which works for both JavaScript and Dart, he can search using `fable-library` AND `fable-javascript` AND `fable-dart`.\r\n\r\nHowever, right now the search API and NuGet.org only support by searching by one tag.\r\n\r\nTaking the following package available on NuGet.org\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4760796/189925526-835e77a1-a78d-4b50-b7ad-8452f37f3e4d.png)\r\n\r\nIf we search by `fable` AND `fable-binding` then we get 360 results instead of only 1. Searched value `Tags:\"fable\" Tags:\"fable-binding\"`\r\n\r\nIf we search by `fable-binding` AND `fable` then we get 1 results. Searched value `Tags:\"fable-binding\" Tags:\"fable\"`\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe that only the first tag is actually used.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"23977523542","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-09-13T12:48:21","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9229","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix bug causing reduced vulnerabilities version ranges to not flow into V3\" (#9229) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Entity Framework clears dependent collections when the parent entity is removed from the DB context.

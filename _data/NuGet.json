The current setup involves a mono repo structure with a common `Packages.props` file and multiple solutions within the \"Solutions\" directory. The solutions rely on a `GlobalPackageReference` defined in the common `Packages.props` file.\r\n\r\nThe migration plan involves moving solutions one by one and updating the package management configuration. For instance, when migrating \"Solution1,\" the new structure would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRepository\r\n|-- Solutions\r\n|   |-- Directory.Packages.Props    (Common Central Package Management configuration with transitive pinned packages (PackageVersion and GlobalPackageReference)\r\n|   |-- Solution1\r\n|       |-- Directory.Packages.Props (Solution-specific configuration:<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>, <CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>true</CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>,<Import Project=\"$([MSBuild]::GetPathOfFileAbove('Directory.Packages.props', '$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\\'))\" />)\r\n|   |-- Solution2 (to be migrated later)\r\n|       |-- Directory.Packages.Props (Solution-specific configuration: <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>false</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>, <Import Project=\"$([MSBuild]::GetPathOfFileAbove('Directory.Packages.props', '$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\\'))\" />)\r\n|   |-- Solution3 (to be migrated later)\r\n|       |-- Directory.Packages.Props (Solution-specific configuration: <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>false</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>, <Import Project=\"$([MSBuild]::GetPathOfFileAbove('Directory.Packages.props', '$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\\'))\" />)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue arises when attempting to use the same `Directory.Packages.Props` file for both CPM-enabled and CPM-disabled solutions. Solutions with `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` set as true can successfully retrieve the `GlobalPackageReference` from the parent `Directory.Packages.Props` file. However, solutions with `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` set as false are unable to access these packages from the parent file.\r\n\r\n**Previously, we had a `Packages.props` file in the root of our repository, but eve after adding `Directory.Packages.props` to the service, it would read the `PropertyGroup` tag from `Directory.Packages.props` inside the solution, but read the `ItemGroup` tag from `Properties.props` which is the most weird behavior** \r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would like to have a single `Directory.Packages.Props` file that accommodates both CPM-enabled and CPM-disabled solutions, ensuring that all solutions can access the necessary packages.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Migrate a solution to use Central Package Management with Transitive Pinning.\r\n2. Ensure that the `Directory.Packages.Props` file for the migrated solution includes `<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>` and `<CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>true</CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>`.\r\n3. Migrate another solution, but set `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` to false for this solution.\r\n4. Observe that Solution2 is unable to retrieve the necessary packages from the parent Directory.Packages.Props file.\r\n\r\nIf there is a workaround or solution to enable the use of the same file for both CPM-enabled and CPM-disabled solutions, please provide guidance.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance in resolving this issue.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_"},{"Id":"35057972630","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-23T17:17:48","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13184","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"LibraryDependency creates a collection that is mostly empty\" (#13184) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe, MSBuild.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nAll\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nNone\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nThe `LibraryDependency` creates a list for warnings but in a lot of code paths it ends up being empty so there's no need to allocate the list and instead it could be an empty singleton.\n\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/a6fff16af6f44927a83851448a99beb1d2801600/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.LibraryModel/LibraryDependency.cs#L22\n\nOriginally reported internally: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1826369\n\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"35057708575","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-23T17:09:03","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13183","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"PackageSpecWriter should write out original string for versions instead of allocating a new one (1.4% of high-GC sessions, 152 MB/s at worst)\" (#13183) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nMSBuild.exe, dotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nAll\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nNone\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nThe `SetCentralDependencies` method writes out the PackageVersion items to the `project.assets.json` and uses the normalized version.

Ensure that the `Directory.Packages.Props` file for the migrated solution includes `<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>` and `<CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>true</CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>`.\r\n3. Migrate another solution, but set `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` to false for this solution.\r\n4. Observe that Solution2 is unable to retrieve the necessary packages from the parent Directory.Packages.Props file.\r\n\r\nIf there is a workaround or solution to enable the use of the same file for both CPM-enabled and CPM-disabled solutions, please provide guidance.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance in resolving this issue.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"35033592987","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-23T01:13:57","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13180","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"`BuildAssetsUtilsTests` tests shouldn't depend on host machine envvars\" (#13180) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"On my Windows machine, I have envvar `NUGET_PACKAGES` set.

But the form it brings them down leaves actually putting them together into a usable directory as an out-of-scope problem.  If you're working on C# source-code, this is fine.  But if you're trying to handle an .exe that lives in a nuget package, or if you're trying to access a nuget package in Powershell or CSX script, you can't actually load it because its dependencies are outside of the module search path.  These are the cases when I *want* to use `nuget.exe` - if I just wanted the raw packages folders, I'd use normal `csproj` stuff where the compiler would handle putting together my bin folder for me.  If I'm using `nuget.exe`, I'm already trying to get stuff from nuget so I can *hack* with it.\r\n\r\nSo, a proposal, call it \"nuget deploy\".  As in \r\n\r\n```ps\r\nnuget deploy mypackagename -OutputDirectory ./packages -DeployDirectory ./bin -Framework netcore\r\n\r\nAdd-Type -path './bin/myPackageName.dll'\r\n[MyPackageClass]::StaticHelloWorld()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty straightforward use of Nuget.exe, and yet the amount of code it requires is very very non-trivial.  See the Tolstoy at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39257572/loading-assemblies-from-nuget-packages\r\n\r\n### Additional Context and Details\r\n\r\nDetailed example.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if I do this:\r\n\r\n```ps\r\nnuget install Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild -o ./packages\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get MsBuild and all its dependencies in `./packages`.  Which is great!  But if I try to use the copy of `SqlPackage.exe` that lives in there, I get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> .\\packages\\Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild.16.0.62004.28040\\lib\\net46\\SqlPackage.exe\r\n\r\nUnhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Data.Tools.Utilities, Version=15.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Tools.Schema.CommandLineTool.Program.Main(String[] args)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is sad.  I have the file, I have the dependencies, it's just I have to put them together myself.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir bin -Force\r\ncp packages/*/lib/net46/* bin -Force\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then try it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> .\\bin\\SqlPackage.exe | select-object -First 3 # we don't want the whole help doc\r\nSqlPackage: Command-line tool for creating and deploying SQL Server databases and DACPAC packages.\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it works if you're willing to deploy the files out of the packages folder yourself.  Nuget being able to help with this would be fantastic.\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe offers a similar service in `dotnet tool install` but it only allows things that are flagged as *tools*, and is very netcore oriented and so doesn't really work well with old framework things like nuget.exe does.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> dotnet tool install Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild --tool-path ./bin\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\zaratem\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\fc86e76c-4d47-498e-8a10-e120aaaa7ea3\\restore.csproj : error NU1212: Invalid project-package combination for Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild 16.0.62004.28040. DotnetToolReference project style\r\n can only contain references of the DotnetTool type\r\nThe tool package could not be restored.\r\nTool 'microsoft.data.tools.msbuild' failed to install. This failure may have been caused by:\r\n\r\n* You are attempting to install a preview release and did not use the --version option to specify the version.\r\n* A package by this name was found, but it was not a .NET tool.\r\n* The required NuGet feed cannot be accessed, perhaps because of an Internet connection problem.\r\n* You mistyped the name of the tool.\r\n\r\nFor more reasons, including package naming enforcement, visit https://aka.ms/failure-installing-tool\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut for anything else, `dotnet tool install` does what we'd expect - it dumps the files I want to play with in the `bin` folder with all their dependencies where it needs them for when it's loaded into memory."},{"Id":"32959846568","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-10-30T19:11:26","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12973","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Problem of shared project.assets.json\" (#12973) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\n7.0.403\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt bothers me.

To make the bug reproduceable,  `NuGetProjectAssets.NET70.csproj` is set as dependency project of `NuGetProjectAssets.csproj`, so that `NuGetProjectAssets.NET70.csproj` will build before `NuGetProjectAssets.csproj`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `project.assets.json` file are shared between different project files.

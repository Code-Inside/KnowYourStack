This isn't trivial the moment and is dependent on the fact that the author of the type has relevant documentation to point its consumers to the right nuget package which isn't always straightforward.\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nMost times we start off with an API/interface of interest by looking at docs or searching for other references of it. It ought to be easy for consumers to go from there to a nuget package they could consume in their solutions. At the moment this isn't as simple as searching for the type name in nuget/a private feed and the UX showing up a list of packages that contain the type being searched for. This both improves discoverability and ease of mapping any API to a nuget package as long as it has been indexed. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if this experience was built into both the web client and other desktop clients as well.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"21868182442","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T01:44:39","Actor":"drewgillies","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9120","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Remove unused field from ConfigurationService\" (#9120) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"21859000287","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-18T16:17:42","Actor":"philipstratford","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9121","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: Unable to connect to NuGet - \"...connection forcibly closed by the remote host\"\" (#9121) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"21844835609","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-18T02:56:41","Actor":"drewgillies","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9120","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Remove unused field from ConfigurationService\" (#9120) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"21969598877","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-25T01:34:50","Actor":"yangskyboxlabs","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11836","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: Hierarchical nuget.config files are ignored when `-configFile` parameter is used\" (#11836) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nNuGet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.1.0, 5.3.1\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nWhen `-configFile` option is used to invoke NuGet.exe, hierarchical configuration support appears to be disabled.

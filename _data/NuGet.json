But, if you use `-PackageDirectory` on the command-line, it redirects _both_ of these restore operations, when, I think, it should only set the path for the first one. The result is that the packages restored for `<PackageReference>` that were supposed to go into the central folder for the user profile instead get placed into the `packages` folder in the project. This in turn causes problems because the first phase writes packages to the folder with V2 layout, and the second phase writes them with V3 layout. The result is a `packages` folder that is essentially damaged because of the mixed formats. I observed NuGet Pack to subsequently fail, because it assumes the packages directory it is looking at will be _either_ V2 or V3 but never both, and because of this assumption, the first folder it sees determines what it expects for all other references -- but my `NuGet Pack` operation required it to read a reference restored with V2 format, and the first folder it saw was a V3 folder.\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1. Create a solution with two projects, one of which uses `packages.config` and the other one `<PackageReference>`. Ensure that each project references at least one NuGet package.\r\n\r\n2. Run `NuGet Restore` on the solution with `-PackageDirectory` overriding the location of the `packages` folder.\r\n\r\nAfter this operation, what I expect you will see is a `packages` folder where some packages are installed into folders like `log4net.2.0.8` while others are installed into folders like `fluentassertions/5.0.3`.\r\n"},{"Id":"12337580144","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-05-14T15:11:29","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9562","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Warnings for existing code in xplat verification branch from CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzer\" (#9562) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"The following warnings are reported by CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzer in the existing code on xplat feature branch, as new overload methods were brought in for new TFM:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSigning\\Timestamp\\Rfc3161TimestampVerificationUtility.cs(40,17): error CA1307: The behavior of 'string.Equals(string)' could vary based on the current user's locale settings.

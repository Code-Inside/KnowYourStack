A future PR will update the service layer to emit then audit records. This PR enables us to update our internal auditing layer to handle the new audit records before actually emitting them.\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR I needed to extract the `FederatedCredentialIssuerType` enum as a public enum, so it can enrich the audit entries. Previously it was an implementation detail of the service layer.\r\n\r\nThe following steps of the end-to-end OIDC flow are audited:\r\n1. Creation of a federated credential policy\r\n2. Validating a bearer token against a well-known issuer (e.g. Entra ID OIDC JWT validation)\r\n3. Comparing a bearer token with a policy\r\n4.

When a federated credential is used, it is tracked in the database to avoid credential replay (reuse). An example federated credential would be an OpenID Connect (OIDC) token from a trusted external identity provider, such as Entra ID.\r\n>\r\n> **Federated credential policy**\r\n> A set of criteria to determine whether a given federated credential is acceptable to be used to operate on behalf of a specific user. This can be considered a trust policy of an external identity provided, expressed by a user of NuGet Gallery.\r\n>\r\n> **Policy user**\r\n> This is the user account that manages the federated credential policy. This will be the user that the generated short-lived API keys will be owned by.\r\n>\r\n> **Policy package owner**\r\n> This is the user or organization account that the API key will act on behalf of. This is different from the policy user because the package owner can be an organization. The policy package owner will become the owner scope on the short-lived API key created from the policy.\r\n> \r\n> **Policy type**\r\n> This is the type of federated credential that is accepted by the policy. The policy type determines how the policy criteria are interpreted. An example policy type would be an Entra ID service principal policy, which would accept Entra ID OIDC bearer tokens containing a specific tenant ID and object ID referring to a service principal.\r\n> \r\n> **Policy criteria**\r\n> These are criteria specific to a certain policy type and specified by the user. An example of some policy criteria would be a tenant ID and object ID pair for an Entra ID service principal."},{"Id":"44631706113","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-12-10T05:37:29","Actor":"1RJB","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10302","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"init.ps1 is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program\" (#10302) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

It is expected that the `copyToOutput` property is set to `true` in this case.\n\nBy manually editing `nuget.spec` after package creation and adding `copyToOutput=true` for `file` elements, the desired behavior can be achieved using the otherwise exactly same package.\n\n## References\n\n* https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-contentfiles-demystified/#other-options\n* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#using-the-contentfiles-element-for-content-files\n* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-items?view=vs-2022#content\n\n### Analysis\n\n* Lacking documentation does not explain how to obtain the desired result in a NuGet package when using `Content` in a `.xproj` file to always output files to the consuming project's output directory.\n* Bug in `Content` when `CopyToOutputDirectory` is set to a value other than `Never` in `PackageReferece`-based dependency declarations.\n* Missing `CopyToOutput` boolean property in `Content` that mirrors `file>copyToOutput` property in `nuget.spec`. (Seems redundant when `CopyToOutputDirectory` exists.)\n\nHowever, given that the expected result can be obtained when using Project to Project references, this issue appears to be a bug.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n## .NET info\n\n```powershell\ndotnet --info\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.c6f19616\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.22631\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.100\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n**Note:** The same problem can be observed in earlier versions of .NET."},{"Id":"44624110458","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-12-09T22:49:04","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13992","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"New dependency resolver does not handle floating versions correctly in some situations\" (#13992) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe, MSBuild.exe, NuGet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.12\n\n### Worked before?\n\nYes, 6.11\n\n### Impact\n\nNone\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nProjects that use floating versions with the new dependency resolver can have issues with resolved packages.

Please note that I'm not just talking about specifying a filepath to a local .nupkg file. What this solves is development without a publish step and without a build step into a .nupkg.\r\n```\r\n<Project>\r\n\t<PropertyGroup>\r\n\t\t<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>\r\n\t\t<CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>true</CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>\r\n\t</PropertyGroup>\r\n\t<ItemGroup>\r\n\t  <PackageVersion Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"13.0.3\" />\r\n\t  <PackageVersion Include=\"ClassLibrary1\" Version=\"1.0.0\" Path=\"..\\..\\ClassLibrary1\\ClassLibrary1\\ClassLibrary1.csproj\" />\r\n\t</ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Longer scenario description:**\r\nConsoleApp1 has a nuget reference to ClassLibrary1. Now I want to test local changes I made to ClassLibrary1. This is a very common usecase, you could argue that this is the primary usecase of having libraries. Sure I want my code to be isolated in another place but that doesn't mean that I want endless friction when actually developing this library which by definition will be used in possibly many other places. Alas in c# if I choose to use nuget packages I'm immediately entering that territory of endless friction because I'm forced to manually convert my nuget references in my entire solution to project references. Each time I want to test either the published package or test my local stashed changes I have to do this manual \"vendoring/linking\" step.\r\n\r\n**Comparison with other languages/package managers:**\r\nI think this is mostly a solved usecase by other package managers. Npm has 'link' and many other \"workspace\" tools, either built into npm/pnpm or another way from Microsoft via rushstack. Golang has the vendor system which is not exactly the same but it sort of solves this issue as well because each time you change the location of the package from an url to a filepath it should vendor itself correctly again and afaik you are coding directly against your symlinked local code.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context and Details\r\n\r\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2024-12-11T03:30:22.2041205Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":942}

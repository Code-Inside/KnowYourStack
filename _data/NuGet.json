For example, NuGet.Server does not support retrieving api keys from secret managers like the Vault. \n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nI would like to use my own custom PackageAuthenticationService that implements a more secure approach, such as using ephemeral API keys from the Vault.  I have modified the PackageAuthenticationService and added it to my ASP.NET Web Application (NET Framework) project but there doesn't seem to be any clear way to set NuGet.Server to use my custom class over it's built in one, maybe besides writing a custom resolver and setting NuGetODataConfig.cs to use my resolver instead.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to accomplish what I want to accomplish, and if not, can it be implemented?   So NuGet.Server uses a custom PackageAuthenticationService?

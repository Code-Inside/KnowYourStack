But so long as it was built previously (either at the command line or while loaded in Visual Studio) the rest of the solution should build successfully even across project references that include this unloaded project because the binaries are on disk.\n\nBut with NuGet and project.json, this has regressed. When a project is unloaded that is in the middle of a chain of project references and that chain is what propagates dependencies from a project.json file at a root project, that causes solution build to fail. When the solution build starts, nuget restore rewrites all the project.json files an does so differently than a command line \"nuget restore\" command. In VS, it seems package restore is based on loaded VS projects, so the unloaded VS project causes a partial package restore failure. In particular, the project.json dependencies do not properly propagate to the projects that reference the unloaded project, resulting in build failures in these projects due to missing assembly references.\n\nHere is sample output from one such failed solution build (while CodeGeneration.Roslyn.Tests is unloaded):\n\n```\nRestoring NuGet packages...\nTo prevent NuGet from restoring packages during build, open the Visual Studio Options dialog, click on the Package Manager node and uncheck 'Allow NuGet to download missing packages during build.'\nFailed to resolve all project references for 'CodeGeneration.Roslyn.Tests.Generators'.

So very obviously VS is rewriting the project.lock.json files when building, resulting in this failure.\n\nThis breaks scenarios the benefit or even require unloaded projects (such as in my case, where a loaded project results in assemblies getting loaded and locked in the devenv.exe process which breaks the build which rewrites that assembly).\n\n**Repro steps**\n1. Create a new solution.\n2. Add class library **A** project and a project.json to it.\n3. Add a dependency on the nuget Validation package to that project.json file (or any package that delivers assemblies).\n4. Add class library **B**, and a project.json to it.\n5. Add a _project_ reference from B to A.\n6. Add class library **C**, and a project.json to it.\n7. Add a _project_ reference from C to B.\n8. Add a class to class library **C** and a method that calls `Validation.Assumes.True(true);`\n9. Build the solution. Everything works.\n10. Unload project **B**.\n11. Build the solution. This time, the build breaks because `Validation.Assumes` cannot be found.\n12. At the command line, observe that \"nuget restore\" followed by a command line build of the solution works.\n13. Build the solution in VS again. The build is still broken.\n"},{"Id":"12304271041","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-05-11T20:12:08","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8724","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Cannot find version of nuget.exe pack that supports <icon>\" (#8724) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: NuGet.exe\r\n\r\nNuGet version: 5.3.0.6260\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): Win 10 19H1\r\n\r\nWorked before?

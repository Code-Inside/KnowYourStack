For example, maybe something like this:\r\n\r\n> myproject.csproj: error NU1123: lock file is missing package. Rerun restore with force evaluate.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThe root cause is here: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/a0c03e4dbc43346510428561127c449a338b3920/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core/ResolverUtility.cs#L215-L217\r\n\r\nThe resolver is using the lock file, which is normal lock file restore behaviour. But since the dependency does not exist (for the current TFM) in the lock file, it doesn't know what version to use. The error message being report about not finding the package in any of the sources is just wrong, because it only tried the lock file, not the actual sources.

This was an accidental behavior regression where the <code>RegisterTypes</code> method wouldn't filter out non-registerable types.</li>\n<li><code>RegisterType&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RegisterType(Type t)</code> will now throw when non-registerable types are provided, for example <code>containerBuilder.RegisterType&lt;IInterface&gt;()</code> (you can't register <em>interfaces</em> - you can register things <code>As&lt;IInterface&gt;</code>). This used to throw at container build time; now it throws at <code>RegisterType</code> time and it has a more precise error message so you can handle these issues more proactively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/compare/v7.0.1...v7.1.0\">https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/compare/v7.0.1...v7.1.0</a></p>\n<h2>v7.0.1</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduced lock contention in <code>LifetimeScope.CreateSharedInstance</code> (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/botinko\"><code>@​botinko</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Optimized <code>Autofac.Features.OpenGenerics.OpenGenericServiceBinder.TryBindOpenGenericTypedService</code> (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/SergeiPavlov\"><code>@​SergeiPavlov</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1\">https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1</a></p>\n<h2>v7.0.0</h2>\n<p>Version 7.0.0 is a major increment due to some changes in the target frameworks and some behavioral changes. <a href=\"https://autofac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whats-new/upgradingfrom6to7.html\">We summarize these in the documentation</a>, but included here as well:</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Properties marked <code>required</code> will now be injected by default.</strong> As part of this, the default property injector using <code>PropertiesAutowired()</code> will <em>not</em> inject properties marked <code>required</code>. <a href=\"https://autofac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/register/prop-method-injection.html#required-properties\">The documentation has more explanation with examples.</a></li>\n<li><strong>Ability to isolate <code>AssemblyLoadContext</code> by lifetime scope.</strong> A new method, <code>BeginLoadContextLifetimeScope</code>, has been added that allows you to create a lifetime scope tied to a specific <code>AssemblyLoadContext</code>. When the scope is disposed, Autofac will perform a best-effort release of all references to types from that context so the assemblies can be unloaded. <a href=\"https://autofac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/scopes-loadcontexts.html\">The documentation explains this in greater detail.</a></li>\n<li><strong>Documentation links in exception messages.</strong> Common Autofac exceptions now include links to <a href=\"https://autofac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting/index.html#exceptions\">our online documentation</a> to help you understand what the exceptions mean and how to troubleshoot them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Issues and PRs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add documentation links to common exceptions by <a href=\"https://github.com/tillig\"><code>@​tillig</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1359\">autofac/Autofac#1359</a></li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/1360\">#1360</a>: Unify the &quot;no constructors found&quot; reporting by <a href=\"https://github.com/tillig\"><code>@​tillig</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1362\">autofac/Autofac#1362</a></li>\n<li>Add support for required properties by <a href=\"https://github.com/alistairjevans\"><code>@​alistairjevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1364\">autofac/Autofac#1364</a></li>\n<li>Mark RegisterGeneratedFactory obsolete by <a href=\"https://github.com/tillig\"><code>@​tillig</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1366\">autofac/Autofac#1366</a></li>\n<li>Isolate service information computed in child scopes from the parent scope by <a href=\"https://github.com/alistairjevans\"><code>@​alistairjevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/pull/1350\">autofac/Autofac#1350</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/compare/v6.5.0...v7.0.0\">https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/compare/v6.5.0...v7.0.0</a></p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>net50</code> no longer targeted.</strong> Autofac will still work with .NET 5 via the <code>netstandard2.1</code> target, but we recommend you upgrade to a later, supported version of .NET.</li>\n<li><strong>Properties marked <code>required</code> will now be injected by default.</strong> As noted above, <code>required</code> properties will be injected. This is a behavioral change from Autofac 6.0.</li>\n<li><strong>Default property injection ignores <code>required</code> properties.</strong> Using <code>PropertiesAutowired()</code> will ignore <code>required</code> properties because it's assumed they must be set during construction rather than post-object-creation.</li>\n<li><strong><code>RegisterGeneratedFactory</code> is obsolete.</strong> This feature has been replaced by the <code>Func&lt;X, Y, B&gt;</code> built-in relationship and delegate factories.</li>\n<li><strong><code>ILifetimeScope</code> has a new <code>BeginLoadContextLifetimeScope</code> method.</strong> If you have mocks of <code>ILifetimeScope</code> this method must now be implemented.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v6.5.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reflection caches have moved to a central location <code>Autofac.Core.ReflectionCacheSet</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/1341\">#1341</a>).

See https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4259 for more context.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nWe should enable this retry behavior by default with reasonable values and the same restrictions (i.e.:  untrusted status on Windows) while still allowing users to override or opt-out of the default.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we choose `3,1000` as the default, a user could override by setting the environment variable with different values:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset NUGET_EXPERIMENTAL_CHAIN_BUILD_RETRY_POLICY=10,3000\r\n```\r\n\r\nA user could also opt out (meaning, no retry at all) with a different value (TBD, but possibly just `0`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nset NUGET_EXPERIMENTAL_CHAIN_BUILD_RETRY_POLICY=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nA [GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=NUGET_EXPERIMENTAL_CHAIN_BUILD_RETRY_POLICY&type=code) reveals `3,1000` as the most common value, with `9,2000` being next most common.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThe root problem is that a particular API call isn't retried, and it should be.  Whether or not Windows adds a retry, retrying is the only mitigation.  We can broadly mitigate this issue for NuGet users by retrying by default.\r\n\r\nCC @joelverhagen"},{"Id":"31497856630","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T05:01:20","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12858","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Upgrade Newtonsoft.Json reference to 13.0.3\" (#12858) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":".NET repos currently have a mix of Newtonsoft.Json versions that we're trying to get consolidated into the latest version.

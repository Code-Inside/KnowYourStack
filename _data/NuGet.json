A fix would be nice\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen using open source software packages, most OSS licenses require that you copy forward the developer's copyright statement. When the SPDX templates for OSS licenses (like the MIT license) are used on Nuget packages, the copyright information is not included, and we have to navigate to the github repository or elsewhere to get the \"real\" copy of the OSS license with the copyright information. I am requesting that, instead of using SPDX open source license templates, either use the real copyright holder's copy of the open source license that includes their copyright statement, or just say something like \"this is licensed under MIT\" and leave it at that instead of linking to an empty template. The current setup is unclear and causes developers to miss copying in the real copyright statement when these packages are used. \n\n### Repro Steps\n\nGo to any package licensed under MIT (example: https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/8.0.10). Click on \"MIT.\" See the SPDX template instead of the developers actual copy of the MIT license with the copyright statement. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWould love the \"MIT\" link to link to the developer's copy of the MIT license with their copyright statement at the top. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"43153659198","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-24T04:03:24","Actor":"v-manil2","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10235","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[ReleasePrep][2024.10.23]RI of dev into main\" (#10235) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"43137790550","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-23T16:23:35","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10236","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Revert \"Improve API key v4 implementation based on internal feedback\"\" (#10236) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Reverts NuGet/NuGetGallery#10234.\r\n\r\nThis place needs to be updated first to detect the new format:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/security-utilities/blob/dd491f725a22796e25b52ccb677d305558793f29/src/Microsoft.Security.Utilities.Core/PreciselyClassifiedSecurityKeys/SEC101_030_NuGetApiKey.cs#L15"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"43242937999","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-27T12:23:44","Actor":"oztarc","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13885","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NU3003 - NU1701 - NU1701\" (#13885) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\n.NET runtimes installed:   Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.35 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]   Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]   Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0-rc.2.24474.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]   Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.35 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]   Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]   Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]   Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0-rc.2.24473.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]   Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.35 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]   Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]   Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]   Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.0-rc.2.24474.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

Here are some requests, categorized by need.\r\n\r\nIn general, we want Audit to be a great dev tool and not to be enabled in CI (in its current form). This duality-experience isn't well-supported today.\r\n\r\n## Dev-time\r\n\r\n- `dotnet add package` should fail for vulnerable packages. It's not obvious why success + warn is the best model, particularly for conservative organizations.\r\n- `dotnet add package` should have some form of `--transitive-cpm` as a CLI gesture for adding transitive CPM dependencies.\r\n- `dotnet list package --include-transitive --vulnerable` seems like a lot of ceremony to get a full list of vulnerable packages. There should be a low-ceremony way to get this information.\r\n\r\n## CI\r\n\r\n- A commit check (like how linters work) would be a great way to run Audit. This means that if a PR was green and a new relevant vulnerability was published, the PR would still be mergeable with no warnings. This is the same way linters work. If the source doesn't change, there are no new errors.\r\n- Post-merge, CI builds never fail due to Audit and Audit doesn't download the vulnerability data since it isn't being used.\r\n- We don't need to add nuget.org as an audit source. Every AzDo feed should expose the same information. It's just a feature of both nuget.org and Azdo.\r\n\r\n## Auxiliary testing\r\n\r\n- There is a good pattern to re-enable Audit for non-CI builds, like a rolling build.\r\n- There is a way to use Audit with additional (pre-disclosure) vulnerability information.\r\n- Audit also flags deprecated packages, which are assumed vulnerable.\r\n\r\n## Binary layouts\r\n\r\n- We also ship apps (primarily tools). These often get scanned in container images by third party scanners. We'd like to be able to scan apps using the same database. `cargo audit` supports this, for example.\r\n\r\n## Publisher tools\r\n\r\n- More streamlined model for deprecating packages.\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"41298441972","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-08-23T22:18:02","Actor":"zhhyu","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/73","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Scream Test Impacting Alpine Linux Customers on 08/20/2024\" (#73) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"On **August 20, 2024**, NuGet.org will conduct a **scream test** that may affect **Alpine Linux** customers.

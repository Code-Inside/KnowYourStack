After uploading it to NuGet, I created a new project to reference the GeneralUpdate.Bowl NuGet package I uploaded. However, I found that these files only exist in the directory `C:\\Users\\xxx\\.nuget\\packages\\generalupdate.bowl\\1.0.3\\contentFiles\\any\\netstandard2.0` and are not copied to the bin directory of the referencing project upon rebuilding.\r\n\r\nI researched and found that the referencing project needs to add some copy code in the `.csproj` file, which seems very inconvenient. Ideally, it should work like a regular NuGet package, where the referencing project doesn't need to do anything extra besides referencing the NuGet package. I'm not sure if this requirement can be met, and I hope someone can help me solve this issue.

When a federated credential is used, it is tracked in the database to avoid credential replay (reuse). An example federated credential would be an OpenID Connect (OIDC) token from a trusted external identity provider, such as Entra ID.\r\n>\r\n> **Federated credential policy**\r\n> A set of criteria to determine whether a given federated credential is acceptable to be used to operate on behalf of a specific user. This can be considered a trust policy of an external identity provided, expressed by a user of NuGet Gallery.\r\n>\r\n> **Policy user**\r\n> This is the user account that manages the federated credential policy. This will be the user that the generated short-lived API keys will be owned by.\r\n>\r\n> **Policy package owner**\r\n> This is the user or organization account that the API key will act on behalf of. This is different from the policy user because the package owner can be an organization. The policy package owner will become the owner scope on the short-lived API key created from the policy.\r\n> \r\n> **Policy type**\r\n> This is the type of federated credential that is accepted by the policy. The policy type determines how the policy criteria are interpreted. An example policy type would be an Entra ID service principal policy, which would accept Entra ID OIDC bearer tokens containing a specific tenant ID and object ID referring to a service principal.\r\n> \r\n> **Policy criteria**\r\n> These are criteria specific to a certain policy type and specified by the user. An example of some policy criteria would be a tenant ID and object ID pair for an Entra ID service principal."},{"Id":"44259032985","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T17:43:20","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10289","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[OIDC 11] Add method to delete policy and associated API keys\" (#10289) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Progress on https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10212.\r\nDepends on https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/10288.\r\n\r\nThis PR add a new service method to delete an existing federated credential policy entity. It is the responsibility of the caller to fetch the entity from the entity context prior to calling the method.\r\n\r\nSince short-lived API keys can be associated with a federated credential policy, this PR also adds a new method to the `IFederatedCredentialRepository` interface to retrieve all short-lived API keys associated with a given policy so they can be deleted.\r\n\r\nI chose to manually cascade the deletion so that proper \"credential delete\" audit records (via the existing flow) are created, instead of depending on the DB to automatically cascade deletion.

The object ID and tenant ID of the service principal are assumed to exist. It is the responsibility of the user to provide good values. This is a relatively safe assumption because a non-existent service principal will not have tokens issued for it and future operations that leverage the created policy will only happen with a valid Entra ID JWT.

It prevents developer if he is interested into debugging fast only some part of code that does not use external sources at first.\n\nThe origin of the problem is when you use project with many dependencies that does not have published symbols.\nAs there is a cache for already found symbols that speed up symbol loading and downloading process, there is no process while loading symbols that speeds up determining that some symbols will be not available at all. Thought, each time starting the debug session, the symbol loading will try to find not published symbols on remote servers, if you use more than 1 remote location that will take extra time too. You can of course add manually the name of libraries that does not publish symbols to options in Visual Studio, but it is very time consuming process when you need to as 25-50 libraries like so.\nMore over each and every developer will have to do this, as those settings are local to the IDE installation.\n\nTherefore one of the proposals I suggest is to put loading into background, so developer can already work with locally available symbols which should be loaded first. And the experience will be better each time the VS finds more symbols on remote server.\n\nSecond option that I would suggest is a some button or dialog that summaries not found symbols in external servers, and be able to add them to exclusions so VS does not try to find them again. The problem with solution as so, is that VS will not try to get symbols once those will become available and will require manual action.\n\nBest regards,\nMaciej Klemarczyk\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 10/14/2021, 03:00 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)"},{"Id":"34209328324","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-12-15T19:17:25","Actor":"johnterickson","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13093","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Adding a `GlobalPackageReference` silently breaks `RestorePackagesConfig` throughout the repo\" (#13093) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nMSBuild.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n17.9.0-preview-23578-04+5fcddc790\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

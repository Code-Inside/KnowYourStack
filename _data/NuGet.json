A fix would be nice\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nMy package [WTelegramClient 4.0.0-dev.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WTelegramClient/4.0.0-dev.5#dependencies-body-tab) shows a dependency upon a package named MTProtoGenerator (source generator)\r\n\r\nBut:\r\n- that source generator is purely internal and used for compiling, isn't required by developers using my library\r\n- that source generator is referenced in csproj as a relative **ProjectReference OutputItemType=\"Analyzer\"** not **PackageReference** so it was never intended to appear as a public dependency\r\n\r\nNow the source of the problem may come from the fact that during the build of 4.0.0-dev.3, my build.yml process made the mistake to **nuget push MTProtoGenerator** that version as an independent package, instead of **nuget push WTelegramClient**.\r\nThis past error resulted in that package [MTProtoGenerator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MTProtoGenerator/) 4.0.0-dev.3 appearing on Nuget, and **I promptly requested to delete it.**\r\n\r\nBut apparently:\r\n- not all references to that package are deleted, as that page is still somewhat accessible https://www.nuget.org/packages/MTProtoGenerator/\r\n- every new build of WTelegramClient still show reference upon the supposedly public nuget package MTProtoGenerator (with non-existing versions), even though it should remain purely internal.\r\n\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nGo to https://www.nuget.org/packages/WTelegramClient/4.0.0-dev.5#dependencies-body-tab and see the wrong reference\r\nClick on the reference to see that page https://www.nuget.org/packages/MTProtoGenerator/ doesn't list any such package or matching versions.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMTProtoGenerator shouldn't be listed in the dependencies tabs, as it's an internal source generator that shouldn't have been pushed to Nuget, has been deleted, and isn't pushed anymore since that erroneous older version\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/11647984/3866ca4b-b5bd-49a1-9370-c3c584536398)\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/assets/11647984/7513653b-5a76-4f0c-9d76-4238a7d86354)\r\n\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\nFor reference, my csproj is here: https://github.com/wiz0u/WTelegramClient/blob/master/src/WTelegramClient.csproj\r\nAnd the erroneous \"push\" build logs is here: https://dev.azure.com/wiz0u/WTelegramClient/_build/results?buildId=1439&view=logs&j=739bb7ec-7296-5b40-7dff-ee3297bfdaa4&t=d9bfb359-425d-5e16-07d1-b614e6df3d4b\r\n(I fixed the build.yml since)\r\n"},{"Id":"36988803561","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-03-29T04:40:51","Actor":"advay26","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9859","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Parametrize framework badge code\" (#9859) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Fixes https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9793\r\n\r\nThis removes some duplication in our frontend code for the Framework Badges.

Package Management lets you reduce the required configuration for your packages throughout your application.\r\n\r\nAs I was upgrading NUnit.Analyzers, I was about to submit a bug because going from version ANY -> 4.1.0 adds PrivateAssets and IncludeAssets to the PackageVersion on the Directory.Packages.props instead of the PackageReference.\r\n\r\nBut then I thought, why shouldn't it work at the Directory.Packages.props level? If you're adding an analyzer, and you're hiding all of the analyzer assets, perhaps you're going to be setting PrivateAssets and IncludeAssets the same across the board.\r\n\r\nIf you're setting PrivateAssets=\"all\", but including Publish=\"true\", then perhaps you're going to be publishing that library throughout all of the projects that your Central Package Management manages.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"36963027666","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-03-28T10:53:29","Actor":"Mpdreamz","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13357","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Unable to upload new package due to CONFLICT despite package not existing on api.nuget.org yet.\" (#13357) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\nSDK 8\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use this version\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nWe had an issue publishing a new package through:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet nuget push '.artifacts/package/release/*.nupkg' -k ${REPO_API_KEY} --source ${REPO_API_URL} --skip-duplicate --no-symbols\r\n``` \r\n\r\nREPO_API_URL:  https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\r\nREPO_API_KEY: an API key that we use all the time that has full access to publish to `Elastic.*` and the account belongs to one with full access to the reserved Elastic.* prefix\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/elastic/elastic-otel-dotnet/actions/runs/8454527480/job/23163725827\r\n\r\n```\r\nPushing Elastic.OpenTelemetry.1.0.0-alpha.1.nupkg to 'https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package'...\r\n  PUT https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/\r\n  Conflict https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/ 449ms\r\nPackage '/home/runner/work/elastic-otel-dotnet/elastic-otel-dotnet/.artifacts/package/release/Elastic.OpenTelemetry.1.0.0-alpha.1.nupkg' already exists at feed 'https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is strange because at the time: https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/elastic.opentelemetry/index.json returned a BLOB not found. \r\n\r\nIn the end we had to resort to uploading the package manually through the gallery web UI and this worked without a hitch.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.OpenTelemetry/1.0.0-alpha.1\r\n\r\nHowever this breaks our provenance attestations. \r\n\r\nWe'll likely to another automated release soon so I will report back if this problem is isolated to the push of a new package.\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"36557473750","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-03-14T16:05:16","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/72","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as April 8th, 2024\" (#72) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as April 8th, 2024.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.

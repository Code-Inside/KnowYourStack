Unfortunately the class does not implement any interface nor has virtual methods.\r\n\r\nSet fallback folders and install path to a disk with slow access. Restoring from it will be slow even if all packages are cached because LocalPackageFileCache try to access the actual files. Still in specific user scenario checking for the actual disk files may be avoid and performance may be improved.\r\n\r\n## Other suggested things\r\n\r\nMaking LocalPackageFileCache methods virtual would be the minimum requirement to give NuGet clients an extension point for optimizations.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n### Sample Project\r\n\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n```"},{"Id":"19744042364","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-01-14T16:54:51","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10800","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add TFM for .NET nanoFramework\" (#10800) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"TFM Component  | Value\r\n---------------|------------------\r\nFriendly name  | netnano\r\nTFI            | .NETnanoFramework\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\n* NuGet needs to able to recognize the TFM for .NET nanoFramework and select assets from a NuGet package into a project that targets .NET nanoFramework.\r\n* NuGet needs to allow creating a NuGet package that includes assets for .NET nanoFramework.\r\n* Normal versioning rules need to apply (e.g. a package can offer assets for multiple versions of the .NET nanoFramework and NuGet will use the largest version that is less or equal to the targeted version).\r\n* Once NuGet knows of the TFM for .NET nanoFramework, the .NET nanoFramework maintainers should be able to ship new versions without having to submit any changes to the NuGet client.\r\n\r\n### Non-Goals\r\n\r\n* NuGet doesn't need to understand any compatibility relationships between .NET nanoFramework and other TFM.\r\n\r\nThe spec is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/208)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1470426335705239557","CreatedAt":"2021-12-13T16:12:12+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Hey friends, 👋\n\nWe just published another proposal to bring machine readable json output for dotnet list package co… https://t.co/iffXek2eSz","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":9,"FavoriteCount":7,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1458922810328371207","CreatedAt":"2021-11-11T22:21:18+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Hi friends 👋\n\nHelp us deliver an amazing target framework filtering package search experience by reviewing our prop… https://t.co/AYWrsHhZcZ","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":13,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1457785562614493192","CreatedAt":"2021-11-08T19:02:17+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🚢 Announcing #NuGet 6.0! \n \n📍 Source mapping\n6️⃣ .NET 6 Support\n🔒 Package Vulnerabilities\n🧑‍🔬 Retry &amp; Backoff Behav… https://t.co/qIK6tRSw87","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":165,"FavoriteCount":61,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1448351779423457281","CreatedAt":"2021-10-13T18:15:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Help us understand your package push workflow! https://t.co/7zALBMJ0xH","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":2,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1438283829102456833","CreatedAt":"2021-09-15T23:29:21+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🙌New feature announcement🙌\n\nMap packages to target sources using Package Source Mapping 🗺️\n\nSecuring your package s… https://t.co/UCSO5dcMpz","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":69,"FavoriteCount":30,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1417880494994198529","CreatedAt":"2021-07-21T16:13:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi will be migrating towards a new multi-CDN infrastructure.

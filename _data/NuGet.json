If that’s the case, is it possible to <a target='_blank' href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference\">migrate to PackageReference</a>? That way, all binding redirects are managed by NuGet at build time, eliminating the need of binding redirects provided in config files.</p>\n\n#### Andrew Stanton on 6/6/2020, 02:37 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n\n#### Nikolche Kolev [MSFT] solved on 6/19/2020, 05:25 PM, 0 votes: \n\n<p>Thank you for filling this issue. This behavior is by design.</p>\n<p>In packages.config NuGet is in charge of managing the binding redirects. Whenever a package change happens, NuGet determines whether a binding redirect is needed. NuGet will only apply the binding redirects when they are deemed necessary.</p>\n<p>A sample that I tried out.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a .NET Framework Class Library (.NET Framework 4.7.2)</li>\n<li>Observe that there is no app.config</li>\n<li>Install the Newtonsoft.Json package, version 12.0.3.</li>\n<li>Observe that there is no app.config.</li>\n<li>Install NuGet.Protocol 5.6.0.</li>\n<li>Because NuGet.Protocol itself depends on Newtonsoft.Json 9.0.1, NuGet decides to add a binding redirect.</li>\n</ol><p>You can consider disabling the NuGet application of binding redirects altogether with a NuGet.Config setting, see <a target='_blank' href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file#bindingredirects-section\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file#bindingredirects-section</a> </p>\n\n#### Andrew Stanton on 6/20/2020, 06:20 PM: \n\n<p><a rel=\"user\" href=\"https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/users/3982/7c949e63-2007-471d-9103-3b5b5c8989eb.html\" nodeid=\"3982\">@Nikolche Kolev [MSFT]</a> - does step 6 include creating an app.config file for a project type that does not make use of this file?</p><p>This behavior creates work churn (have to remember to delete it from the project before checkin) and source control churn (someone forgot to delete it and checked it in) for projects.that cant even use this file. Having to also deal with all of the vspscc and vssscc related churn that nuget creates is already a pain. Adding app.configs just piles on. Reformatting our config files when they didn't need it also piles on (i even offered working code - without condition - to fix that reformatting).<br><br>I hope you understand why I dont think that the intention of the design is to make more work for users by junking up the project files, and why this truly seems like an unintended side effect. I'm asking (again) to please fix some of these unintended side effects that constantly nag in my daily work and steal my time and attention.</p>\n"},{"Id":"12701672299","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T18:37:32","Actor":"dseefeld","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9705","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Invalid Nuget.Build.Tasks.Console package when building from source\" (#9705) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nBuilding Nuget.Build.Tasks.Console in source-build results in invalid contentFiles in the generated package.

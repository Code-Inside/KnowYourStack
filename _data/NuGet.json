I'm basically following up on another recent proposal to extend the installation instruction tabs.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nNUKE provides a `nuke :add-package <package-id> [package-version]` command via our [global tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nuke.globaltool), which allows installing packages to the build project. The command works from any directory of a repository built with NUKE, thus covering more situations compared to the conventional `dotnet add` command. More importantly, though, it automatically determines _how_ a package should be installed, which is either as `PackageReference` (regular libraries) or `PackageDownload` (tool packages). The latter is a great feature (thanks once more @nkolev92), because it allows a build to reference tools without messing with references (implicit `ExcludeAssets`), and works with tools in different versions (`PackageReference` wouldn't allow that even with `ExcludeAssets`).\r\n\r\nWe would like to display this command as installation instructions under a separate \"NUKE\" tab. Today, users naturally use `PackageReference` instead of `PackageDownload`, which often completely breaks the compilation of the build project, and overall _is_ a sub-optimal approach.\r\n\r\n## Listing Criteria\r\n\r\nRegarding if we meet the criteria, here are my comments:\r\n\r\n- Signification adoption in .NET community: currently at 1.2 million downloads\r\n- Actively maintained and updated: the project is continuously maintained for the last 4 years (since its creation), and as mentioned used by a wide range of companies and projects\r\n- Security compliance: We have repeatable builds. Publish signed packages. Have a package prefix reservation. And 2FA for NuGet.org!\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n[NUKE](https://nuke.build) is a build automation system, which is created with the idea to integrate with other .NET tools natively. That means it uses regular C# projects for the build implementation and thus comes with IDE integration out-of-the-box, including navigation, refactoring, and debugging. It is well adopted with almost 1k downloads per day, and many companies and projects actively using and transitioning to it (e.g. OctopusDeploy, JetBrains, AvaloniaUI, ASP.NET Boilerplate, CsvHelper, FluentAssertions, HotChocolate).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe and our users would really appreciate for this proposal to be accepted! 🙏"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"15873048578","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-09T01:25:47","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10742","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add an ENV Variable for Package Signing Verification on .NET 5+ Linux/MAC\" (#10742) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"<!-- Please read the following information before posting the issue. -->\n<!-- If you're having trouble with the NuGet client tools (the Visual Studio extension, NuGet.exe command line tool, etc.), you are in the right place. -->\n<!-- If you're having trouble with the NuGet.org Website, please post in [NuGetGallery issues](http://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery/issues) -->\n\n## Details about Problem\n\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | dotnet.exe):\n\nProduct version: \n\nWorked before?

To work around this, you can temporarily target against .NET Core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Modify CA Certificate Store\r\n\r\nDepending on your Linux distro, you can modify your CA certificate store by taking on an earlier version of your `ca-certificates` package.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the affected version is [nss 3.63+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.63_release_notes). `nss` includes a hard-coded list of trusted CA certificates and therefore can be modified to include and trust the `Verisign Universal Root Certificate Authority` again.\r\n\r\nMany Linux distros can leverage `dpkg-reconfigure` to check for the entry and enable trust for it. As a manual workaround, you may need to remove a `leading !` from the certificate line & update your CA certificates package.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Doing this is considered a bad security practice & should only be done if you understand the security implications of doing so.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nDue to existing issues with the .NET 5 signing verification feature & fallback of timestamp verification, we have decided to revoke this feature for Unix-based systems within .NET 5 SDK. Therefore your experience of using `dotnet restore` will remain largely the same as it was in .NET Core 3.1. Stay tuned for an updated .NET SDK version that will include this change.\r\n\r\n### Stay updated\r\n\r\n- We are continuing to investigate this issue and will let you know more as we find out.\r\n- We will also continue posting updates on [NuGet Status](https://status.nuget.org/) and [@NuGet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuget)."},{"Id":"15596835672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T16:16:18","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/55","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package Namespaces Proposal\" (#55) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Introduction of a feature concept called Package Namespaces which allows a developer to include or exclude package IDs by specifying package namespaces on their package source(s).\r\n\r\n🎉📦Please provide your comments, concerns, and feedback within this PR. 📦🎉\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/10660"},{"Id":"15469893086","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:14:19","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/54","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Custom V2 OData queries will be deprecated March 9th, 2021 \" (#54) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (#37) last year and conducted a dry run of the deprecation to ensure that there are no surprises for users (#40). \r\n\r\nWe will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in March 9, 2021, as detailed in [the blogpost here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/custom-v2-odata-queries-will-be-deprecated-march-9-2021/).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know about your questions or concerns on [this discussion post.](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7423)"},{"Id":"15322501248","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-25T20:01:29","Actor":"chgill-MSFT","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/53","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021\" (#53) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021.

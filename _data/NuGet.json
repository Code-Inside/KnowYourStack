This would greatly improve local library development.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nI regularly find myself working with multiple .NET libraries that reference each other as NuGet packages. When one of those libraries is in development, I often want to test it out in a dependent project on the same machine. Rather than updating the package references in the dependent project, I can just add a `NuGet.Config` to it with a `packageSource` for the local, work-in-progress library. That way, when I build the library, it generates a new .nupkg locally, which my dependent projects pick up with their custom package source.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if somebody clones the dependent project repo and _not_ the library project, this causes NuGet restore to fail. The error is typically `Index was outside the bounds of the array` after displaying the config files in use, or  `error NU1301: The local source '...' doesn't exist.` This occurs whether I use `packageSources` or `fallbackFolderPackages` sections in my NuGet.Configs, and occurs for all NuGet clients (hence my selection above). It would be great to have some way of telling NuGet \"use the package from this local source; if the source isn't there, just get it from the next source\"."},{"Id":"22484321405","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-22T18:33:37","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11908","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"packages.lock.json conflict for two .csproj in same folder\" (#11908) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"If I have two .csproj files in the same directory, that include different subsets of *.cs files, and I enable `RestorePackagesWithLockFile`, the resulting packages.lock.json files will conflict, overwriting each other.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be an easy way to rename one of the conflicting packages.lock.json files by setting an MSBuild property."},{"Id":"22483346996","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-22T17:41:35","Actor":"KirillOsenkov","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11908","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"packages.lock.json conflict for two .csproj in same folder\" (#11908) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"If I have two .csproj files in the same directory, that include different subsets of *.cs files, and I enable `RestorePackagesWithLockFile`, the resulting packages.lock.json files will conflict, overwriting each other.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be an easy way to rename one of the conflicting packages.lock.json files by setting an MSBuild property."},{"Id":"22471254308","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-22T08:19:19","Actor":"v-longmin","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11907","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: The “Update” button is still clickable after installing a package-the latest version with “Packages.config” format in PM UI PM UI \" (#11907) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI\n\n### Product Version\n\nNuGet Client Dev\\6.3.0.104\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\n_No response_\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nRepro steps: \r\n1.

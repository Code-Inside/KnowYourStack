All content in the *unbundled* app creates a 40 MB NuGet package including ~8000 files. This was never a problem, as with 3.5.0 packing the app was quite quick. After upgrading to Visual Studio 2017 and NuGet 4.1.0, our build server started failing on the packaging step since it timeouts after 5 minutes. While trying to reproduce this, I found out that the timeout occurs only when using a `..` relative path for including files.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nPacking the same `.nuspec` file from the command line produces these results:\r\n### NuGet.exe 3.5.0 vs NuGet.exe 4.1.0\r\n```\r\nPS {~\\D\\e\\n\\script> .\\repro.ps1\r\n\r\nWednesday 12.

If so, with which NuGet version:\r\n3.5.0.1938\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n1. Create a new SPA application, using e.g. [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io), that depends on a huge amount of NPM packages that need to be deployed with the application.\r\n2. Create a `.nuspec` file, including all files from for the *unbundled* SPA application using a path starting with `..`. This should include a large amount of small JS files.\r\n3. Pack with NuGet 3.5.0 and 4.1.0 and compare time spent packing.\r\n\r\n## Other suggested things\r\n- Small number of files to pack hides the issue.\r\n- The issue doesn't happen when the include path doesn't start with `..`. That is:\r\n`<file src=\"..\\app\\wwwroot\\**\\*.*\" target=\"\" />` will show the error but with \r\n`<file src=\"wwwroot\\**\\*.*\" target=\"\" />`, I was unable to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nCopy the files in a folder below the `.nuspec` file and include from there.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\nThere's nothing special in the verbose logs, packing succeeds but just takes a lot of time on 4.1.0.\r\n\r\n### Sample Project\r\nThere's a Powershell script (`repro.ps1`)in this package to demonstrate the issue:\r\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!ArvtSAxE-8DWitlqmMKfjzzFB94_Gw\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"15787411304","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T19:11:07","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10715","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Speculative bug] Ensure all code paths work with a download count exceeding int.MaxValue\" (#10715) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"<!-- Please read the following information before posting the issue. -->\r\n<!-- If you're having trouble with the NuGet client tools (the Visual Studio extension, NuGet.exe command line tool, etc.), you are in the right place. -->\r\n<!-- If you're having trouble with the NuGet.org Website, please post in [NuGetGallery issues](http://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery/issues) -->\r\n\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: all\r\nProduct version: latest\r\n\r\n## Repro steps and/or sample project\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8476.

To work around this, you can temporarily target against .NET Core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Modify CA Certificate Store\r\n\r\nDepending on your Linux distro, you can modify your CA certificate store by taking on an earlier version of your `ca-certificates` package.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the affected version is [nss 3.63+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.63_release_notes). `nss` includes a hard-coded list of trusted CA certificates and therefore can be modified to include and trust the `Verisign Universal Root Certificate Authority` again.\r\n\r\nMany Linux distros can leverage `dpkg-reconfigure` to check for the entry and enable trust for it. As a manual workaround, you may need to remove a `leading !` from the certificate line & update your CA certificates package.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Doing this is considered a bad security practice & should only be done if you understand the security implications of doing so.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nDue to existing issues with the .NET 5 signing verification feature & fallback of timestamp verification, we have decided to revoke this feature for Unix-based systems within .NET 5 SDK. Therefore your experience of using `dotnet restore` will remain largely the same as it was in .NET Core 3.1. Stay tuned for an updated .NET SDK version that will include this change.\r\n\r\n### Stay updated\r\n\r\n- We are continuing to investigate this issue and will let you know more as we find out.\r\n- We will also continue posting updates on [NuGet Status](https://status.nuget.org/) and [@NuGet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuget)."},{"Id":"15596835672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T16:16:18","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/55","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package Namespaces Proposal\" (#55) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Introduction of a feature concept called Package Namespaces which allows a developer to include or exclude package IDs by specifying package namespaces on their package source(s).\r\n\r\n🎉📦Please provide your comments, concerns, and feedback within this PR. 📦🎉\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/10660"},{"Id":"15469893086","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:14:19","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/54","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Custom V2 OData queries will be deprecated March 9th, 2021 \" (#54) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (#37) last year and conducted a dry run of the deprecation to ensure that there are no surprises for users (#40). \r\n\r\nWe will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in March 9, 2021, as detailed in [the blogpost here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/custom-v2-odata-queries-will-be-deprecated-march-9-2021/).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know about your questions or concerns on [this discussion post.](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7423)"},{"Id":"15322501248","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-25T20:01:29","Actor":"chgill-MSFT","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/53","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021\" (#53) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021.

This happens only when a package's `ref` folder does not align with its `lib` folder. Usage of the \"ref\" folder is quite low in the NuGet ecosystem at this time (~10K packages out of ~3.1M)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction steps\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/737941/95372612-a155ce00-0890-11eb-87d2-e87605158a60.png)\r\n\r\n1.

Install the `System.Private.ServiceModel` package\r\n1. Build your project. If you use `PackageReference` to reference NuGet packages, your build will fail.

This was correct when only `packages.config` existed, but we need to revisit that logic to reflect `PackageReference`'s behavior.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario above, `System.Private.ServiceModel` has an empty \"refs\" folder, thereby hiding all its types. The `System.ServiceModel.Http` package exposes these types using its \"refs\" folder and by depending on `System.Private.ServiceModel`."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"13772021863","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-10-07T23:22:17","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10116","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Make PM UI's icon display resilient to errors\" (#10116) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"It appears we have had multiple bugs in the past related to icons in PM UI which caused VS to crash: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9696, https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10037\r\n\r\nPM UI should never crash VS. If there's any kind of problem with displaying an icon, NuGet should display the default icon.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the first issue, but the second issue is caused because WPF's implementation of resizing and changing the color pallet of images happens on the Dispatcher (UI) thread, and doesn't catch exceptions. Unhandled exceptions on the UI thread crashes the process. Since this is work that WPF is scheduling on the UI thread, NuGet's not on the call stack, and hence we cannot catch/handle the exception. The Dispatcher.UnhandledException handler does get triggered, but I don't see any way to determine if it was NuGet, or something else, that triggered the image load, and even if we assume it was NuGet, I'm not sure how to determine which image load had the problem when we load multiple images in parallel.\r\n\r\nEven if dotnet/wpf fixes the issue, that will take effect in .NET 6 at the earliest, but VS 2019 runs in .NET Framework 4.7.2 (or 4.8 if that's installed, I guess). The bar to service the .NET Framework is very, very high, so I have no idea if this issue would be approved. Even if it is, customers who haven't installed the patch would continue to crash. We have to decide what machine install states we want to support.\r\n\r\nWe should investigating re-designing our icon loading code so that crashing VS just cannot happen, even for bugs we don't currently know about. Think `catch (Exception e)`, rather than catching specific exceptions, which is normally the recommendation. This won't work for this WPF exception on dispatcher thread issue, so we need to do something in addition to handle that scenario.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if it will work, but maybe we can copy [WPF's code](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/blob/b697746306a695af80a756586cad3f84a62e366c/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Wpf/src/PresentationCore/System/Windows/Media/Imaging/BitmapImage.cs#L303), and add more try-catch blocks.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"13771450287","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-10-07T22:02:54","Actor":"dominoFire","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9386","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nuget acceptance command works wrong!\" (#9386) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"NuGet product used (NuGet.exe | dotnet.exe):\r\n\r\nNuGet version (5.4.0.2):\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe --version (3.1.102):\r\n\r\nOS version (Win10 v1903 (18362.720)):\r\n\r\nWhen I run my dotnet nuget command in console like following:\r\n\r\n`dotnet nuget delete B3.Extensions.Data 1.0.2 -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -k apikey`\r\n\r\nit asks me if I want to continue.\r\n\r\n![e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2901269/78363733-f30d5b00-75c4-11ea-88e0-4fc86767512d.PNG)\r\n\r\nIf I type \"y\", it is cancelling.

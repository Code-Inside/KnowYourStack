And for meta packages it's basically not working at all (check out [NETStandard.Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NETStandard.Library)).\r\n\r\nIf think we want to render the lowest version of a framework that the package is compatible with.

Ideally, the list of frameworks would remain the same between packages but we’d indicate unsupported ones.

issue \"GeneratePathProperty properties should end with a trailing slash\" (#8871) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): `msbuild -t:Restore`\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): `5.5.0-preview.1.6319+ba2a72ac9afd9e7260798a6ad14088297570b350.ba2a72ac9afd9e7260798a6ad14088297570b350`\r\n\r\nWorked before? If so, with which NuGet version: no\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\nWhen a package is referenced with `GeneratePathProperty=\"true\"`, a property based on the package name is created in `.nuget.g.props`. The value of the property is the path to the root of the expanded package on disk.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this looks like\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\" '$(ExcludeRestorePackageImports)' != 'true' \">\r\n    <PkgEnterpriseLibrary_TransientFaultHandling_Core Condition=\" '$(PkgEnterpriseLibrary_TransientFaultHandling_Core)' == '' \">C:\\Users\\raines\\.nuget\\packages\\enterpriselibrary.transientfaulthandling.core\\1.0.0</PkgEnterpriseLibrary_TransientFaultHandling_Core>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally this would **end with a path-separator slash**. That makes it easier to avoid referencing the property with a glob like `$(PkgWhatever)\\**` which expands to `{root of disk}\\**` which causes MSBuild to read every file on the disk, with possibly destructive effects. If the property is undefined `$(PkgWhateverWithTrailingSlash)**` is at least restricted to the project directory.\r\n\r\nVarious properties in common targets follow this convention for this reason.\r\n\r\n## Other suggested things\r\n\r\nAn obvious question is \"should MSBuild allow this?\". It's hard to definitively say \"no\", but we're considering logging and some other options: microsoft/msbuild#3642 microsoft/msbuild#3204\r\n"},{"Id":"21253723606","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-12T18:22:59","Actor":"dominoFire","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11739","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: TestPacManPreviewUpdateWithAllowedVersionsConstraint started failing due to new package version\" (#11739) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nOther/NA\n\n### Product Version\n\nNuGet 6.3.0.10\n\n### Worked before?\n\nYes\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nRun test TestPacManPreviewUpdateWithAllowedVersionsConstraint located at NuGet.Client\\test\\NuGet.Core.Tests\\NuGet.PackageManagement.Test\\NuGetPackageManagerTests.cs\r\n\r\nFew hours ago, version 2.0.0 of Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure was published https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure/\r\n\r\nCurrent test has a packages.config which depends on version 1.0.0 of that package:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\r\n  <packages>\r\n    <package id='Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure' version='1.0.0.0' targetFramework='net45' />\r\n    <package id='Newtonsoft.Json' version='4.5.11' allowedVersions='[4.0,5.0)' targetFramework='net45' />\r\n  </packages> \r\n```\r\n\r\nI am wondering if we either\r\n\r\n1) Add a package range to allow only package versions [1.0.0, 2.0.0)\r\n2) Modify test to run only on test-generated, local packages\r\n\r\nAlso, this test runs on nuget.org V2 protocol. \n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n```shell\nMessage: \r\nAssert.Equal() Failure\r\nExpected: 0\r\nActual:   2\r\n\r\n  Stack Trace: \r\n<TestPacManPreviewUpdateWithAllowedVersionsConstraint>d__80.MoveNext() line 4038\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\nTaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\nTaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\nTaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\nTaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\nTaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\nTaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n```\n"},{"Id":"21235052230","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-12T01:56:00","Actor":"dominoFire","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11738","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: Cannot compile NuGet.Client due to duplicated PackageReference\" (#11738) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nOther/NA\n\n### Product Version\n\nVS Version 17.3.0 Preview 1.0 [32410.47.main], NuGet 6.3.0.10\n\n### Worked before?\n\nYes\n\n### Impact\n\nI'm unable to use this version\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\n1.

I can't consistently repro, but our build fails with the following error:\r\n`error : C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.401\\Sdks\\MSBuild.Sdk.Extras\\Sdk not found. Check that a recent enough .NET Core SDK is installed and/or increase the version specified in global.json.`\r\nshortly after this warning:\r\n`The SDK resolver \"NuGetSdkResolver\" failed to run. The process cannot access the file 'C:\\Users\\cloud-user\\AppData\\Roaming\\NuGet\\nugetorgadd.trk' because it is being used by another process.`\r\n\r\nI've found what I believe to be the relevant code in the NuGet.Client repo under src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Configuration/Settings/Settings.cs:\r\n\r\n```                    appDataSettings = ReadSettings(root, defaultSettingsFilePath);\r\n                    var IsEmptyConfig = !appDataSettings.GetSettingValues(ConfigurationConstants.PackageSources).Any();\r\n\r\n                    if (IsEmptyConfig)\r\n                    {\r\n                        var trackFilePath = Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(defaultSettingsFilePath), NuGetConstants.AddV3TrackFile);\r\n\r\n                        if (!File.Exists(trackFilePath))\r\n                        {\r\n                            File.Create(trackFilePath).Dispose();\r\n                            var defaultPackageSource = new SettingValue(NuGetConstants.FeedName, NuGetConstants.V3FeedUrl, isMachineWide: false);\r\n                            defaultPackageSource.AdditionalData.Add(ConfigurationConstants.ProtocolVersionAttribute, \"3\");\r\n                            appDataSettings.UpdateSections(ConfigurationConstants.PackageSources, new List<SettingValue> { defaultPackageSource });\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code is a bit confusing to me, it looks like under certain conditions, it checks to see if the track file exists, and if it doesn't, creates it, but leaves it empty.  Can anyone shed more light on what the track file is and what's happening here?  Additional questions that would be great if anyone has comments on them:\r\n\r\n- Any possible cause or solution to my problem\r\n- Since this occurs in an else block, would it be possible to bypass this code path somehow?\r\n- Any recommendations on how to debug into this?  Would be interested to know if this is ever being hit normally and if not, why not\r\n\r\nI believe all of the bits that are being run ship with Visual Studio, currently on version 15.8.4\r\n\r\nEDIT: Am wondering, would it be possible to work around this by placing a track file with the expected contents in that location?  Is there any way to figure out what the expected contents would be?"},{"Id":"20457592307","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-25T17:51:05","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11622","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"VS PMUI is ignoring cancellation exception\" (#11622) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Follow up on [comment](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4471/files#r814926714).

dotnet CLI should return a meaningful error message as to what the problem is\r\n\r\nIn the scenario where nothing is wrong and the dotnet CLI fails for no reason, the expected behavior would be for the restore task to complete successfully as it does in other builds of the same codebase at previous times.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`dotnet restore` fails with `TaskCanceledException` and no indication as to what the issue is.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[13:07:51]\t[Step 2/2] .NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n[13:07:51]\t[Step 2/2]

To centralize blob storage access code this change makes them use `ICloudBlobClient`.\r\n\r\nDuplicated code that switches between the primary and alternate source for stats was removed from individual services and moved into DI container. A registration of `ICloudBlobClient` keyed as `BindingKeys.FeatureFlaggedStatisticsKey` resolves to a blob client that points to the proper storage account. Services are supposed to request `Func<ICloudBlobClient>` from the DI container that will provide proper client on each individual call.\r\n\r\nA `SimpleCloudBlobExtensions` class was introduced to close the gap between `CloudBlockBlobReference` class provided by the storage SDK and `CloudBlobWrapper` in our code (specifically, our wrapper lacks equivalent of `DownloadTextAsync`). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, report services did a `.ExistAsync()` checks before accessing the blob contents, causing unnecessary network round trip. More helpers were added to `SimpleCloudBlobExtensions` to handle missing blobs gracefully on content retrieval instead, saving one HTTP request on each report content access.\r\n\r\nLastly, `CloudDownloadCountService` was made async to accommodate for async-only `ISimpleCloudBlob`."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"15887158054","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-10T01:00:12","Actor":"jebriede","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10761","RelatedDescription":"Opened

To work around this, you can temporarily target against .NET Core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Modify CA Certificate Store\r\n\r\nDepending on your Linux distro, you can modify your CA certificate store by taking on an earlier version of your `ca-certificates` package.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the affected version is [nss 3.63+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.63_release_notes). `nss` includes a hard-coded list of trusted CA certificates and therefore can be modified to include and trust the `Verisign Universal Root Certificate Authority` again.\r\n\r\nMany Linux distros can leverage `dpkg-reconfigure` to check for the entry and enable trust for it. As a manual workaround, you may need to remove a `leading !` from the certificate line & update your CA certificates package.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Doing this is considered a bad security practice & should only be done if you understand the security implications of doing so.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nDue to existing issues with the .NET 5 signing verification feature & fallback of timestamp verification, we have decided to revoke this feature for Unix-based systems within .NET 5 SDK. Therefore your experience of using `dotnet restore` will remain largely the same as it was in .NET Core 3.1. Stay tuned for an updated .NET SDK version that will include this change.\r\n\r\n### Stay updated\r\n\r\n- We are continuing to investigate this issue and will let you know more as we find out.\r\n- We will also continue posting updates on [NuGet Status](https://status.nuget.org/) and [@NuGet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuget)."},{"Id":"15596835672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T16:16:18","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/55","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package Namespaces Proposal\" (#55) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Introduction of a feature concept called Package Namespaces which allows a developer to include or exclude package IDs by specifying package namespaces on their package source(s).\r\n\r\n🎉📦Please provide your comments, concerns, and feedback within this PR. 📦🎉\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/10660"},{"Id":"15469893086","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:14:19","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/54","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Custom V2 OData queries will be deprecated March 9th, 2021 \" (#54) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (#37) last year and conducted a dry run of the deprecation to ensure that there are no surprises for users (#40). \r\n\r\nWe will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in March 9, 2021, as detailed in [the blogpost here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/custom-v2-odata-queries-will-be-deprecated-march-9-2021/).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know about your questions or concerns on [this discussion post.](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7423)"},{"Id":"15322501248","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-25T20:01:29","Actor":"chgill-MSFT","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/53","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021\" (#53) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021.

For example, see: https://azuresearch-usnc.nuget.org/query?q=packageid:newtonsoft.json&prerelease=true&semVerLevel=2.0.0\r\n\r\nThe NuGet.Protocol library has a [`PackageSearchMetadata.GetVersionsAsync()`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/9173d9bc53b5123d5cadec6cae513149d40505b0/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/Model/PackageSearchMetadata.cs#L197) method that returns `VersionInfo`s, which have a [`DownloadCount`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/9173d9bc53b5123d5cadec6cae513149d40505b0/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/Model/VersionInfo.cs#L34) property.

I can only provide information about what the client sees, but when we use the v3 protocol the server responds with no error for missing packages.  It returns this:\r\n\r\n```{\"count\":1,\"items\":[{\"count\":0,\"items\":[],\"parent\":\"http://private.server/nuget/feed/v3/registrations-gz/robblerobble/index.json\",\"lower\":null,\"upper\":null}]}```\r\n\r\nwhen querying for the bogus package \"robblerobble\".  This causes the NuGet command to throw an exception when installing any package that is not hosted on the private server, because it tries to parse the upper and lower version strings.  Because of this error, NuGet.exe will not continue and try to install the package from the next repository in the list.\r\n\r\nI realise this could be dismissed as a problem with the server, but it can also easily be worked around in the client, and since I do not run the server, I cannot log a meaningful support incident about that side of the problem.

It has some different apis in netstandard than net47.\n\nI want to generate a nupkg which should be usable from both .net specific framework and .net coreclr projects. So, if someone creates a fullframework net46/net47 project Or coreclr project targeting netcoreapp2.0 or net47, it should pick up dll based on its version. Also, for .net standard, since it targets multiple platform, I have `Linux` and `win` specific dll.\n\nHow should I structure my nupkg so that during compilation and packaging, it takes the right dll ?\n\nI have the following structure of nupkg :\n\n```\nmy_lib.NUPKG\n|   my_lib.nuspec\n|   [Content_Types].xml\n|\n+---lib\n|   \\---net45\n|           my_lib.dll\n|           my_lib.xml\n|\n+---package\n|   \\---services\n|       \\---metadata\n|           \\---core-properties\n|                   f173822ccbd74dfb9a5338af5508d1b6.psmdcp\n|\n+---ref\n|   \\---netstandard2.0\n|           my_lib.dll\n|\n+---runtimes\n|   +---linux\n|   |   \\---lib\n|   |       \\---netstandard2.0\n|   |               my_lib.dll\n|   |\n|   \\---win\n|       \\---lib\n|           +---net461\n|           |       my_lib.dll\n|           |\n|           +---net462\n|           |       my_lib.dll\n|           |\n|           +---net47\n|           |       my_lib.dll\n|           |\n|           +---net471\n|           |       my_lib.dll\n|           |\n|           \\---netstandard2.0\n|                   my_lib.dll  // this is different from above my_lib.dll\n|\n\\---_rels\n        .rels\n\n```\n\nThis is working for most cases.\n\nHowever, when user creates a .net sdk coreclr project targeting net471 using dotnet cli :\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <TargetFramework>net47</TargetFramework>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\nduring compilation, it refers to netstandard2.0 dll and fails to compile. If I comment out the incompatible apis, in the generated build, it has right net47 `my_lib.dll`. This means that during compilation `only`, it is referring to netstandard2.0 dll.  \n\nI think that their might be something wrong with how I have structured my nupkg.\nWhat is the right way for this ? Can you point me to some documentation around this ?\n\n## Details about Problem\n\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe):\n\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): \n```\nNuGet.exe help\nNuGet Version: 3.4.3.855\n```\n\ndotnet.exe --version (if appropriate):\n```\n.NET Command Line Tools (2.0.3)\n\nProduct Information:\n Version:            2.0.3\n Commit SHA-1 hash:  12f0c7efcc\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.16299\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.0.3\\\n\nMicrosoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\n\n  Version  : 2.0.3\n  Build    : a9190d4a75f4a982ae4b4fa8d1a24526566c69df\n```\nVS version (if appropriate): `15.4.5`\n\nOS version : `win 10 enterprise v1709 16299.309`\n\n\n\n---\n#### Document Details\n\n⚠ *Do not edit this section.

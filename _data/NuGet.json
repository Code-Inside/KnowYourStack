With each package, there is metadata & package contents that are used to help define the overall package.\r\n\r\nA high quality or \"healthy\" package is one that follows the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n- **It is actively maintained.** Either with recent commits or an annual update/notice that the package is up-to-date.\r\n- **It is documented.** It provides enough documentation to install, get started, and has public API documentation on it's members.\r\n- **It has a way to report bugs.** It provides a centralized location or repository in which issues are regularly triaged & resolved in future releases.\r\n- **It resolves security flaws quickly.** It fixes known vulnerabilities & releases an unaffected release quickly.\r\n- **It is not deprecated.** It is in an active state meeting all the criteria above.\r\n\r\nThis is a small list of the many different characteristics that may make a package of high quality or \"healthy\".\r\n\r\nHaving packages of high quality that depend on other packages of high quality will make the overall software supply chain of higher quality and thus more secure & reliable for those using .NET tooling.\r\n\r\nThis proposal introduces the concept known as Package Scoring or NET Score for short.\r\n\r\nTL;DR packages have a combined score of four categories that helps developers make trust decisions. Those categories might be:\r\n\r\n- Popularity- How popular a package is & recognized in the ecosystem.\r\n- Quality - The completeness of a package following best practices & providing documentation.\r\n- Maintenance - The state of maintenance & free of security vulnerabilities.\r\n- Community - The sustainability of an active community for the package.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/216\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"19952662338","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-01-27T19:18:23","Actor":"clairernovotny","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8963","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Incorrect link on NuGet TOU page\" (#8963) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"The NuGet TOU page (https://www.nuget.org/policies/Terms) and noticed that the link in the “Your Privacy” section to the Microsoft Privacy Statement is wrong.

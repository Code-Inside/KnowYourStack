During this time, the hard drive is also more or less frozen and incapable of normal operation (very slow reading/getting stuck/taking forever to show folder or drive contents).\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | Visual Studio | MSBuild.exe | dotnet.exe): Visual Studio\r\n\r\nProduct version: 2019 Community, latest update\r\n\r\nWorked before?

I imagine the USB docking station simply doesn't have the bandwidth to deal with a lot of simultaneous IO requests. Nuget is absolutely bombarding it with those though, from what it seems. I tried moving the \"packages\" folder from the solution to an internal SSD and linking it via junction and the problem disappeared completely. So it's about IO requests within the packages folder, and the problem occurs already at a relatively low count of packages, 12 in my case.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\nDon't have these because I already got the solution via my SSD and I don't feel like torturing my hard drive any more. But it always ends up failing due to this: \"The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error.\" This happens after the \"Adding package to ... /packages\" step and there's tens of seconds in between where the GUI and the hard drive freezes. It then ends up rolling back the installation. Strangely enough it does seem to succeed putting the files in the appropriate packages subfolder, but then removes them again after it fails.\r\n<!-- Please include verbose logs (NuGet.exe <COMMAND> -verbosity detailed | dotnet.exe <COMMAND> --verbosity diag | etc...) -->\r\n"},{"Id":"16162001591","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-30T22:20:12","Actor":"jebriede","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10779","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tools -> Options -> NuGet Package Manager string is truncated\" (#10779) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Related to: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1151266\n\nAffected Branch:\nAffected Build: Version 16.7.0 Preview 4.0 [30301.268.master]\nAffected Product Language:\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. open tools->options->NuGet Package Manager\n2. observe the string in the label for \"Automatically check for missing packages during build in Visual\n\n\n**Expected**\nthe string should either end with \"in Visual Basic\" or with \"during build.\"\n\n**Observed**\nthe string appears trunctated, and has extraneous information (\"in Visual\").

This certificate is used to verify the content integrity of a package and protect against content tampering. When the signing certificate expires, it will fallback to a timestamp for verification.\r\n\r\nFor packages that have not been automatically re-signed by NuGet.org with an updated certificate, you may be affected by [.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions using NSS or ca-certificates](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56). Only a subset of NuGet.org packages have been re-signed with a new certificate since March 15th, 2021.\r\n\r\nGiven that the [NuGet Microsoft author signing certificate has already expired](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/microsoft-author-signing-certificate-update/), you may have already ran into this issue if you have a Microsoft author signed package in your environment and may already be aware of this change in behavior & resolved it.\r\n\r\nFor reference of the different types of NuGet signatures:\r\n\r\n- **Author signature.** An author signature guarantees that the package has not been modified since the author signed the package, no matter from which repository or what transport method the package is delivered. Additionally, author-signed packages provide an extra authentication mechanism to the nuget.org publishing pipeline because the signing certificate must be registered ahead of time. \r\n- **Repository signature.** Repository signatures provide an integrity guarantee for all packages in a repository whether they are author signed or not, even if those packages are obtained from a different location than the original repository where they were signed.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nYour Linux environment may give you error messages when running `dotnet restore` such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror NU3028: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The author primary signature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: self signed certificate in certificate chain\r\n\r\nerror NU3037: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The author primary signature validity period has expired.\r\n\r\nerror NU3028: Package 'System.Memory 4.5.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository countersignature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: self signed certificate in certificate chain\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis indicates that your environment is affected by an upstream change to [nss](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/) or `ca-certificates` packages and you'll need to update your .NET SDK to resolve it.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds have been provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you update to these builds as soon as you can to mitigate disruption on Linux environments.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nFor more details on this incident, see the following resources:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56\r\n- https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/net-5-nuget-restore-failures-on-linux-distributions-using-nss-or-ca-certificates/\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180\r\n\r\nIf you run into this issue after April 14th, 2021, please provide a comment on https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712"},{"Id":"15789095683","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-01T22:00:20","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/57","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet.org temporarily down due to Azure services outage\" (#57) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"NuGet.org is being affected by an outage due to issues affecting the Azure Portal and Azure services, but the team is on it.

To work around this, you can temporarily target against .NET Core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Modify CA Certificate Store\r\n\r\nDepending on your Linux distro, you can modify your CA certificate store by taking on an earlier version of your `ca-certificates` package.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the affected version is [nss 3.63+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.63_release_notes). `nss` includes a hard-coded list of trusted CA certificates and therefore can be modified to include and trust the `Verisign Universal Root Certificate Authority` again.\r\n\r\nMany Linux distros can leverage `dpkg-reconfigure` to check for the entry and enable trust for it. As a manual workaround, you may need to remove a `leading !` from the certificate line & update your CA certificates package.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Doing this is considered a bad security practice & should only be done if you understand the security implications of doing so.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nDue to existing issues with the .NET 5 signing verification feature & fallback of timestamp verification, we have decided to revoke this feature for Unix-based systems within .NET 5 SDK. Therefore your experience of using `dotnet restore` will remain largely the same as it was in .NET Core 3.1.

The full project is [XAMLTest](https://github.com/Keboo/XAMLTest), but I have created a smaller [sample project](https://github.com/Keboo/PackIssue) the reproduces the issue as well. In order to get the targets files into the needed `build\\<tfm>` directory I have been using the [TfmSpecificPackageFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#targetsfortfmspecificcontentinpackage) extensibility to inject the targets files. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the repository I have included a global.json file for switching between 5.0.100 and 5.0.201. The following steps work under 5.0.100, but throw a NU1012 when run with 5.0.201\r\n\r\n1. Set .NET version in global.json\r\n2. Run dotnet pack\r\n\r\nWith 5.0.100 a NuGet package is generated with the targets file placed within build\\<tfm>\\.\r\nWith 5.0.201 I received the error\r\n>  C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.201\\Sdks\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack\\build\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets(221,5): error NU1012: Some included files are included under TFMs which are missing a platform version: net5.0-windows [D:\\Dev\\PackIssue\\PackIssue\\PackIssue.csproj]\r\n\r\nI have attempted to determine how to properly set the \"platform version\" that it cares about, but have been unable to find the needed configuration value to set. Perhaps it is as simple as knowing the needed configuration?\r\nThe issue only reproduces when using `net5.0-windows` removing the `-windows` allows for the package to be built successfully as well. However, since my goal is to distrubte a WPF package this is not a viable solution for me as I need to set `<UseWPF>true</USeWPF>`.\r\nIn my XAMLTest project, I am able to use the same `TfmSpecificPackageFile` extensibility with `.exe` and `.json` files without an error on both 5.0.100 and 5.0.201. \r\n\r\n[VerboseLog.txt](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/6259457/VerboseLog.txt)\r\n"},{"Id":"15826408410","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-06T07:23:18","Actor":"wouterroos","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10701","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \".nupkg.metadata missing when executing 'nuget add -Expand' from  Azure DevOps MSBuild task\" (#10701) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"<!-- Please read the following information before posting the issue. -->\r\n<!-- If you're having trouble with the NuGet client tools (the Visual Studio extension, NuGet.exe command line tool, etc.), you are in the right place. -->\r\n<!-- If you're having trouble with the NuGet.org Website, please post in [NuGetGallery issues](http://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery/issues) -->\r\n\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | MSBuild.exe):\r\n\r\nProduct version: 4.7.1, 5.8.1, 5.9.0\r\n\r\n## Repro steps and/or sample project\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nWe're using the -Expand option in a MSBuild task to publish newly generated NuGet packages to a local fallback folder (see below).\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Target Name=\"PublishLocalNugetPackage\" AfterTargets=\"Pack;DeleteExistingLocalNuGetPackage\">                \r\n  <Exec Command=\"nuget add $(PackageOutputPath)$(PackageId).$(Version).nupkg -Expand -Source $(LocalNugetFeedPath) -Verbosity detailed\"/>\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works beautifully when invoking MSBuild from the command line.

To work around this, you can temporarily target against .NET Core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Modify CA Certificate Store\r\n\r\nDepending on your Linux distro, you can modify your CA certificate store by taking on an earlier version of your `ca-certificates` package.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the affected version is [nss 3.63+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.63_release_notes). `nss` includes a hard-coded list of trusted CA certificates and therefore can be modified to include and trust the `Verisign Universal Root Certificate Authority` again.\r\n\r\nMany Linux distros can leverage `dpkg-reconfigure` to check for the entry and enable trust for it. As a manual workaround, you may need to remove a `leading !` from the certificate line & update your CA certificates package.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Doing this is considered a bad security practice & should only be done if you understand the security implications of doing so.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nDue to existing issues with the .NET 5 signing verification feature & fallback of timestamp verification, we have decided to revoke this feature for Unix-based systems within .NET 5 SDK. Therefore your experience of using `dotnet restore` will remain largely the same as it was in .NET Core 3.1. Stay tuned for an updated .NET SDK version that will include this change.\r\n\r\n### Stay updated\r\n\r\n- We are continuing to investigate this issue and will let you know more as we find out.\r\n- We will also continue posting updates on [NuGet Status](https://status.nuget.org/) and [@NuGet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuget)."},{"Id":"15596835672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T16:16:18","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/55","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package Namespaces Proposal\" (#55) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Introduction of a feature concept called Package Namespaces which allows a developer to include or exclude package IDs by specifying package namespaces on their package source(s).\r\n\r\n🎉📦Please provide your comments, concerns, and feedback within this PR. 📦🎉\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/10660"},{"Id":"15469893086","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:14:19","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/54","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Custom V2 OData queries will be deprecated March 9th, 2021 \" (#54) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (#37) last year and conducted a dry run of the deprecation to ensure that there are no surprises for users (#40). \r\n\r\nWe will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in March 9, 2021, as detailed in [the blogpost here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/custom-v2-odata-queries-will-be-deprecated-march-9-2021/).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know about your questions or concerns on [this discussion post.](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7423)"},{"Id":"15322501248","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-25T20:01:29","Actor":"chgill-MSFT","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/53","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021\" (#53) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The current NuGet.org repository signing certificate will be updated as soon as March 15th, 2021.

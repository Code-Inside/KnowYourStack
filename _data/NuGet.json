That's a separate issue, and particularly problematic for content-only packages.\r\n\r\nThe bug here is that when using `dotnet nuget push` to upload a release of multiple packages in a solution, `dotnet nuget push` will leave the release in a half-uploaded state if anything, however minor, goes wrong. This is not nice behavior, especially since we use CI nowadays.  Broken package sets/trees are a big problem.\r\n\r\nI don't care if my empty symbol package [fails to upload](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/runs/8022213904?check_suite_focus=true), but I do care that I now have a blend of packages on NuGet.org referencing versions that don't even exist thanks to this behavior. \r\n\r\nCan we have \"--ignore-errors=true\" flag, please?\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet nuget push uploading\\*.nupkg --skip-duplicate --api-key ***  --source nuget.org\r\n[...]\r\nPushing ImageResizer.WebConfig.5.0.2-preview03.snupkg to 'https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/symbolpackage'...\r\n  PUT https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/symbolpackage/\r\n  BadRequest https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/symbolpackage/ 179ms\r\nerror: Response status code does not indicate success: 400 (The package does not contain any symbol (.pdb) files.).\r\n[FAILS]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"22334696634","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-14T17:23:29","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/62","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE 2022-30184 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability\" (#62) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-30184 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0 and .NET Core 3.1, NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.Commands, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.CommandLine.XPlat version range from 3.5.0 to 6.2.0).

While the general mechanism to refresh secrets is introduced, I did *not* go through all DI container registrations to make sure we don't have other singletons holding on to old secrets. The goal was to make storage secrets rotate at this moment.\r\n\r\nThe problem with secret refresh in Gallery has several reasons:\r\n* We have too many singletons that inject secrets once at their creation, then hold on to those injected values;\r\n* The `AppConfiguration` object is expensive to create (and we need one for every request we get) as it might try to read secrets from KeyVault, so it was registered in DI container as a singleton as well, so there was no way to retrieve fresh set of credentials.\r\n\r\nTo address the latter concern a [change](https://github.com/NuGet/ServerCommon/pull/363) in ServerCommon was made that introduces the sync secret injection with refresh in background task. Now, `ConfigurationService` during startup enumerates all the secrets Gallery uses, feeds them into the sync secret reader to start the background refresh loop. Now, injecting secret is a sync operation that never does any I/O. The downside here is that if we don't discover all secrets during startup, the injection of those missed secrets will fail at run time. To mitigate that a self-healing mechanism was added to the sync reader that would add those new secrets to the refresh list, so while the initial attempts to inject those would fail, it should eventually start working. Sync reader emits a metric if it runs into such situation, we'll have an alert for that.\r\n\r\nThe process of enumerating all secrets got a bit complicated since Authentication-related settings had their own mechanism of reading secrets.\r\n\r\nThe next major change was making sure storage-related registrations are not singletons. There were a few issues with those:\r\n* Object themselves once constructed hold on to resolved secrets forever;\r\n* Object factories in `ConfigureForAzureStorage` used a single instance of `AppConfiguration` to create new instances;\r\n* Some of storage-related objects have to be singletons.\r\n\r\n`EditableFeatureFlagFileStorageService` and `ContentService` have some caching mechanisms inside, which requires them to be a singleton. One option to solve it would be to extract the caching functionality into a separate class that would not have anything to do with underlying storage, but that would be quite complicated change, instead, instances of those classes now get storage service factories, instantiate individual services as needed and discard them right after that. Some DI registrations had to be updated to make sure they receive properly keyed factories.\r\n\r\n`GalleryMachineKeyConfigurationProvider` was updated to not to try to create configuration for itself if it is not available. Now it waits until `ConfigurationService` is properly initialized.\r\n\r\nSince the new sync secret reader emits metrics, we now need to set up telemetry service before the configuration service is fully initialized, so some workarounds had to be added there (specifically, to prevent attempting to inject secrets to telemetry-related options, since those don't contain secrets).\r\n\r\n`_configurationTypes` field was added to `ConfigurationService` to unify the way various types of configuration are crated and to make sure the secret enumeration for the new sync reader has a reliable source of data.\r\n\r\nTo test the change connection string hash logging was added to `CloudBlobClientWrapper` at the point of use (not instantiation),  to verify the refresh actually happens and secret refresh interval was reduced to 15 minutes. Since we are reading SAS tokens generated by KeyVault, they effectively change every second (issue time is precise to the second in it), which provides a good opportunity to verify they are not reused longer than expected. After running for couple of nights in dev and few bugfixes, logs indicate that secrets are indeed refreshed every 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some of our unit tests assume that `ConfigurationService.Current` always returns the same object, so some workaround was added to `TestGalleryConfigurationService` to make them pass."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"19044968103","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-25T06:08:55","Actor":"MGBtrust","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11414","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"MGBTRUST NuGet\" (#11414) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"*"},{"Id":"19044966634","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-25T06:08:46","Actor":"MGBtrust","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11414","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"MGBTRUST NuGet\" (#11414) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"*"},{"Id":"19042128320","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-24T23:56:27","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11090","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Reduce UI thread switching when determining solution folder and if solution is open\" (#11090) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"NuGet's Visual Studio extension has a class named `VsSolutionManager`, which provides some APIs to the rest of our code. Two of these APIs, `SolutionDirectory` and `IsSolutionOpenAsync` switch to the UI thread.\r\n\r\nIn at least one of the code paths, `IsSolutionOpenAsync` is called from a background thread, therefore switches to the UI thread, and returns it's value. This causes the caller to schedule its continuation on the background thread, but it then immediately calls another API that switches to the UI thread again.  This adds latency to the customer experience. While switching to the UI thread in the caller will remove the bouncing between threads, code running on the UI thread prevents other code from using the UI thread until our code finishes running. Therefore removing the need for the UI thread is preferable.\r\n\r\nSolutionDirectory can be obtained once, and cached, eliminating the need to switch to the UI thread every time the directory is needed.\r\n\r\nThis class already listens to solution events, so IsSolutionOpenAsync can cache the last known state change."},{"Id":"19041393207","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-24T22:23:48","Actor":"kartheekp-ms","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11409","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Reduce heap allocations in ResolverUtility.FindLibraryByVersionAsync\" (#11409) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"@kartheekp-ms commented on [Tue Nov 23 2021](https://github.com/NuGet/Client.Engineering/issues/1314)\n\nWhile working on https://github.com/nuget/client.engineering/issues/1057 issue, I noticed that `ResolverUtility.FindLibraryByVersionAsync` method https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/a8b6b1fb3a1bccd207a83612cd0f5e1f4ff1d0b8/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core/ResolverUtility.cs#L363 has following warnings reported by the `PerformanceSensitive` analyzers.\r\n\r\nSeverity | Code | Description | Project | File | Line | Suppression State\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nWarning | HAA0302 | The compiler will emit a class that will hold this as a field to allow   capturing of this closure | NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core (net472) | ~\\NuGet.Client-W1\\src\\NuGet.Core\\NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core\\ResolverUtility.cs | 365 | Active\r\nWarning | HAA0301 | Heap allocation of closure Captures:   libraryRange,framework,cacheContext,logger,token | NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core (net472) | ~\\NuGet.Client-W1\\src\\NuGet.Core\\NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core\\ResolverUtility.cs | 373 | Active\r\nWarning | HAA0302 | The compiler will emit a class that will hold this as a field to allow   capturing of this closure | NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core (net472) | ~\\NuGet.Client-W1\\src\\NuGet.Core\\NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core\\ResolverUtility.cs | 423 | Active\r\n\r\nThis method has ~880 MB allocations during solution restore for OrchardCore solution https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/tree/75923732c36d2785cb869affb805f0ff19d1847c\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52756182/143098452-39101c02-b521-4410-89a1-e4c76b4eeed3.png)\n\n"},{"Id":"19039254142","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-24T19:08:56","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11413","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: Package Source Mapping matches found should not be logged for projects!\" (#11413) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe, MSBuild.exe, NuGet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.0\n\n### Worked before?\n\nNo\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

Extension authors may be confused, particularly if they don't check `Version.TryParse`'s return value.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nMark affected APIs with `ObsoleteAttribute`, so extension authors are made aware they should use a different API where version is a string instead.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1458922810328371207","CreatedAt":"2021-11-11T22:21:18+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Hi friends 👋\n\nHelp us deliver an amazing target framework filtering package search experience by reviewing our prop… https://t.co/AYWrsHhZcZ","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":12,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1457785562614493192","CreatedAt":"2021-11-08T19:02:17+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🚢 Announcing #NuGet 6.0! \n \n📍 Source mapping\n6️⃣ .NET 6 Support\n🔒 Package Vulnerabilities\n🧑‍🔬 Retry &amp; Backoff Behav… https://t.co/qIK6tRSw87","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":164,"FavoriteCount":61,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1448351779423457281","CreatedAt":"2021-10-13T18:15:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Help us understand your package push workflow! https://t.co/7zALBMJ0xH","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":1,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1438283829102456833","CreatedAt":"2021-09-15T23:29:21+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🙌New feature announcement🙌\n\nMap packages to target sources using Package Source Mapping 🗺️\n\nSecuring your package s… https://t.co/UCSO5dcMpz","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":68,"FavoriteCount":30,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1417880494994198529","CreatedAt":"2021-07-21T16:13:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi will be migrating towards a new multi-CDN infrastructure.

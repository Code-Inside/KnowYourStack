Please describe.\r\nI'm new to maintaining the Apache log4net project and on the mailing list, I've read that issues are being reported via the email address that surfaces on nuget.org. This means that:\r\n- a person has to read that mail\r\n- that person must marshal that mail\r\n- that person is very likely not a log4net developer\r\n- eventually, that mail should end up becoming an issue that is tracked & resolved somewhere.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like people to raise issues via GitHub so that there's an open dialog and it's easy to track instead of via the email route.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nnpmjs.com makes this easy by surfacing an issues url configured via package.json right on the package page. I'd like to propose the same idea for nuspec files: an optional <issuesUrl> tag which, if present, would be surfaced on nuget.org. Yes, a person can eventually get to the issues page via the project page, but a direct link would probably help people to marshal their issues effectively.\r\n\r\nnpmjs.com also surfaces the issue count here -- that's a \"nice to have\", but a direct link to being able to post an issue would be a real win, imo.\r\n\r\nIn this screen snip, I had the cursor hovered over the issue count so that you can see that it's a link with the url shown at the bottom of the Firefox window:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4669340/92690558-7e8fd280-f341-11ea-97e7-ba755542f45a.png)\r\n"},{"Id":"13466141413","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-09T22:14:45","Actor":"lyndaidaii","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8202","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[ReleasePrep][2020.09.09]RI of dev into master for NuGetGallery\" (#8202) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"13434389360","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-07T11:17:42","Actor":"Sergio0694","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8201","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Poor/unrelated search results when not using the exact package name\" (#8201) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Describe the bug\r\nSearching for the [`Microsoft.Toolkit.HighPerformance` package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Toolkit.HighPerformance/) displays unrelated search results.

Alternatively I suppose we can simply define the overrides in the nearer one and then <Import> the original one, since given the behavior you said it has, the subsequent ones that conflict will be ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"27319677688","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-02-24T18:37:34","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12229","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: Disable the Update/Install button for floating versions in CPM in PMUI\" (#12229) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"CPM doesn't allow the usage of Floating Versions, disable this in the PM UI "},{"Id":"27319463723","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-02-24T18:25:52","Actor":"jeffkl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12285","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CPM opt in detection in VS and commandline is different\" (#12285) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"1. dotnet new classlib\r\n1.

This would be the project would fail on the commandline as well.\r\n- set the ManagePackageVersionsCentrally property to true if and only if, the prop value is true and the file was imported.

This change allows our team flexibility to switch to a back-up provider in the case that one CDN is down, which will broaden coverage for our users.\r\n\r\nSome changes are coming for older TLS cipher suites, which may result in connectivity issues. From our data we believe this will affect only a small percentage of requests. We will be monitoring all feedback channels during the migration to assess impact and adjust our roll-out timeline as needed.\r\n\r\nBelow, we provide resources to determine whether you will be affected by this change.

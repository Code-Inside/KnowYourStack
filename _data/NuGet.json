Because of that, your application receives the transitive NETStandard.Library/1.6.1 package dependency which itself brings in a ton other framework dependencies and some of these might even have a known vulnerability (i.e. System.Runtime/4.3.0).\r\n\r\nTo minimize the dependency graph and not bring these out-of-support and vulnerable dependencies into the closure, we define a PackageReference to NETStandard.Library/2.0.3 which results in it being preferred over the transitive NETStandard.Library/1.6.1 package and a trimmed dependency graph (NETStandard.Library/2.0.3 has a single dependency only).\r\n\r\nThis is achieved via the following: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/ba0d5f41c25357e375927bab28ce268262bf22ca/eng/testing/xunit/xunit.targets#L3-L6\r\n\r\nNow with CPM enabled, implicitly referenced packages can't be bumped anymore as the unsuppressable `NU1009` error is raised. The alternative of disabling CPM is not possible as that affects every project that has a (transitive or direct) package dependency on NETStandard.Library/1.6.1. These days such projects are mostly test projects in our stack which use xunit or Shouldly but those are hundreds in runtime and still a lot in msbuild.\r\n\r\nCPM should warn about such cases but not error or offer a way to suppress it. As an alternative, to provide a work around for similar issues that might arise in the future, it might help to allow specifying the `VersionOverride` attribute on the PackageReference item without a corresponding `PackageVersion` item.\r\n\r\ncc @jeffkl "},{"Id":"28571987027","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-21T08:48:36","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12289","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Warn when vulnerabilities are detected during PackageReference restore \" (#12289) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"28561164699","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-20T20:09:56","Actor":"dtivel","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11262","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Signing:  re-enable signed package verification on Linux and macOS\" (#11262) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"[Design specification](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/signed-package-verification/re-enable-signed-package-verification.md)\r\n[Technical specification](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/signed-package-verification/re-enable-signed-package-verification-technical.md)"},{"Id":"28557384426","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-20T17:06:06","Actor":"martinrrm","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12547","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Screen readers not detecting elements in NuGet Solver window\" (#12547) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"27557007112","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-07T18:44:23","Actor":"dnfadmin","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/68","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Moving to the new .NET Foundation CLA service\" (#68) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hello everyone\r\nThe .NET Foundation is transitioning to a new CLA service and I'm posting here to let you know it's happening.

This change allows our team flexibility to switch to a back-up provider in the case that one CDN is down, which will broaden coverage for our users.\r\n\r\nSome changes are coming for older TLS cipher suites, which may result in connectivity issues. From our data we believe this will affect only a small percentage of requests. We will be monitoring all feedback channels during the migration to assess impact and adjust our roll-out timeline as needed.\r\n\r\nBelow, we provide resources to determine whether you will be affected by this change. This utilizes the [.NET CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to install a package from our pre-production (INT) environment which tests connectivity:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir cdn-test\r\ncd cdn-test\r\ndotnet new classlib\r\ndotnet add package BaseTestPackage.NetStandard --source https://apiint.nugettest.org/v3/index.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing connectivity issues while connecting to nuget.org or restoring packages from https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json, such as:\r\n\r\n\"The SSL connection could not be established\"\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that TLS 1.2 and any of the following cipher suites have been enabled on your machine:\r\n\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, do reach out to us at support@nuget.org or by commenting on the discussion issue: NuGet/Home#11058"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1631370937248481281","CreatedAt":"2023-03-02T19:08:35+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Your package's README is your chance to showcase your hard work and make a great first impression.

issue \"Parallel restore randomly fails package certificate trust (in container)\" (#10322) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: NuGet.exe\r\n\r\nNuGet version: 5.8.0.6930 (via Pipelines `NuGetToolInstaller@0` task)\r\n\r\nVS version: 2019 Build Tools v16.8.2\r\n\r\nOS version: Server 2019 (1809 build 17763.1577) + Docker hosting mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/runtime:3.5-windowsservercore-ltsc2019\r\n\r\nWorked before? If so, with which NuGet version: New scenario for us\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a Pipelines Docker-based build agent using steps similar to those at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/docker?view=azure-devops#windows and using the `--once` agent option.\r\n\r\n2. Use the resulting image with Docker Swarm on a 32-core host (so there are a couple of dozen agents running simultaneously).\r\n\r\n3. Start multiple builds for solutions containing 100+ projects each with restore steps, using a nuget.config containing `<add key='maxHttpRequestsPerSource' value='4' />`.\r\n\r\nWhat we are seeing is failures validating packages from nuget.org (`PackageSignatureValidity: False`). The failures appear nondeterministic -- the specific packages that succeed or fail look to be different each time, and the number of packages failing during a given run is not consistent either -- but the failure becomes more probable if more than one container's agent is restoring simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAdding the `-DisableParallelProcessing` flag seems to make the problem go away, at the cost of a longer time to restore, while lowering `maxHttpRequestsPerSource` seems to have no effect.\r\n\r\nSpeculation: each container sees itself has having 32 CPUs, so NuGet starts 32 concurrent restore jobs (if parallel processing is left on). The error messages suggest some sort of failure during certificate validation; assuming the certificate doesn't change but the outcome does, perhaps a request rate limit is being hit somewhere?\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n(Excerpts)\r\n\r\n> NU3028: Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository primary signature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.\r\n> NU3018: Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository primary signature found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.\r\n> Errors in C:\\vsts\\_work\\1\\s\\Web\\<project_name>.csproj\r\n>     NU3028: Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository primary signature's timestamp found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.\r\n>     NU3018: Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': The repository primary signature found a chain building issue: UntrustedRoot: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.\r\n\r\nLater:\r\n\r\n> PackageSignatureVerificationLog: PackageIdentity: Microsoft.AspNet.Razor.3.2.3 Source: https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json PackageSignatureValidity: False\r\n> Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': Signature Hash Algorithm: SHA256\r\n> Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': Timestamp: 12/14/2018 5:55:55 AM\r\n> \r\n> Package 'Microsoft.AspNet.Razor 3.2.3' from source 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json': Verifying repository primary signature's timestamp with timestamping service certificate: \r\n>   Subject Name: CN=Symantec SHA256 TimeStamping Signer -

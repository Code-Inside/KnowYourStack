This means when there are 10 patterns in the nuspec, each file in the zip will have a provider created for it 10 times. If there are 20 files, then that's 200 provider objects created to match these 20 files.\r\n\r\nUsing [NuGet Insights](https://github.com/NuGet/Insights), I see that of packages that have any `<contentFiles>` with a `*` in their nuspec, the average is 1.2 entries and the max is 21 entries. However, only 143 packages contain more than 1 `<contentFiles>` pattern in their nuspec, and of those only 3 packages have over 1 million downloads. Although one of them is marked is marked as deprecated. So, overall, it's hard to say whether implementing this will actually have a meaningful impact. The `SingleFileProvider` might actually be better for most packages, since few packages use file globbing with more than 1 pattern.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"29977241417","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-24T06:32:47","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12695","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Perf: ContentFileUtils uses expensive file globbing when not needed\" (#12695) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nOther/NA\n\n### Product Version\n\nall\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nNone\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nThis codepath is used when restoring projects using PackageReference, and uses packages that contain `contentFiles/`. Therefore, restore performance could be improved.\r\n\r\nWhen a package contains `contentFiles/`, and the project uses PackageReference, `ContentFileUtils.cs` is used to match the files in the zip, to metadata in the `.nuspec`. This code currently [always uses a file globbing API to do the match](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/4b6a87bfe90d247f961eba41d63dbf418a56fdcc/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/RestoreCommand/ContentFiles/ContentFileUtils.cs#L104-L148). However, using [NuGet Insights](https://github.com/NuGet/Insights), we can see that most packages that have `contentFiles/` do not use `*` or `?` characters in the `.nuspec` `<contentFiles>` definitions.\r\n\r\nDebugging restore with a suitable package, the way the NuGet uses the file globbing library, it will see a file `contentFiles/any/any/something.txt`, and a \"pattern\" `any/any/something.txt`, and the file globbing library will ask for the \"root directory\" (which in this case is `contentFiles/`, then ask if `contentFiles/` contains `any/`, then ask if `contentFiles/any/` contains `any/`, and finally if `contentFiles/any/any/` contains `something.txt`.\r\n\r\nSo, as we can see, there's a lot of unnecessary work that needs to be done because NuGet has a list of strings that represent the full path of all content files in the zip, and it's usually trying to match the substring following the `contentFiles/` prefix.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe this could be implemented to be much higher performance, although there are some `/` vs `\\` matching, and case sensitivity, issues that need to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nBasically, do \"simple\" string matching when the nuspec's entry's include doesn't contain either `*`, or `?` (and maybe if there's also no `exclude`, but an exclude doesn't make sense on an exact filename). Only use the file globbing library when file globbing is actually needed.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No

Open PM UI and prepare to perform a package installation. A package which requires license acceptance will make it easier to see the effect.\r\n2. Configure your project such that a restore error will occur.\r\n3. Perform the installation\r\n4. Observe a License Acceptance dialog appears.\r\n5. Accept the license\r\n6. Observe that Restore errors are shown.\r\n\r\nThe errors are shown during the execution of the restore here: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/f1757fe7a9a3e178562518f4535f71348a117010/src/NuGet.Clients/NuGet.PackageManagement.UI/Actions/UIActionEngine.cs#L471\r\n![image](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/assets/49205731/758539e1-8b6a-4a3a-99c6-820eb721d57c)\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"29944420112","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-22T18:07:59","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12689","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ContentItemCollection.FindBestItemGroup boxing enumerator\" (#12689) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1837339"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"29730541084","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-13T19:08:21","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/69","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE 2023-29337 | NuGet Client Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\" (#69) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2023-29337 | NuGet Client Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET and NuGet on Linux.

This is not currently supported with either a tool available to users or to site admins.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new account with the desired username.\r\n2. Add the new account as an owner on packages the old account owns.\r\n3. Accept ownership in the new account and remove the old account from ownership.\r\n4. Optionally, delete the old account.\r\n\r\nThis is workable in most cases but has some problems:\r\n\r\n- It's very painful if the number of accounts is high.\r\n- Other entities like ID prefix reservations or organization memberships are not transferred\r\n- API keys are reset\r\n- You need a second MSA or AAD account for the transition process\r\n\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nWe should provide a tool that allows either users or site admins to perform this operation easily.\r\n\r\nThere are issues to consider with this feature:\r\n\r\n- Username changes break client trust policies that use username\r\n- The old username should be blocked from usage to prevent impersonation attacks\r\n- Could this be used by spammers or other malicious actors to avoid detection?\r\n- Should we allow as many renames as you want? Or should there be some throttling? If we block old usernames this tool could be used to easily eat up a lot of usernames.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nThere is another related request of changing username casing: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5013. This could perhaps be solved at the same time.\r\n\r\nPast requests for a username change on our issue tracker are here:\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4673\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/1838\r\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/319"},{"Id":"23598110858","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-08-23T21:28:06","Actor":"camigthompson","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9193","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add section link support for READMEs\" (#9193) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Fixes the issue where internal section links in a README do not link to the specified section, but instead take a user back to the top.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8833 "},{"Id":"23594241873","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-08-23T17:45:59","Actor":"dorssel","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9204","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: Broken link \"Read more\" in warning\" (#9204) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

way to the 1.0.0 lib/net48 nuget folder.\r\nIf these version are not compatible, we get compile errors the next time compiling a project that requires 1.0.0.\r\nIf they are compatible it might work by stealth and nobody will notice.\r\nWe did not see this previously, but now that we strong name our nuget packages, we see unexpected binding redirects.\r\n\r\nWe use central package management\n\n###

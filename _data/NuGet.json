same issue\r\n* ran `dotnet tool restore`  => takes VERY LONG TIME => same error\r\n* deleted `global.json` => `dotnet tool restore` => went weird because `dotnet/arcade`\r\n* `dotnet nuget locals --clear all` => same issue\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nEditing `global.json` to use `preview7` (because, well I also use `preview7` on side project)\r\nFrom:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"sdk\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"5.0.100-rc.1.20379.10\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"tools\": {\r\n    \"dotnet\": \"5.0.100-rc.1.20379.10\",\r\n...\r\n```\r\nTo preview7\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"sdk\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"5.0.100-preview.7.20366.6\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"tools\": {\r\n    \"dotnet\": \"5.0.100-preview.7.20366.6\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt that time `restore.cmd` works and if I `git checkout global.json` and re-run `restore.cmd` it works again.\r\nI don't get it\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- ASP.NET Core version\r\n  `master` (commit `983e7ed635f4d128edce4191b51869bd7be8aced`)\r\n\r\n- Include the

If version is not increased it would use the older code of the same version from the nuget cache. After the successful testing, I would normally check in and the package version would be increased.\r\n\r\nKeeping both projects in the same solution is also not a good idea, as that would mean all the projects referencing project B should be in the same solution as B which defeats the purpose of nuget reference.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nWe ended up implementing a custom target that deletes the package in the nuget cache and updates it with the newly built pack.

These commands had leveraged the NuGet.Core library for automating the process of applying NuGet updates to project files, but that library looks to have long since been deprecated.  \r\n\r\nThere is an issue with upgrading netstandard2.0 packages within a project (TargetFrameworkVersion 4.7.2). The debug message flow from PackageManager is:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n> Looking for updates for 'MYPACKAGE'...\r\n\r\n> Updating 'MYPACKAGE' from version 'x.y.z' to 'a.b.c' in project 'MYPROJECT'.\r\n\r\n> Removing 'MYPACKAGE x.y.z' from MYPROJECT.\r\n\r\n> Added file 'packages.config'.\r\n> Successfully removed 'MYPACKAGE x.y.z' from MYPROJECT.\r\n\r\n> Adding 'MYPACKAGE a.b.c' to MYPROJECT.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nAt which point a \"MYPROJECT does not reference 'MYPACKAGE'\" error is thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is still using packages.config file to manage its NuGet package references.

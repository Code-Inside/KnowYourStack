These APIs might not conceptually make sense to be exposed together with a library. As an example, I'm working on [ComputeSharp](https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp), which is a high-level, easy to use library to do GPU processing in C#. This library has a dependency on [TerraFX.Interop.Windows](https://github.com/terrafx/terrafx.interop.windows), which provides extremely low-level bindings for Windows APIs. I don't want consumers of my library to also have TerraFX APIs pop up in their IntelliSense. These APIs are just an implementation detail for me, and conceptually they have nothing to do with what ComputeSharp aims to be - a high-level and accessible library.\r\n2. Having these APIs being exposed caused a potentially breaking dependency for consumers. Consider the case for ComputeSharp as before. If one day I wanted to change my backend for whatever reasons, and some consumers were using APIs from TerraFX as well, updating ComputeSharp would be a breaking change, even if I'd only be changing an internal implementation detail, and nothing on my public API surface.\r\n\r\nPoint 1. is the one I care about in particular. That's the same reason why me and many other library authors take special care in trimming the public API surface as much as possible to keep it clean - having every single indirect API being automatically visible to consumers completely undermines this, especially when these APIs are very different from the design of the library itself.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to add a new property that can be added to `PackageReference` items (eg. `PubliclyVisible`, defaulting to `true` for backwards compatibility) that when set to `false` would cause the following behavior:\r\n\r\n- APIs from these dependencies would not be visible for consumers. As in, trying to use them would fail to build.\r\n- Consumers would need to manually add a dependency to that package in their own project to see/use them.\r\n- These dependencies would still be visible when installing the NuGet package, as is today.\r\n\r\n## Alternative solutions (not viable)\r\n\r\n- Ask maintainers of these dependencies to provide source-only packages as well. This is clearly not viable in the majority of cases, and would be bad for code size anyway since consumers would end up with duplicated code across different assemblies.\r\n- Keep a local fork of needed packages and use them as private assets. This is not viable either as it would require a lot of work for library authors to keep forks in sync, not to mention this would have the same exact issue with duplicated code.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"14504734556","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-12T01:52:44","Actor":"dtivel","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10336","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"Cannot open the NuGet Package manager\" (#10336) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity2.visualstudio.com/t/Cannot-open-Nuget-browser/1265371)._\n\n---\n[severity:I'm unable to use this version] [regression] [worked-in:16.8.2]\r\nManaging Nuget packages > Browse brings up the following error\n!

It works great for `PackageReference`. Now I needed to use some content file in my project and I could not achieve the desired behavior with `PrivateAssets=\"all\"`. I want to build \"base\" package with one file `data.json` which should be consumed in \"top\" package but should not be exposed further to consumers of the \"top\" package.\r\n\r\nMy \"base\" package:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <IncludeBuildOutput>false</IncludeBuildOutput>\r\n    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <Content Include=\"data.json\">\r\n      <PackagePath>contentFiles/any/any/data.json</PackagePath>\r\n    </Content>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nThe result seems to be good for me:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21261007/69996708-a573d980-1563-11ea-8069-bb275803e1fb.png)\r\n\r\nMy \"top\" package:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"BasePackage\" Version=\"1.0.0\">\r\n      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>\r\n    </PackageReference>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Result is unexpected for me:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21261007/69997235-bc66fb80-1564-11ea-8c80-23e46bfa7cdb.png)\r\n\r\nWhy is the file again in the content section? This file is a development dependency, some sort of settings file. The \"base\" package is a package with Roslyn analyzers and the settings file - `data.json`. I do not present the analyzers used for clarity. For them, `PrivateAssets` works as it should - they do not fall into the dependencies of the \"base\" package. But for the settings file - `data.json`, I can’t get the same behavior.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time resolving this issue and it seems to me that I do not see any obvious solution, which is somewhere nearby. I will be very grateful for the advice.\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"14085142486","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-05T00:13:18","Actor":"jcjiang","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/48","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"November dry run for custom V2 OData query deprecation\" (#48) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"\r\nWe announced the deprecation of custom V2 OData queries (https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/37) last year and we will begin blocking endpoints used by 3rd party clients in **February 2021**. \r\n\r\nWe will conduct **a dry run of the OData deprecation** to ensure that there are no surprises for users, which is scheduled to ensure overlap with normal working hours across the globe.

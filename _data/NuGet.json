Please describe.\r\nImagine a company setting up a package publishing pipeline that builds and publishes NuGet packages. They already have an organization on NuGet.org with two admins A and B. The pipeline needs an API key to have packages published on behalf of that organization. Currently, only actual user accounts can have API keys, so either A or B have to create a personal API key and put it into the pipeline (let's say, A did it). Now, API keys expire, so at some point A will receive a notification about it, but at that time they can be unavailable for some reason to rotate keys (sick, left the company, etc.); B, while being a member of that organization, will not get notified about that. So the key expires and publishing pipeline breaks. This is a single point of failure.\r\nAlternatively, our admins thought about that and decided to create a separate account for generating API keys and share credentials for that account. This comes with some maintenance required within their org (the account needs a unique email being able to have Microsoft account associated with it, organization might require password rotation for that account, the emails received by that account has to be forwarded, etc.) and it is now unclear who uses that shared account: we are getting in a situation that organizations tried to address (not using shared accounts).\r\nWe need a way to reliably rotate API keys that are used within organizations.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI see several options:\r\n* When creating API key scoped for organization allow to specify other organization members who would get expiration notification for the API key and let some organization members (admins?) see all keys scoped for the organization in web UI;\r\n  * Variation of that would be to allow to specify arbitrary email address list to receive that notification;\r\n  * Another variation: always send organization key expiration emails to all admins/members;\r\n* Add the capability to have an API key tied to an organization directly and hence make admins collectively own it. Make sure it is possible to track individual key creation to a specific user.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"12501326093","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-02T00:57:37","Actor":"zhhyu","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8018","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update max supported nuget client version\" (#8018) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Client has published the latest version \"nuget.exe v5.7.0-preview1\" here:\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/downloads\r\nhttps://dist.nuget.org/tools.json"},{"Id":"12501132430","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-02T00:19:02","Actor":"zhhyu","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8018","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update max supported nuget client version\" (#8018) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Client has published the latest version \"nuget.exe v5.7.0-preview1\" here:\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/downloads\r\nhttps://dist.nuget.org/tools.json"},{"Id":"12500363534","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T22:05:45","Actor":"loic-sharma","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7972","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Stats page - NuGet Client Usage shows \"1B\" for multiple ticks\" (#7972) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nNuGet Client Usage shows \"1B\" for multiple ticks on the Y axis.

See: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/src/PublicApiAnalyzers/PublicApiAnalyzers.Help.md\r\n\r\nFor NuGet projects that are packed, we should track public API changes, to minimise breaking existing APIs, and be more intentional about adding new APIs.\r\n\r\nIn short, the way it works is the analyzer expects two files. `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` and `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt`. These files list all the public APIs in a project, and when the analyzer runs, it generates its own list of all public APIs in the project and compares to the union of all the APIs listed in the two text files. If there are any differences (public API in code not listed in files, or API listed in file not found in the code), it generates a warning, which we elevate to an error. \r\n\r\nThe analyzer does not support having APIs listed in the file that only appear in some TargetFrameworks and not others, so instead a seperate set of files are used for each TFM. This means the files are mostly duplicates of each other, with only small differences where the public API surface is different. It also means when there are changes to the public API surface, for example a new API that is added to all project TFMs, multiple `PublicApi.*.txt` files needs to be modified.\r\n\r\nHow we use the `Shipped` verses `Unshipped` files is to our discression. The analyzer has a fix which will add new APIs to the `Unshipped` file. It appears the intention is to manually move the contents of the file to the `Shipped` file when the assembly ships, so it's easier to track new APIs that have been added, but not yet shipped, in case the API should be changed before customers start using it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose that we use this feature with the following workflow:\r\n\r\n* All projects that set `PackProject` to `true` use the analyzer\r\n  * `NuGet.CommandLine` will be excempt, as one of its distribution methods is as a nupkg, but it is not intended to be a library.\r\n  * Currently, some of our test utility projects are packed as nupkgs. I don't know the reason, but I do not believe we should support backwards compatibility for these projects\r\n* When a new API is added, use the code fix to add the new API to the appropriate `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` file(s).\r\n* When doing a code revew, a very strong justification is needed to remove any public APIs that need to be removed from `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt`.\r\n* When doing a code review, when a `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` file is in the diff, question why the public API is needed.\r\n* When NuGet's packages are released with release branding (not previews), part of the publishing steps that HotSeat need to do is to merge all contents of `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` files with their `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` counterparts, to signal that all new APIs (since the previous GA release) have now been shipped and there is a higher bar to change them now."},{"Id":"12490775364","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-01T01:36:09","Actor":"jkotas","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9631","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Source distribution of native libraries via NuGet\" (#9631) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"It is not unusual for NuGet packages to contain native libraries. Today, the NuGet package author is responsible for providing native libraries for all platforms that the NuGet package can run on. If the consumer of the library wishes to use the library on a platform that is not on this list, there is no simple standard way for how to recompile the native library for the new platform. Most users just give up.\r\n\r\nOther ecosystems solve this problem by having both source and binary distributions of native libraries.

I thought I'd start here.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a Xamarin Forms project with a dependency on a NuGet package that bundles a native library. That native library is correctly copied into a UWP package's `.appx`, and appropriately P/Invokable. The library's Android version is _not_ copied into the resultant `.apk`, and when the NuGet package attempts P/Invoking, it fails with a predictable DllNotFoundException.\r\n\r\nThe NuGet package in question is version 1.0.5.1 of this package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScannitSharp/.

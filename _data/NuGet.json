It only applies to packages.config.\r\n\r\nWe could introduce support to project.json world by lifting transitive dependencies to the parent project.\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nConsider you have a project.json and you want to install WindowsAzure.Storage 6.2.0. This package depends on Newtonsoft.Json 6.0.8. Today if you install WindowsAzure.Storage, you will get a project.json like this:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"WindowsAzure.Storage\": \"6.2.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the lock file, NuGet would have resolved the lowest version that meets the dependency's spec, which means that Newtonsoft.Json 6.0.8 would be restored.\r\n\r\nWith `DependencyBehavior.Highest`, the highest version of Newtonsoft.Json should be picked (which is 9.0.1 today). Since project.json default behavior is taking the lowest, we could observe this `DependencyBehavior.Highest` option by lifting Newtonsoft.Json 9.0.1 to the project.json automatically, resulting in a project.json that looks like this:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"WindowsAzure.Storage\": \"6.2.0\",\r\n    \"Newtonsoft.Json\": \"9.0.1\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## -dependencyVersion in restore?\r\n\r\nLifting dependencies to the parent is one possibility, but this causes the user's project to become crowded with a potentially huge number of transitive dependencies (just look at the full graph of NETStandard.Library metapackage).\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to support -dependencyVersion in restore itself so that, as NuGet walks transitive dependencies, it picks Highest instead of Lowest as it goes. This is a significant behavior change in project.json and, as @emgarten notes, this can lead to wacky results especially with CoreFX packages that change a lot from one minor release to the next.\r\n\r\nMore thought and design needed.\r\n"},{"Id":"12211653821","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-05-01T00:25:27","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6201","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGet chooses incorrect references for System.Reflection.TypeExtensions.dll for .NET Core for UWP 5.2.2 if Windows SDK Target version is 10.0.16299\" (#6201) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"NuGet chooses incorrect references for System.Reflection.TypeExtensions.dll for .NET Core for UWP 5.2.2 if Windows SDK Target version is 10.0.16299 causing types like System.Reflection.BindingFlags to fail to resolve and consequently build failures.\r\n\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): NuGet.exe via MSBuild called from Visual Studio F5.\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): 4.4.0\r\n\r\nVS version: 2017 15.4.0\r\n\r\nOS version: Windows 10.0.15063\r\n\r\nWorked before?

One of the projects is a Wix installer project (wixproj), which cannot be converted to the new style.\r\n\r\nThe Wix project references the NuGet package [Wix 3.11.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WiX/3.11.1), so that the project can be built on a build machine without needing to install Wix tools there.\r\n\r\nRun `nuget restore` on the solution with Wix tools not installed locally, and Wix package not existing in solution packages directory. The error can also be simulated with Wix installed by directly editing the wixproj file and changing the following elements to a bogus path:\r\n\r\n    <WixTargetsPath Condition=\" '$(WixTargetsPath)' == '' AND '$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)' != '' \">$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\WiX\\v3.x\\Wix.targets</WixTargetsPath>\r\n    <WixTargetsPath Condition=\" '$(WixTargetsPath)' == '' \">$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\Microsoft\\WiX\\v3.x\\Wix.targets</WixTargetsPath>\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved behavior:\r\n* nuget reports the following error: \r\n> C:\\Work\\Norway\\Device-agents\\DeviceAgentSetup\\DeviceAgentSetup.wixproj(95,3): error MSB4019: The imported project \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Professional\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\WiX\\v3.x\\Wix.targets\" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.\r\n> \r\n> WARNING: Error reading msbuild project information, ensure that your input solution or project file is valid. NETCore and UAP projects will be skipped, only packages.config files will be restored.\r\n* Even though the failing project is an old-style project (and even though the build target is not at all relevant for package restoration), this error breaks package restoration for all new-style projects.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n* If nuget encounters an error in one of the projects, it should ignore the error in old-style projects, and only skip that project in new-style projects. (Arguably, it should ignore missing build targets completely.)\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n* Run `nuget restore` separately on the wixproj project before running `nuget restore` on solution.\r\n\r\nTested with nuget version 4.9.2.5706"},{"Id":"12211530495","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-05-01T00:03:37","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8947","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Port the dev guide to GitHub\" (#8947) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Right now it's a One Note. \r\nIt's more useful in the repo in some sort of a doc. \r\n\r\n\r\nIdeas from NuGet/NuGet.Client#3180\r\n\r\n- NuGet and target frameworks\r\n\r\n- NuGet + dependencies, how to add a new dependency in the NuGet client.

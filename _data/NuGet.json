So my \"content\" starts at the root directory.\r\n\r\nSample file layout:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS E:\\temp\\nugetProblem2> dir -Recurse\r\n\r\n    Directory: E:\\temp\\nugetProblem2\r\n\r\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                 -------------         ------ ----\r\nd----           8/17/2020  8:10 PM                .git\r\n-a---           8/17/2020  8:13 PM              4 .gitignore\r\n-a---           8/17/2020  8:18 PM            309 nugetProblem.nuspec\r\n-a---           8/17/2020  8:09 PM             52 ReadMe.txt\r\n\r\n    Directory: E:\\temp\\nugetProblem2\\.git\r\n\r\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                 -------------         ------ ----\r\n-a---           8/17/2020  8:10 PM              4 shouldNotBePacked.txt\r\n\r\nPS E:\\temp\\nugetProblem2>\r\n```\r\nWhen I run \"nuget pack\", it very clearly tells me:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: NU5119: File 'E:\\temp\\nugetProblem2\\.gitignore' was not added to the package. Files and folders starting with '.' or ending with '.nupkg' are excluded by default.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in fact it *does* exclude the \".gitignore\" file. But it does **NOT** exclude the \".git\" directory.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, I have not been able to come up with an \"exclude\" directive, either on the command line or in the .nuspec file, to exclude the \".git\" directory.\r\n\r\n### Repro steps, with sample project\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample/dummy project that will reproduce the problem:\r\n[nugetProblem.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/5087988/nugetProblem.zip)\r\n\r\n**Repro steps:**\r\n1. Extract the sample project.\r\n2. In the root of the sample project directory, run \"nuget pack\".\r\n3. Observe the warning message about how \"Files and folders starting with '.'\" will not be packed.\r\n4. Rename the resulting .nupkg to .zip and open it up.\r\n\r\n**Expected result:**\r\nThe .git folder should not be in the package.\r\n\r\n**Actual result:**\r\nThe .git folder is in the package.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"13225510465","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-17T21:21:06","Actor":"srdjanjovcic","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9920","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Create a dashboard for monitoring RPS tests\" (#9920) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"It would be great if we have a dashboard to monitor RPS tests over time."},{"Id":"13225369684","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-17T21:02:47","Actor":"zkat","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9692","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Check Security Tenet status\" (#9692) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Investigate the AzDO tasks assigned to me that ask us to check some Security points in our codebase."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"12779263648","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-30T21:31:53","Actor":"t-mog-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/46","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Advanced Search on NuGet.org\" (#46) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec for 'Advanced Search on NuGet.org' is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n| Spec wiki | Discussion issue |\r\n| :----------:| :----------------: |\r\n| [Advanced Search on NuGet.org](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Advanced-Search-on-NuGet.org) | [NuGet/NuGetGallery#2636](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/2636) |"},{"Id":"12582399620","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-09T17:20:40","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/45","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"CVE-2020-1340 - NuGet Gallery Spoofing Vulnerability\" (#45) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"A spoofing vulnerability exists when the NuGet Gallery does not properly sanitize input on package metadata values.

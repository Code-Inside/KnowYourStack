A fix would be nice\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nVisual Studio extensions can reference `NuGet.VisualStudio` to use NuGet's APIs in Visual Studio, including `IVsPackageInstaller(2)` which can install packages in projects programatically.  In NuGet 6.0.0 (VS 17.0), [we documented that these APIs can be called from a background thread](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4209). However, under the following scenario there can be a deadlock:\r\n\r\n1. The extension uses JTF.Run to run some async code that switches to a background thread and blocks the UI thread until this background thread work completes\r\n2. The background thread work calls into `IVsPackageInstaller.InstallPackage`\r\n3. NuGet's `VsPackageInstaller` uses `PumpingJTF`, but on the background thread, not the UI thread\r\n4. When the project uses packages.config and the package contains `tools/install.ps1`, NuGet runs the powershell script, also on a background thread\r\n5. Since NuGet passes `DTE.Project` to the script, the .NET runtime wants to do COM RPC on the UI thread, but the .NET runtime doesn't know anything about JTF and therefore deadlocks the code blocking in step 1.\r\n\r\nThe deadlock doesn't happen when none of the packages being installed contain a powershell files, or if the project uses `PackageReference` (since any powershell scripts aren't run).\r\n\r\n**mitigation**: If the VS extension calling NuGet either does not block the UI thread (don't do step 1 above), or calls NuGet on the UI thread, then this will not deadlock.\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"19563721209","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-01-03T20:08:59","Actor":"jebriede","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11112","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Establish baseline for vulnerable packages installed\" (#11112) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"19563337223","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-01-03T19:32:05","Actor":"kartheekp-ms","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11475","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: Reduce string allocations in restore code path\" (#11475) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe, MSBuild.exe, NuGet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\ndotnet restore, msbuild restore on OrchardCore repo\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

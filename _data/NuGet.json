We will adjust the test duration based on customer feedback.\r\n\r\nDuring the scream test, **Alpine Linux** customers may encounter **DNS failures** from the [V3 API](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-org/overview-nuget-org#api-endpoint-for-nugetorg) due to this [issue](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9736). To mitigate, we recommend that Alpine Linux customers migrate to **Alpine Linux 3.18.0** or a newer version. These newer versions support **TCP fallback** in the DNS resolver.\r\n\r\nTo ensure uninterrupted service during the test, please use the [V2 API](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-org/overview-nuget-org#api-endpoint-for-nugetorg) instead.\r\n\r\nIf you have any **feedback**, **concerns**, or **questions**, feel free to reach out to us at support@nuget.org or by commenting on the discussion issue: [NuGet/Home#12985](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/discussions/12985)."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2024-09-24T03:30:21.9129087Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":884}

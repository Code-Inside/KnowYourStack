Specifically, the error message is:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.http.ConnectionClosedException: Premature end of Content-Length delimited message body (expected: 67,830; received: 0), Cause: Premature end of Content-Length delimited message body (expected: 67,830; received: 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is not specific to Nexus RM. It can be also observed by attempting to download the specific version of the package from a browser. \r\n\r\nOn the package page at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions/6.0.0, clicking the *Download package* link in the sidebar point to https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions/6.0.0. \r\n\r\nThis redirects to https://globalcdn.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.extensions.configuration.abstractions.6.0.0.nupkg, which responds with these headers:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontent-length: 67830\r\ncontent-md5: AEtFGYgfyXDXs/Svsym4yw==\r\ncontent-type: application/octet-stream\r\ndate: Fri, 28 Oct 2022 15:10:10 GMT\r\netag: 0x8D9A2821DFD2A82\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, in particular, `content-length` indicates a response body of `67830` should follow. However, the response size is actually zero.\r\n\r\nThis confirms the HTTP protocol violation reported by Nexus RM, and results in the download of a zero-sized `microsoft.extensions.configuration.abstractions.6.0.0.nupkg` file.\r\n\r\nIn case it matters, the server IP address that returns the zero-length response is 52.240.159.111.\r\n\n\n### Repro Steps\n\n1. On this page https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions/6.0.0\r\n2. Open the browser developer tools, and click the *Download package* link in the sidebar.\r\n3. The initial request to https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions/6.0.0 is redirected to https://globalcdn.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.extensions.configuration.abstractions.6.0.0.nupkg\r\n4. Note in the browser developer tools that the final response includes a `content-length: 67830` header.\r\n5. Examine the `microsoft.extensions.configuration.abstractions.6.0.0.nupkg` as saved by the browser, and note that its size is zero.\r\n\r\nThe mismatch between the declared `content-length` and actual response body size is an HTTP protocol violation. The impact is that an invalid NuGet package file is served to clients.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA 66.24 KB `microsoft.extensions.configuration.abstractions.6.0.0.nupkg` to be served, matching the information shown at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions/6.0.0\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"24880558370","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-10-28T00:22:38","Actor":"Zettersten","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9289","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Feature]: Facet or categorical searches based on package \"type\" or \"sdk type\"\" (#9289) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Related Problem\n\nMy peers and I would love to discover new Blazor related packages. For me, that involves going to Nuget.org and typing \"Blazor\" before the rest of my query. \r\n\r\nThis type of search query will return results where the term \"Blazor\" exists in some form or fashion within the readme, description, or title (and more I'm sure). However, I've seen cases where packages do not include the word \"Blazor\" in the aforementioned places. for them, they are excluded from results.\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nTired of prepending the word \"Blazor\" to the search box on Nuget.org? Me too! \r\n\r\nLet's introduce a search feature that allows users to check a box to \"fine tune\" the result set. A user can check (for example) Blazor, MVC, Razor Component, MVC API, Minimal API, etc... And only results that fit the criteria are returned.\r\n\r\n1. It's a better UX\r\n2. Has discoverability side-effects\r\n3.

I want to find packages relevant to the codes bases I'm working in.\r\n\r\n1. Github has a page dedicated to exploring. They have highlights, trending repos, language specific filtering, etc...\r\n2. NPM is more convention based. If I want to search all things related to gulp. I'd search \"gulp-*\". Or something specific to the world of express. I'd search \"express-*\". Or another approach would be \"@vercel/*\" where this query implies that I want all packages related to vercel.\r\n\r\nFFT"},{"Id":"24879754903","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T23:05:43","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9269","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[A11y]Syntax highlighting in Read Mes does not have sufficient contrast.\" (#9269) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Environment Details:\r\nApplication Name: NuGet Service\r\n#URL: https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoMapper/\r\nWindows version: Windows 10\r\nChromiumEdge Version: 105.0.1343.42 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\nChecking the URL above, the syntax highlighting in the readme does not meet sufficient contrast requirements."},{"Id":"24879753612","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-10-27T23:05:36","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9258","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: The generated link for owner request is broken.\" (#9258) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\r\n\r\nIt's more difficult to complete my work\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe link in the email doesn't point to www.nuget.org.\r\n\r\n### Repro Steps\r\n\r\nAdd a package owner and check the generated link in the email.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe link should be workable.

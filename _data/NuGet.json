As a result, in order for me to be able to run \"build.ps1\" I'm finding that I not only need to codesign all the included *.ps* files, I'm also having to make an amendment to \"build.ps1\" in so that it signs the [NuGet/NuGet/ServerCommon/build/init.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuGet/ServerCommon/$BuildBranchCommit/build/init.ps1) file before it tries to import it and use functions from it during the build process.\r\n\r\nI'm accomplishing this by adding the following line in between that file being downloaded and it being run:\r\nSet-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath \"$PSScriptRoot/build/init.ps1\" -Certificate (@(ls Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My\\ -code)[-1]) \r\n\r\nBut I'm still having a problem building the project afterwards. I have had it running since the start of 2022 and just tried to update it and I when I try to get it to build I'm receiving errors and the :\r\n\r\n\"BUILD FAILED: The term 'Remove-EditorconfigFile' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file\".\r\n\r\nNow, I've found the 'Remove-EditorconfigFile' function in https://github.com/NuGet/ServerCommon/blob/main/build/common.ps1 So I'm assuming that that's being pulled down by the ServerCommon/init.ps1 file but because it's being built on the fly, I can't sign it, so that function never gets imported and the build fails.\n\n### Repro Steps\n\n1.

project level and throwing all the way to the solution restore job. \r\n\r\nI think the original idea behind this was a warning NU1900, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu1900, but we should consider whether need to differentiate between a source being inaccessible altogether and a source not supporting vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nIMO, we should not log a warning if we can't access the feed altogether, as that'd be surfaced by other means potentially, but that would break some scenarios, so maybe we log a min message instead in that case?\r\nWe should log an NU1900 warning if the source has vulnerabilities and they're broken for any reason.\r\n\r\ncc @zivkan

From the orchestrator's perspective, this was the sequence of events:\r\n\r\nThread | Event\r\n-- | --\r\n1 | Received message\r\n1 | Determined `ScanAndSign` is complete\r\n1 | Start the copy of the `ScanAndSign` .nupkg to the `validation-set` location\r\n2 | Received message\r\n2 | Determined `ScanAndSign` is complete\r\n2 | Start the copy of the `ScanAndSign` .nupkg to the `validation-set` location\r\n1 | Clean up the `ScanAndSign` .nupkg\r\n1 | Start `PackageSigningValidator2`\r\n1 | Complete message\r\n2 | **Copy fails with source missing**\r\n\r\nWhen the copy on thread 2 fails, it has already set the destination blob to zero bytes.\r\n\r\nThe copy process uses an empty etag condition so it has no problem clobbering the validation set package with a \"duplicate\" copy operation. The line of code is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Jobs/blob/c3912a04df42ab4146b1cd8069f3baf8a3793d9b/src/NuGet.Services.Validation.Orchestrator/ValidationPackageFileService.cs#L226\r\n\r\nWhen the `PackageSigningValidator2` wakes up to validate the package, it sees an empty blob and fails.\r\n\r\n## Mitigation\r\n\r\nRevalidating the package fixes the problem every time from my experience.\r\n\r\nIf this happens a lot, we can do our best to reduce message duplication by turning off queue-back. Note that this will increase validation times.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nI talked to @agr and we came up with three solutions, one which was ruled out.\r\n\r\n1. Add a `validation-set` package etag so that one of the copies fails with etag mismatch.\r\n1. Add a lease on the `validation-set` package.\r\n1. ~~Don't clean up the `ScanAndSign` copy and less blob storage cleanup do it's thing~~. We can't do this one because you can still have a slow processor completion clobber a subsequent blob. For example, processor A is being completed still but the `validation-set` blob has already been updated with work from processor B.\r\n\r\n## Detecting the problem\r\n\r\n```\r\ntraces\r\n| where timestamp > todatetime('2019-10-09T01:00:00') \r\n| where message contains \"VALIDATION SET ID OF THE PACKAGE\"\r\n| extend callGuid = tostring(customDimensions.CallGuid)\r\n| extend instanceName = tostring(customDimensions.InstanceName)\r\n| where instanceName !startswith \"Validation.Orchestrator-\"\r\n| order by timestamp desc\r\n| project timestamp, callGuid, instanceName, message\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `Validation.PackageSigning.ProcessSignature-*` logs, you'll see something like this over and over:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDownloaded 0 bytes in 0.0104824 seconds for request...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nValidation Set IDs:\r\n\r\n### DEV\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-09-30 -

This would mean that package developers don't have to duplicate reference material into the README.md, when it's already present in the package.\r\n\r\nAn extra bonus would be some sort of link syntax in the `README.md` that can link to types and methods in the API Reference tab, like `[ISomeInterface](#api-explorer-ISomeInterface)`.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"34752483933","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-11T15:42:54","Actor":"omer-agranov","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9775","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: Face 504/502 errors while Restore Packages on AWS eu-centasl-1 region\" (#9775) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\r\n\r\nI'm unable to use NuGet.org\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nwhile using dotnet cli restore we started to get 502 and 504 errors from Nuget \r\n\r\nfor test we run curl with this url: https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/awssdk.core/index.json\r\n\r\nwe run it from a machines in aws eu-central-1a and eu-cenbtral-1b and fails most of the times (not always)\r\non eu-central-1c it worked every time we run the command\r\n\r\nwhen we test it using curl command and it fails, instead of results we get the following message:\r\n\r\n\r\n`<body>\r\n    <div id='content'>\r\n        <div id='message'>\r\n            <h2>Our services aren't available right now</h2>\r\n            <p>We're working to restore all services as soon as possible.

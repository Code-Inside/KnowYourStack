of the original problems called out in the [a11y bug](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1468969) was related to the contrast between the search sign and the white background (the search bar), but it looks like the wrong background color was selected in their tests, and I could not reproduce it while using Accessibility Insights myself.\r\n\r\nTheir screenshot:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82980589/156466090-cabbae21-3474-4382-9b91-70ce1e361529.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I looked into

there were other accessibility concerns because of contrast ratios here, which I've tried to fix.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\nOn NuGet.org, when navigating a page using the keyboard (tab key), buttons would get a black outline and would darken their original color.

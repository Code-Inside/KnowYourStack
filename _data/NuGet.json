If I'm lucky and the requests get directed to a good server, I could restore the package, but at times I got the above error.\n\n### Repro Steps\n\n1. Update **hosts** file to point api.nuget.org to a problematic server. E.g. `13.107.246.18 api.nuget.org`.\r\n2. Go to the nuget URL either with a browser or curl, e.g. `https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.abstractions/index.json`\r\n3. See the redirect loop\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nResponse 200 OK with the expected content.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\nRunning

So the global.json file is in the same directory as the project, but in the Visual Studio case the default creation case is to create a solution folder and a project sub-folder. The project sub-folder contains the global.json file in this case. The MSBuild NuGet SDK Resolver fails to locate the global.json file in the project folder.\r\n\r\nThe issue was trigger by this [#4380](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4380) I believe. There was a subsequent bug and a change with this [#4507](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4507).\r\n\r\nThat secondary change almost fixes the issue for me, but unfortunately it does not handle the case when the resolver context defines both a solution and project. The existing [code](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver/GlobalJsonReader.cs#L100) means the solution always wins even if the project is set. The consequence is that a global.json in the project folder is not found. I believe a change to check the project file path context first would resolve this problem.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"21341148536","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-18T20:24:34","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11724","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: No way to suppress very noisy \"The project ... is using CentralPackageVersionManagement, a NuGet preview feature.\"\" (#11724) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\n6.0.200\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt bothers me.

From the orchestrator's perspective, this was the sequence of events:\r\n\r\nThread | Event\r\n-- | --\r\n1 | Received message\r\n1 | Determined `ScanAndSign` is complete\r\n1 | Start the copy of the `ScanAndSign` .nupkg to the `validation-set` location\r\n2 | Received message\r\n2 | Determined `ScanAndSign` is complete\r\n2 | Start the copy of the `ScanAndSign` .nupkg to the `validation-set` location\r\n1 | Clean up the `ScanAndSign` .nupkg\r\n1 | Start `PackageSigningValidator2`\r\n1 | Complete message\r\n2 | **Copy fails with source missing**\r\n\r\nWhen the copy on thread 2 fails, it has already set the destination blob to zero bytes.\r\n\r\nThe copy process uses an empty etag condition so it has no problem clobbering the validation set package with a \"duplicate\" copy operation. The line of code is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Jobs/blob/c3912a04df42ab4146b1cd8069f3baf8a3793d9b/src/NuGet.Services.Validation.Orchestrator/ValidationPackageFileService.cs#L226\r\n\r\nWhen the `PackageSigningValidator2` wakes up to validate the package, it sees an empty blob and fails.\r\n\r\n## Mitigation\r\n\r\nRevalidating the package fixes the problem every time from my experience.\r\n\r\nIf this happens a lot, we can do our best to reduce message duplication by turning off queue-back. Note that this will increase validation times.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nI talked to @agr and we came up with three solutions, one which was ruled out.\r\n\r\n1. Add a `validation-set` package etag so that one of the copies fails with etag mismatch.\r\n1. Add a lease on the `validation-set` package.\r\n1. ~~Don't clean up the `ScanAndSign` copy and less blob storage cleanup do it's thing~~. We can't do this one because you can still have a slow processor completion clobber a subsequent blob. For example, processor A is being completed still but the `validation-set` blob has already been updated with work from processor B.\r\n\r\n## Detecting the problem\r\n\r\n```\r\ntraces\r\n| where timestamp > todatetime('2019-10-09T01:00:00') \r\n| where message contains \"VALIDATION SET ID OF THE PACKAGE\"\r\n| extend callGuid = tostring(customDimensions.CallGuid)\r\n| extend instanceName = tostring(customDimensions.InstanceName)\r\n| where instanceName !startswith \"Validation.Orchestrator-\"\r\n| order by timestamp desc\r\n| project timestamp, callGuid, instanceName, message\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `Validation.PackageSigning.ProcessSignature-*` logs, you'll see something like this over and over:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDownloaded 0 bytes in 0.0104824 seconds for request...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nValidation Set IDs:\r\n\r\n### DEV\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-09-30 - dccf5bef-f050-4655-a3df-148ae192605e\r\n2019-10-09 - d81c7729-8bdb-4cac-b1d9-e20b2979af90\r\n```\r\n\r\n### INT\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-10-10 - 4b1517a4-0f4f-4aef-b16d-3e8bede745b2 - GroupDocs.Viewer 19.9.0-alpha-20191010083705\r\n```\r\n\r\n### PROD\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-10-09 - 60f1974a-11e8-4c95-9eea-74119e80a24b - HZH_Controls 1.0.7\r\n2019-10-09 - 495d3ff0-7912-4f1e-a8a7-4c9ace92b8c2 - amgbuild 0.28.0\r\n2019-10-09 - e963448d-64e4-4b00-a3c7-5f722b118dc5 - PeanutButter.TempDb.Runner 1.2.310\r\n2019-10-09 - 804c07a8-6c5c-4c4d-91b2-b1df70aff4b3 - MassTransit.DocumentDb 5.5.6-develop.2194\r\n2019-10-09 - cf2a2dd4-97aa-4e0c-b27c-4bfcb4f6155b - WebVella.TagHelpers 1.0.24\r\n2019-10-09 - bbb4d00c-28a2-41e3-9686-90f613fc8716 - IDTechSDK 1.2.174.3\r\n2019-10-10 - 355ba0f9-1b0e-4e85-bdaf-27e66c21b9ba - RobotRaconteurNET 0.9.1\r\n```"},{"Id":"10699736034","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-23T21:40:41","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7629","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add pessimistic concurrent control to orchestrator to reduce concurrency issues\" (#7629) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Related to https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7590.\r\n\r\nValidation.SymbolsOrchestrator\r\n- Release: [483281](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_releaseProgress?releaseId=483281&_a=release-pipeline-progress)\r\n- [x] DEV\r\n- [x] INT\r\n- [x] PROD\r\n\r\nValidation.Orchestrator\r\n- Release: [483284](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_releaseProgress?_a=release-pipeline-progress&releaseId=483284)\r\n- [x] DEV\r\n- [x] INT\r\n- [x] PROD"},{"Id":"10699246630","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-23T20:30:48","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7643","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[ReleasePrep][2019.10.22]RI dev into master\" (#7643) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Heartbeat support\r\nNet472 upgrade\r\nSxS search page improvement\r\nEF 6.3 upgrade\r\nGravatar proxy test."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"10709067137","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-24T21:08:45","Actor":"lithium112","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8746","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"If nuget installation is terminated unexpectedly, retrying does nothing\" (#8746) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: NuGet.exe \r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): 5.3.0.6260\r\n\r\nOS version: Windows Server 2019, but likely not OS version dependent.\r\n\r\nWorked before?

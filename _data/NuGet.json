`files` section (for the `src` and `exclude` attributes) and NuGet does not seem to handle wildcards properly.\r\n\r\nWith the following `nuspec` file, only `./nuget-content/logo.png` will be copied (and all files inside `folder1` will be ignored - without any warnings in the verbose logs):\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<package> \r\n  <metadata> \r\n

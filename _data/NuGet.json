This happens both on nuget.org and when searching through Visual Studio. It's almost impossible to find that package unless you actually know the exact name.\r\n\r\nNot exactly the same, but possibly related to https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8130?\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nHere's some search results I tried:\r\n\r\n⛔ \"microsoft high performance\" ([screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/92381423-1eafe680-f10b-11ea-9c3d-6e11c3a8ce57.png)), the package is nowhere to be found\r\n⛔ \"microsoft highperformance\" ([screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/92381483-3a1af180-f10b-11ea-8c25-4a05e83bd5bb.png)), same as above\r\n⛔ \"Microsoft HighPerformance\" ([screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/92381513-4acb6780-f10b-11ea-9a3a-7192e410befe.png)), same\r\n⛔ \"microsoft toolkit high performance\" ([screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/92381544-5a4ab080-f10b-11ea-8a11-24d6600a4e38.png)), same\r\n⛔ \"microsoft toolkit highperformance\" ([screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/92381566-68003600-f10b-11ea-8a7d-f5ec4d5dc4bd.png)), same\r\n\r\n✅ \"microsoft.toolkit.highperformance\" ([screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/92381616-7e0df680-f10b-11ea-8e86-b99fc8fb4a61.png)), works\r\n✅ \"Microsoft.Toolkit.HighPerformance\" ([screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/92381692-9a119800-f10b-11ea-820b-113cde208b39.png)), works too\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe `Microsoft.Toolkit.HighPerformance` should be the first result for all these various search queries.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nAttached a screen next to each tested query above.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nIn case it helps, right now we have the following tags in the package:\r\n\r\n> UWP Toolkit Windows core standard unsafe span memory string array stream buffer extensions helpers parallel performance\r\n\r\nThough I'd expect the search results to display that package as first result even just based on the package name, as all those sample queries are an exact match for the package name, once tokenized with the `.` and converted to lowercase.\r\nI wouldn't expect users to search for the package by the exact name (which is also more verbose to type), especially if they just are not aware the package exists at all, so the way the search results are returned right now doesn't help with discoverability.\r\n\r\nThanks! 😊"},{"Id":"13417444076","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-04T21:17:34","Actor":"loic-sharma","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8200","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[V3 monitoring] Avoid using obsolete search clients\" (#8200) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"The V3 metadata monitoring job uses the obsoleted [`RawSearchResourceV3`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/e97d556a83750bb4f8017e3640bc699d04832657/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/Resources/RawSearchResourceV3.cs#L17-L18) type to monitor specific search instances (see [this](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Jobs/blob/dd26676619c5901c9924fc9b3286ba263c41a446/src/NuGet.Services.Metadata.Catalog.Monitoring/Validation/Test/ValidationContext.cs#L128-L129)).

Almost all these pipelines have a Nuget Restore task to restore all packages for the solution that runs before the MSBuild task that builds a specific set of projects. Our solution mostly contains C# projects (class libraries, ASP.NET Web apps, etc.) but it also has a couple \"non-standard\" projects, like a WiX installer project. Except for the non-standard projects, all projects use PackageReference for Nuget packages. Note that the WiX project has a packages.config file that just specifies the WiX package.\r\n\r\nThe pipeline is using a Microsoft-internal hosted agent pool.\r\n\r\nFor a while, our pipelines were using an older version of Nuget (3.0.0), but then we needed to move to a newer version of Nuget. However, once we did this our Nuget Restore task started failing.\r\n\r\nWe contacted the support for the hosted agent pool and together we were able to determine that:\r\n\r\n1. Nuget Restore throws an exception when it encounters a non-standard project type (like .wixproj). This causes the entire restore operation, for the entire solution, to fail.\r\n\r\n2. This only starts happening with Nuget 4.8.2. This doesn't happen with Nuget 4.7.3.\r\n\r\nWe can manage for now with Nuget 4.7.3, but if we need to move to a newer version in the future, we will be unable to until this gets resolved.\r\n\r\nHere's the exception (and a related warning) we're seeing during the nuget restore task when using Nuget 4.8.2+:\r\n```\r\nNuGet.CommandLine.ExitCodeException: Exception of type 'NuGet.CommandLine.ExitCodeException' was thrown. \r\nat NuGet.CommandLine.MsBuildUtility.<GetProjectReferencesAsync>d__6.MoveNext() \r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown --- \r\nat System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw() \r\nat System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task) \r\nat NuGet.CommandLine.RestoreCommand.<GetDependencyGraphSpecAsync>d__68.MoveNext() \r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown --- \r\nat System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw() \r\nat System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task) \r\nat NuGet.CommandLine.RestoreCommand.<DetermineInputsFromMSBuildAsync>d__63.MoveNext() \r\nWARNING: Error reading msbuild project information, ensure that your input solution or project file is valid.

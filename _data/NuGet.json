This change allows our team flexibility to switch to a back-up provider in the case that one CDN is down, which will broaden coverage for our users.\r\n\r\nSome changes are coming for older TLS cipher suites, which may result in connectivity issues. From our data we believe this will affect only a small percentage of requests. We will be monitoring all feedback channels during the migration to assess impact and adjust our roll-out timeline as needed.\r\n\r\nBelow, we provide resources to determine whether you will be affected by this change. This utilizes the [.NET CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to install a package from our pre-production (INT) environment which tests connectivity:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir cdn-test\r\ncd cdn-test\r\ndotnet new classlib\r\ndotnet add package BaseTestPackage.NetStandard --source https://apiint.nugettest.org/v3/index.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing connectivity issues while connecting to nuget.org or restoring packages from https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json, such as:\r\n\r\n\"The SSL connection could not be established\"\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that TLS 1.2 and any of the following cipher suites have been enabled on your machine:\r\n\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, do reach out to us at support@nuget.org or by commenting on the discussion issue: NuGet/Home#11058"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1631370937248481281","CreatedAt":"2023-03-02T19:08:35+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Your package's README is your chance to showcase your hard work and make a great first impression.

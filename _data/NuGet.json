When building and restoring that package, nuget audit will only evaluate the dependencies for `netstandard2.0`, however the package's dependencies might reference additional packages with vulnerabilities on compatible target frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis creates a \"blind spot\" for a library package author.  There's no signal that their package might raise audit warnings when consumed by users.\r\n\r\nOne way to handle this would be to tell NuGet to add restore passes for every distinct compatible target framework mentioned in the dependencies references.\r\n\r\nSo if the closure of package references for the `netstandard2.0` package also referenced `net47;net6.0;net8.0` then NuGet could tell the user this - or even automatically restore for those for the purpose of audit (but exclude from packing).\r\n\r\nI know this is a significant ask, and there is a workaround in that the library author could create a test project targeting every compatible framework, but I did want to raise this as it came up when I was working through enabling audit on a few repos.  I saw that the source a flagged dependency for a test was often a product library that wasn't flagged because it targeted older frameworks.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"41838866091","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-09-11T16:56:43","Actor":"ericstj","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13782","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Project argument should be optional to `nuget why`\" (#13782) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen running `nuget why` I always need to specify a project file.

Many other package managers, such as npm and cargo, automatically install the latest available version within a SemVer-compatible range for both top-level and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nI propose that NuGet offer developers an option to opt-in to a SemVer-compatible resolution. This would allow:\r\n\r\n- Automatic installation of the latest versions of dependencies that are compatible with a defined SemVer range.\r\n- Consistent behavior with other package managers that already follow this approach.\r\n- More predictable updates, ensuring smoother integration of transitive dependencies as well.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\n- Reduces the burden on developers to manually update packages while ensuring compatibility.\r\n- Addresses many of the common challenges related to dependency resolution in NuGet, improving developer experience.\r\n\r\nIn addition, new shorthand syntax such as `^X.Y.Z` would help with consistency of other paradigms.\r\n\r\nRelated to: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5553 (But starting a new issue as there are over a hundred comments and this is a clearer definition of what to do)\r\n\r\nExpectation:\r\n\r\nI can opt-in via some property like `<NuGetResolutionMode>` or `<EnableSemVerResolution>`\r\n\r\nI can use caret syntax ^ for SemVer compatible updates i.e. \r\n\r\n`<PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"^12.0.0\" />`\r\n\r\nI can use tilde syntax for minor version locking i.e.\r\n\r\n`<PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"~12.0.0\" />`\r\n\r\nI can use the existing range syntax for explicit range >=, <= i.e.\r\n\r\n`<PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"[12.0.0, 13.0.0)\" />`\r\n\r\nBehavior Expectation:\r\n\r\nTop-level and transitive dependencies should be updated within the allowed SemVer compatible ranges automatically.\r\n\r\nAny direct or transitive dependency within the defined SemVer range should be installed or updated to the latest compatible version when running `restore` or other nuget installation operations.\r\n\r\nIf users prefer to use the old behavior for compatibility reasons / exact versioning, they can do so by keeping the mode or disabling the property.\r\n\r\nPlease 👍 or 👎 this comment to help us with the direction of this feature & leave as much feedback/questions/concerns as you'd like on this issue itself and we will get back to you shortly.\r\n\r\nThank You 🎉"},{"Id":"41814108637","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-09-11T04:04:23","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13778","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Detect if restore used NuGetAudit or not\" (#13778) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nMSBuild.exe, dotnet.exe\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nEngineering teams responsible for CI build compliance may want to enforce that NuGetAudit runs during restore.

These tools packages are built in the same repo and produce a package that is target framework independent.  They are *not* dotnet tools.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, I have the following projects:\r\n\r\nParent.csproj:\r\n```<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.Build.NoTargets\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>\r\n    <IncludeBuildOutput>false</IncludeBuildOutput>\r\n    <PackageId>Parent.Package</PackageId>\r\n    <NoWarn>NU5128</NoWarn>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Child1\\Child1.csproj\" ReferenceOutputAssembly=\"true\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Child2\\Child2.csproj\" ReferenceOutputAssembly=\"true\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth Child.csproj projects look like the following:\r\n\r\n```<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net472</TargetFramework>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <AssemblyName>Child1</AssemblyName>\r\n    <PlatformTarget>AnyCPU</PlatformTarget>\r\n    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>\r\n    <IncludeBuildOutput>false</IncludeBuildOutput>\r\n    <NoWarn>NU5128</NoWarn>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  \r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Include=\"$(OutputPath)\\$(AssemblyName).exe\" PackagePath=\"tools\" Pack=\"true\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEXCEPT Child2.csproj targets net6.0 instead of net472.\r\n\r\nThe net6.0 target framework causes the following error: `error NU1201: Project Child2 is not compatible with netstandard2.0 (.NETStandard,Version=v2.0). Project Child2 supports: net6.0 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v6.0)`\r\n\r\nThis is confusing to me.  Netstandard2.0 is not compatible with BOTH net6.0 and net472.  However, only net6.0 throws the error?\r\n\r\nMy real goal is to add the project references as a dependency to the NuGet, ignoring the target framework being used to build the tools DLL.  Is this possible?\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"41791791031","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T13:18:17","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13773","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Saving PackageManagementFormat throws Nullable object must have a value.\" (#13773) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nVisual Studio Package Management UI, Visual Studio Package Manager Console\n\n### Product Version\n\nany\n\n### Worked before?\n\nno\n\n### Impact\n\nOther\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nWhen calling `ApplyChanges` on `PackageManagementFormat` settings , if the nullable property `_showDialogValue` is not set, the attempt to save settings to disk will fail.\r\n\r\n1.

404's and the leaf page ends up being null in the code here:

The easiest way to reproduce this is to pass a public certificate to `--certificate-path`.\r\n\r\nI don't know the best place to insert that check, but maybe somewhere around here:

The only difference between the builds is the following environment variables and they only differ by presence or absence of the trailing slash.\r\n\r\n| Name | Good Build | Failing Build |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| NUGET_PACKAGES | .packages\\ | .packages |\r\n| NuGetPackageRoot | .packages\\ | .packages\\ |\r\n\r\nWhen the two variables disagree on the trailing slash it causes a significant difference in how the `nuget.g.props` file is generated: \r\n\r\nGood case\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <NuGetPackageRoot Condition=\" '$(NuGetPackageRoot)' == '' \">E:\\temp\\nuget\\EditorConfigNugetRepro\\.packages\\</NuGetPackageRoot>\r\n    ...\r\n    <Compile Include=\"$(NuGetPackageRoot)nugetpackagewitheditorconfig\\1.0.0\\contentFiles\\cs\\netstandard2.0\\Class1.cs\" Condition=\"Exists('$(NuGetPackageRoot)\\nugetpackagewitheditorconfig\\1.0.0\\contentFiles\\cs\\netstandard2.0\\Class1.cs')\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nFailing case\r\n```xml\r\n    <NuGetPackageRoot Condition=\" '$(NuGetPackageRoot)' == '' \">E:\\temp\\nuget\\EditorConfigNugetRepro\\.packages</NuGetPackageRoot>\r\n    ...\r\n    <Compile Include=\"$(NuGetPackageRoot)\\nugetpackagewitheditorconfig\\1.0.0\\contentFiles\\cs\\netstandard2.0\\Class1.cs\" Condition=\"Exists('$(NuGetPackageRoot)\\nugetpackagewitheditorconfig\\1.0.0\\contentFiles\\cs\\netstandard2.0\\Class1.cs')\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that in the failing case the path of the content file is prefixed with `$(NuGetPackageRoot)\\`. That is a problem because  `$(NuGetPackageRoot)` has a trailing slash and the source file ends up with the file path \r\n\r\n> .packages\\\\nugetpackagewitheditorconfig\\1.0.0\\contentFiles\\cs\\netstandard2.0\\Class1.cs`packages\\\\nugetpackagewitheditorconfig\r\n\r\nThat double slash (`\\\\`) breaks .editorconfig semantics which is entirely path based. The file no longer resolves to being associated with the .editorconfig file and none of its settings are applied. This means .editorconfig is essentially ignored and the result is compilation errors.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72657\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/razor/pull/10220\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"37184074156","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-04-04T22:30:45","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10030","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Same projects targeting .NET Core restore slower than .NET Framework (.NET Core App dependencies have more packages)\" (#10030) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"---\r\n**Issue moved from dotnet/sdk#13538**\r\n- Please respond to @saul.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_From @saul on Friday, September 11, 2020 4:36:23 PM_\r\n\r\nHi\r\n\r\nWe're currently in the middle of migrating a large .NET Framework codebase (~350 projects) to .NET Core. Unfortunately we've hit a bit of a roadblock - the NuGet restore times have shot up from ~1:30m -> ~16:00m (an increase of 10x!)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't share the full solution as it is sensitive. However I have been able to create a representative solution outside of the office. This representative solution has the same number of projects, the same ProjectReferences and the same third-party PackageReferences. With this representative solution, here are my results:\r\n\r\n- .NET Framework restore time: 14s average\r\n- .NET Core restore time: 51s average\r\n\r\nNote that the only thing that has changed between .NET Framework and .NET Core is moving from `net471` -> `netcoreapp3.1`.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.

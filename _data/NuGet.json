However, the restore operation is still successful and no version downgrades are being reported.\r\n\r\n**Solution.sln:**\r\n```\r\nApp -> Lib1 {{Newtonsoft.Json 12.0.2}} -> Lib2 -> Newtonsoft.Json 12.0.2\r\n    -> Newtonsoft.Json 12.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of dotnet restore:**\r\n```\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n  The project _\\Lib1\\Lib1.csproj is using CentralPackageVersionManagement, a NuGet preview feature.\r\n  The project _\\App\\App.csproj is using CentralPackageVersionManagement, a NuGet preview feature.\r\n  Restored _\\Lib2\\Lib2.csproj (in 158 ms).\r\n  Restored _\\App\\App.csproj (in 158 ms).\r\n  Restored _\\Lib1\\Lib1.csproj (in 158 ms).\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of dotnet list package:**\r\n```\r\ndotnet list package\r\nProject 'App' has the following package references\r\n   [net5.0]:\r\n   Top-level Package      Requested   Resolved\r\n   > Newtonsoft.Json                  12.0.1\r\n\r\nProject 'Lib1' has the following package references\r\n   [net5.0]: No packages were found for this framework.\r\nProject 'Lib2' has the following package references\r\n   [net5.0]:\r\n   Top-level Package      Requested   Resolved\r\n   > Newtonsoft.Json      12.0.2      12.0.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**App:**\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>\r\n    <CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>true</CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Lib1\\Lib1.csproj\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Directory.Packages.props (App):**\r\n```\r\n<Project>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\t\t\r\n    <PackageVersion Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"12.0.1\"  />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Lib1:**\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>\r\n    <CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>true</CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Lib2\\Lib2.csproj\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Directory.Packages.props (Lib1):**\r\n```\r\n<Project>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\t\t\r\n    <PackageVersion Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"12.0.2\"  />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Lib2:**\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"12.0.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Attachements:**\r\n- [MissingDowngradeCentralisedLib.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/8521262/MissingDowngradeCentralisedLib.zip)\r\n\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"23390055850","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T16:55:30","Actor":"JonDouglas","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5887","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"PackRef does not show transitive dependencies - install tab & update tab behavior?\" (#5887) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"When using \"legacy\"-style `.csproj` project files we have a separate `packages.config` file where all dependencies are listed, including transitive ones. This allows a use case when one installs a package with dependencies and then decides which transitive dependencies can be manually updated. So, the benefits are:\r\n\r\n- Dependencies are easily identifiable due to presence of a flat list\r\n- Fine-grain control over all dependency versions\r\n\r\nThere are drawdowns of course: the flat list can blow up to a huge one.\r\n\r\nE.g., after installing Autofac.WebApi2.Owin from NuGet, we have a picture like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"873\" alt=\"whajk\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1358330/30423164-b3059094-994a-11e7-8d0c-86d723aa4913.png\">\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies which are clearly viewable can be manually updated very easily.\r\n\r\nWhen using the new Sdk-style .csproj projects NuGet references are added as `<PackageReference/>` to the project file itself and transitive dependencies are resolved by MSBuild automatically:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net462</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Autofac.WebApi2.Owin\" Version=\"4.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, to update transitive dependencies, one would have to\r\n\r\n1. Identify them (e.g. via obj/project.assets.json)\r\n2. Add all of them explicitly to the project\r\n3. Perform updates\r\n\r\nAnd this has to be done after each update and for every (!) transitive dependency in the project which is nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a \"regression\" to me.\r\n\r\nThe best possible resolution would be to show transitive dependency updates in NuGet GUI or via CLI. If the user decides to update one of the dependencies, it would get explicitly added to the project. (similar to https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3159)\r\n\r\nMaybe there is some workaround to achieve the specified behaviour?"},{"Id":"23379330648","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-08-11T07:58:10","Actor":"RVink","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12017","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: Author primary signing certificate not trusted when installing package through an Azure DevOps feed\" (#12017) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.0.400\n\n### Worked before?\n\n6.0.302\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me.

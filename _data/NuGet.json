I did this in one commit so that's it's a bit more obvious what's going on. \r\n\r\n- The CommonMark library has a weird bug that if a string begins with a BOM, it doesn't convert the first line properly. As a result I stripped it out and then it works ok. I've added a test for this. (It looks like the version of CommonMark used is old, and the package is also no longer supported, but that's another matter)\r\n\r\n- A few of the unit tests eg `PackageControllerFacts.TheDisplayPackageMethod.WhenHasReadMeAndMarkdownExists_ReturnsContent` test that the markdown -> html is working properly, but that's arguably not the concern of the PackageControllerFacts and are tested anyway, inside the MarkdownServiceFacts. However, in the interests of keeping things working I've changed the `PackageControllerFacts` to inject an instantiated `MarkdownService` instead of a Mock. However if someone wiser than me wishes to change it to test against a mock and not test for the MD -> HTML logic then that seems to make sense to me, but it depends on how pure we want the unit tests to be. \r\n\r\nAddresses #7975"},{"Id":"13798022566","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-10-09T23:44:02","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8253","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix accessibility bug in SelectRole, ChangeRole combo boxes labels\" (#8253) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Fix for #8193 \r\n\r\nFor repro details please refer to the issue.\r\nThe problem was that when narrator reaches those SelectRole, ChangeRole combo boxes it reads \r\n\"Select new member role combo box Administrator collapsed\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the requirements in https://w3c.github.io/wcag21/understanding/label-in-name.html\r\nWe need to \r\n\r\n> Ensure that visible labels match their accessible names\r\n\r\n> **The following are common mistakes that are considered failures of this Success Criterion by the WCAG Working Group.**\r\n> \r\n> Accessible name does not contain the visible label text\r\n> Accessible name contains the visible label text, but the words of the visible label are not in the same order as they are in the visible label text\r\n> Accessible name contains the visible label text, but one or more other words is interspersed in the label\r\n> Accessible name contains the visible label text, but one or more other words comes before the visible label text\r\n\r\nWith the new change the narrator will read: \"Administrator combo box collapsed\"\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16807822/95631911-604ced80-0a39-11eb-9515-6c48f7e4e0c3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"13798011481","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-10-09T23:41:33","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8255","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Log-out \"remembers\" last visited page and errors when logging in with an account that doesn't have access\" (#8255) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen logging out from an account, the login URL contains the link to the page last visited.

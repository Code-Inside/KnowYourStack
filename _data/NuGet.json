When this is set to `false`, we filter packages only by their asset frameworks, and only show asset framework badges. When this is set to `true`, we filter packages by asset frameworks + computed frameworks, and we show both types of badges as well.\r\n- **Framework Filter Mode**\r\n     Toggle that chooses between `All` and `Any` (default is `All`). This affects cases when multiple framework or TFM filters are selected. When this is set to `All`, we will show packages matching **all** the framework and TFM filters. If it is set to `Any`, we will show packages matching **any one of** the selected filters.\r\n\r\nThe changes are behind a feature flag.\r\n\r\nI ran Accessibility FastPass, and it didn't throw up any issues. I also checked color contrast for the new UI elements.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** I made an additional bug fix for the TFM badges in this PR. The TFM badges link to the frameworks tab on the package details page, but we weren't providing a package version, so the links sometimes took us to the wrong version's page.

Even if a solution-level config file exists, it will not write [Package Sources sections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file#package-source-sections) to it.\r\n\r\nIf a solution-level config exists with `<packageSources>` and the customer disables one of those sources using Visual Studio Options, the `<disabledPackageSources>` node will be created in the machine-wide config.\r\nHowever, if `<disabledPackageSources><clear/></disabledPackageSources>` exists in the solution-wide config then that section will be updated as expected.\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file#package-source-sections\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nSince customers are encouraged to follow this suggested best-practice anyway, I believe tooling should guide them by generating a solution `nuget.config` implementing those practices, unless the customer expresses otherwise.\r\n\r\nTo steer customers towards solution-level configs, the following workflow is suggested for NuGet Tooling (eg, VS Options or `dotnet new nugetconfig`) when that tooling attempts to write to a [Package Sources sections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file#package-source-sections). \r\n\r\n## VS Options\r\nWhen modifying any of the package sources sections, check the package source sections using the following workflow.\r\n\r\n1. Solution config exists? If not, create one.\r\n2. The node being modified exists (in solution config)? If not, create one with `<clear/>`.\r\n3. The node being modified exists (in solution config) but is missing a clear? Add a `<clear/>`.\r\n4. _Repeat 2-3 for all package sources sections._\r\n5. Write the actual change to the section.\r\n\r\nPrompt the customer if steps 1-4 find a missing ideal configuration. If the customer agrees, NuGet tooling completes steps 1-3 in the solution config for the customer. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, continue to step 5.\r\n\r\n## `dotnet new nugetconfig`\r\nCustomers using the `nuget.config` template without parameters will continue getting only the `<packageSource>` node from the package sources sections by default. Provide CLI options for appending the remaining package sources sections.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, these options should be available:\r\n`--add-package-source-mapping`\r\n`--add-disabled-sources`\r\n\r\nSecondarily, these options could be available:\r\n`--add-package-source-credentials`\r\n`--add-api-keys`\r\n`--add-active-package-source`\r\n`--add-trusted-signers`\r\n\r\nPotentially useful as well may be `--no-clear` in case customers intend to create a merged configuration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional Context\n\nFeature suggestion of a dotnet CLI config command: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9571\r\nSuggestion to stop creating default configs and/or prompt customers to use the `dotnet new nugetconfig`: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13027"},{"Id":"34974262924","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-19T22:01:45","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6705","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add support for trusted signers in VS UI\" (#6705) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Spec task: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6524"},{"Id":"34974172232","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-19T21:56:39","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6705","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add support for trusted signers in VS UI\" (#6705) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Spec task: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6524"},{"Id":"34973743270","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-19T21:31:59","Actor":"donnie-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4949","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Authentication issues for Restore with multi-feeds in nuget.config\" (#4949) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Till now, Following issues are identified:\r\n\r\n## Todo: \r\n[see Epic]\r\n\r\n## Completed:\r\n- [x] [Authentication] In multi-feed scenario, NuGet install does not honor the feed selected as package source in PM-UI#[5034](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5034)\r\n- [x] NuGet should install package from local cache even if disconnected from other feeds. #[5035](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5035)\r\n- [x] NuGet tries to repeatedly authenticate even when authentication fails or times out for one of the authentication feeds. https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5373\r\n- [x] NuGet does not remember password for custom feeds https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4615"},{"Id":"34973640147","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-19T21:26:20","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13172","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Test.Utility has too many dependencies\" (#13172) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Test.Utility depends on:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\src\\NuGet.Clients\\NuGet.CommandLine\\NuGet.CommandLine.csproj\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\src\\NuGet.Clients\\NuGet.PackageManagement.VisualStudio\\NuGet.PackageManagement.VisualStudio.csproj\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\src\\NuGet.Clients\\NuGet.VisualStudio.Common\\NuGet.VisualStudio.Common.csproj\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\src\\NuGet.Core\\NuGet.Commands\\NuGet.Commands.csproj\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\src\\NuGet.Core\\NuGet.Resolver\\NuGet.Resolver.csproj\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\src\\NuGet.Core\\NuGet.PackageManagement\\NuGet.PackageManagement.csproj\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is probably like 30 projects.\r\n\r\n NuGet.Versioning does not have any dependencies.\r\n\r\nNuGet.Versioning.Test for example, depends on Test.Utility, which effectively means, NuGet.Versioning.Test, depends on 31 projects. \r\n\r\nThis is unnecessary, and makes test running slower.\r\nWe need a better pattern than just having everything dependency on Test.Utility. \r\n\r\nIdeas:\r\n* Compile the utility code into every test project.\r\n* Break down the Test.Utility into more than 1 project. \r\n* Don't reference Test.Utility in every project.

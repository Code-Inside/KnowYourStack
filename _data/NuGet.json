We intend on distributing the application (or even using the application internally).\r\n\r\nNow according to the terms of MIT License, we must include the license file along with the application binaries we distribute. Here's what is general verbiage of this license:\r\n\r\n> The MIT License (MIT)\r\n> \r\n> Copyright © 2020 <copyright holders>\r\n> \r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n> \r\n> **The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software**.\r\n> \r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Some packages include them (e.g. NewtonSoft.JSON) while some don't.\r\n\r\nReading the specification of [`nuspec`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec) and especially the [`license`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#license) section, I am led to believe that the license file is embedded with the `nupkg` file. However some of the packages I inspected, I found that's not the case. I changed the extension of package file (from nupkg to zip) and unzipped the file but could not find the license file in there.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when we install the packages what does in the `bin` directory of the application (and eventually made to the application package) are just the binary files (dlls etc.) and not the license file.\r\n\r\nI am wondering how folks are dealing with this situation? \r\n\r\nAre they manually downloading the license file and including it as part of application so that the license file finds it way to the bin directory of the application? Or is there something else that is being done to stay compliant with the MIT license?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this would be highly appreciated."},{"Id":"12637466226","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-15T19:43:33","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7986","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Download count decreased for the VaultSharp package\" (#7986) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Bug Description\r\nThe download count for the VaultSharp package decreased in the last week, from 821,000 odd to 789,000 odd.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1.

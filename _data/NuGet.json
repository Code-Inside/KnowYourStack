The “Authors” is just an arbitrary string that could be filled in with anything. From trust perspective as a package consumer what I really want to know is who the ‘Owners’ or publishers of the package are.\n\nFor example if you look up the Xerces package in Visual Studio you see it says ‘The Apache Software Foundation’. I might think oh great it looks like it is published by the owner of the library. However if you actually go to the NuGet.org site and look at the package the owner is someone completely different, Kikuchi. From a package trusting perspective this is bad. I need to see front and center who the owner of the package is, since the author is just a meaningless string that could contain any value.\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"9355935007","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-04-01T18:05:43","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/34","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"nuget list & add commands are being deprecated in 5.0\" (#34) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Tracking Issue(s):\r\n* Deprecate ambiguous nuget.exe commands in 5.0 [#7753](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7753)\r\n  * Deprecate nuget.exe add command [#7923](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7923)\r\n  * Rename nuget.exe list to nuget.exe search [#7912](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7912)\r\n\r\nThe following commands are being deprecated because these are cause of confusion due to their nomenclature and/or other related commands that already exist:\r\n* [`nuget list`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/cli-ref-list): Currently displays a list of packages from a given source\r\n  * This will be replaced by an equivalent command **`nuget search`** which will be later enhanced with more capabilities as we make progress with or [search improvements](nvmd got it: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/6371​​​​​​​).\r\n* [`nuget add`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/cli-ref-add): Currently adds a specified package to a non-HTTP package source (a folder or UNC path) in a hierarchical layout, wherein folders are created for the package ID and version number. \r\n  * This will be replaced by overloading **`nuget push`** command.\r\n\r\n> These commands will be deprecated i.e. there will be a warning on usage of these commands in 5.0 so that in future releases these commands can be discontinued."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1124053944269983745","CreatedAt":"2019-05-02T20:51:58+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfvqkS is currently degraded and some pages might take too long to load.

However, in the interests of keeping things working I've changed the `PackageControllerFacts` to inject an instantiated `MarkdownService` instead of a Mock. However if someone wiser than me wishes to change it to test against a mock and not test for the MD -> HTML logic then that seems to make sense to me, but it depends on how pure we want the unit tests to be. \r\n\r\nAddresses #7975"},{"Id":"13173581566","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T20:36:18","Actor":"ryuyu","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8152","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[A11y]Reset button for advanced search filtering does not have sufficient contrast\" (#8152) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11051729/89946316-94da2f80-dbd7-11ea-82c5-21c0a815589a.png)\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"13185833637","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-12T22:20:46","Actor":"lovettchris","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9902","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"New error from dotnet pack regarding DotnetToolSettings.xml starting with .NET SDK 3.1.401\" (#9902) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Remove the content above here and fill out details below.\r\n\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nSDK version 3.1.301, our nuget pack command worked fine.

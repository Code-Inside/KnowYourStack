There seems to be no ordering for quality of match with the package name or anything that would make it reasonable to find the package to install it in my current project.  For my example search, the Newtonsoft.Json package I was searching for was result number 656 in the list returned.  This makes the tool virtually unusable and I have resorted to using nuget.org to find the packages/versions and manually editing the csproj files rather than wasting my time trying to find them in this tool.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 7/2/2020, 07:06 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

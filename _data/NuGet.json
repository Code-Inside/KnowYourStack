I maintain an [OpenSSH distribution](https://github.com/Devolutions/openssh-distro) for which the 'ssh' executable is included in the [Devolutions.OpenSSH.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Devolutions.OpenSSH.Client/9.5.0.1) nuget package we import into Remote Desktop Manager (.NET application) for Windows, macOS and Linux. Since nuget does not retain the unix file permissions properly when imported, we have to manually fix the file permissions locally with chmod commands. In the past, we've wasted a lot of time writing special .targets files that would call chmod commands, now we've switched to doing it in the CI environment. Either way, it's very annoying that nuget is currently not capable of just packaging files that will properly retain the correct unix file permissions when imported, forcing us to resort to less-than-desirable solutions.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this issue, simply import [Devolutions.OpenSSH.Client versions 9.5.0.1 from nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Devolutions.OpenSSH.Client/9.5.0.1), and look at the imported file permissions on the 'ssh' executables in the local nuget package cache:\r\n\r\n![GJSQLByW4AAL4f5](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/assets/295841/f2226f37-c8d0-4c6d-a450-59b7cac1a242)\r\n\r\nNow download [the raw .nupkg file](https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Devolutions.OpenSSH.Client/9.5.0.1), change the extension to .zip and unzip it with the 'unzip' command on Linux, or even inspect its contents with 7-Zip or NanaZip on Windows without extracting it. All other zip tools I've tried correctly decode the zip file permissions on the 'ssh' executables contained within the .nupkg file, and restore them properly when unzipping on a non-Windows (Linux, macOS) file system.\r\n\r\nThere are various related issues ([main issue](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4424)) but they're not clearly scoped to zip file permissions when importing packages, and reading them, one could think it's an issue that's been fixed years ago when it clearly hasn't been fixed, and probably has never worked properly.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n### NuGet & NuGet Packages\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier.\r\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/security/advisories/GHSA-68w7-72jg-6qpp)\r\n\r\n\r\n### .NET SDK(s)\r\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\r\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a NuGet package or .NET SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.

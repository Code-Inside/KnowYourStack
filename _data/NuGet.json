Microsoft.Data.SqlClient not restoring from Global NuGet Cache - 1.0.19249.1](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/236) for full history that led to this issue.\r\n\r\n`runtime.native.System.Data.SqlClient.sni` 4.4.0 was missing from [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\NuGetFallbackFolder](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/%5BSpec%5D-Fallback-package-folders) in my offline environment.\r\n\r\nThis pre-built package is a dependency for `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, so to repro, remove the above pre-built package from the `NuGetFallbackFolder` on a machine with no internet connection and run the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet new classlib -f netcoreapp3.0 -o {ProjectName}\r\ncd {ProjectName}\r\n\r\n// For error message\r\ndotnet build\r\n\r\n// For restore warning\r\ndotnet restore -s

it was searched for. In order to guide the user towards how to remedy the missing dependency, something similar to the following could be appended as a third line to the current error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100\\Nuget.targets : error :\r\n{dependency} could not be located in {sources}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would give an indication as to how to fix build issues in a disconnected environment.\r\n\r\n**Offline Restore Warning Messages**  \r\nThe current warning message already indicates the package that was missing, as well as an approximate best match. In order to guide the user towards how to remedy the missing dependency, adding the location the package is missing from to the warning would be helpful.

I don't see binding redirect added to Console Application, only the Portable Library.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYes I'm talking about the ConsoleApplication. The binding redirects in the portable library project are expected, and do not affect runtime behavior (as the app.config is ignored and not copied to the app project), and hence can't cause an application to crash.\r\n\r\nI've found another repro (NuGet has really weird logic around when it decides to add binding redirects so it was hard to find a repro).\r\n\r\nThe repro is instead of using the Microsoft.Bcl package, install the Microsoft.Net.Http, 2.2.3-beta package. Make sure you are targeting __4.5__ from the ConsoleApplication and the exact platforms that I called out above for portable.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, the ConsoleApplication must be referencing the portable project before installing the package.  \r\n2013-06-13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK now I can repro  \r\n2013-06-14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK, I've got a fix now. It no longer adds the binding redirect for System.Runtime.dll, but still adds one for System.Net.Http.Primitives. I guess it's expected, right? Please confirm.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\">\r\n<dependentAssembly>\r\n<assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Net.Http.Primitives\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n<bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-4.2.3.0\" newVersion=\"4.2.3.0\" />\r\n</dependentAssembly>\r\n</assemblyBinding>\r\n```  \r\n2013-06-14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nYes that's correct. System.Net.Http.Primitives does not exist in the framework.  \r\n2013-06-14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixed in changeset b8d515f6341193b970d2a9d837e580e762d2eb71  \r\n2013-06-19\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ni get the same issue with my test project still, runtime being added... if i comment this out the tests run fine... if not i get exceptions thrown from json.net  \r\n2013-08-09\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(or i can change the version up to 4.0.0.0 or something and it works)  \r\n2013-08-09"},{"Id":"10105705706","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-29T18:41:10","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/35","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Machine readable output for dotnet list package\" (#35) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec for 'Machine readable output for dotnet list package' is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|----------|------------------|\r\n|[Machine readable output for dotnet list package](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/%5BSpec%5D-Machine-readable-output-for-dotnet-list-package) | https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7752 |"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1164220617710686209","CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T17:00:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"⚠ Restoring packages from https://t.co/KVB7werYQh might fail in some regions.

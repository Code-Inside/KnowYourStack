This means that once a user has selected a tab, they must still tab navigate through the remaining inactive tabs before they can access the tab content.\r\n\r\n**Previously,**\r\n![20220325_182528](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82980589/160219270-24b3d6af-42ae-484e-a867-cbae22dbc822.gif)\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\n\r\nI added an event listener for left and right arrow keys, and changed the tab in focus based on the input. I used keyUp as the trigger here rather than keyDown, because adding an event listener for keyDown also messed with other keyboard functionality (eg. 'tab' and 'enter' keys) when focused on the tab element.\r\n\r\nTo enable this, I also made it such that only the selected/expanded tab has _tabindex=\"0\"_ and receives tab focus sequentially with other elements on the page, while all inactive tabs have _tabindex=\"-1\"_, and can only receive focus when using left/right arrow keys from their active sibling tab. Once a new tab is made active, we set _tabindex=\"-1\"_ on the previous tab, and _tabindex=\"0\"_ on the new active tab.\r\n\r\n**After the changes,**\r\n![20220325_181409](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82980589/160219028-f8bd7c95-7efc-410a-8d32-3140726d749d.gif)"},{"Id":"20982767661","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T21:52:05","Actor":"ryuyu","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9074","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[A11y]Enable dismissing Verified tooltip with esc\" (#9074) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Currently, when navigated to by keyboard, the verified tooltip cannot be dismissed without tabbing away from the icon.\r\nThis change enables dismissing this tooltip by usage of the esc key for all locations where this tooltip is used.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus it also fixes a bug that could cause the tooltip to stop working altogether when clicked on."},{"Id":"20982504674","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T21:32:10","Actor":"agr","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9078","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Reduce the amount of magic numbers in JS code in Gallery\" (#9078) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Gallery JS code is ridden with magic numbers:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L12\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L244\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/common.js#L574-L578\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/6136fc988f19595bf1bbf96d0be7343e77e1a31a/src/NuGetGallery/Scripts/gallery/autocomplete.js#L64-L67\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFor better code readability it would be nice to provide nice names at least for some of them (key codes, for example).

Which as I interpret it as possible optimization that Credential provider can do based on this information.\r\n\r\nBut for `The Azure Artifacts Credential Provider` it has very different meaning:\r\n```\r\nIf false / unset, INVALID CREDENTIALS MAY BE RETURNED. The caller is required to validate returned credentials themselves, and if invalid, should call the credential provider again with -IsRetry set. If true, the credential provider will obtain new credentials instead of returning potentially invalid credentials from the cache.\"\r\n```\r\nThis is CLI parameter that is passed into GetAuthenticationCredentialsRequest constructor [here](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider/blob/master/CredentialProvider.Microsoft/Program.cs#L200).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis `IsRetry` property is used only once as far as I can tell [here](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider/blob/cdc427e8236212b33041b4276961855b39bbe98d/CredentialProvider.Microsoft/RequestHandlers/GetAuthenticationCredentialsRequestHandler.cs#L146). Which is stating:\r\n```\r\nInvalidating SessionToken cache for {0}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will be 2 step fix I guess:\r\n1) Write documentation for `IsRetry` property\r\n2) Fix one of the callers to use it correctly according to new documentation.\r\n\r\nThis came up here: https://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues/4278\r\nWhere we make 2 requests...\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"20984324465","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-29T00:16:25","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11697","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Feature]: Ability to specify relative path on nuget push\" (#11697) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\nNuGet.exe\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nI propose adding another parameter (and perhaps configuration option) to `nuget push`.  This parameter (perhaps `-DestinationRelativePath` or similar) would allow use of the `-Source` parameter to specify a configured Package Source, and then the remainder of the PUT request would be built by concatenating the package source and the value of the `DestinationRelativePath`.  So if one's Package Source called `MyNuGetSource` was configured with the URL `https://mynugetserver.com/api/nuget/v3/my-nuget-repo` and one executed the following:\r\n\r\n`nuget push MyPackage.nupkg -Source MyNuGetSource` -DestinationRelativePath MyPackage/1.1`\r\nThe eventual PUT request would be to `https://mynugetserver.com/api/nuget/v3/my-nuget-repo/MyPackage/1.1/MyPackage.nupkg`\r\n\r\nNuGet would still use the credentials specified for the `MyNugetSource` Package Source, including any stored credentials and client certificate information.  Currently this is impossible with regard to client certificates.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nNuGet push allows pushing to any arbitrary NuGet repository URL using the `-Source` parameter.  Alternately, the NuGet CLI can store configuration for a given Package Source, including authentication information (username/password, client certificates, etc).  However, **if one attempts to push to a location that is a sub-path of an existing configured Package Source, NuGet is unable to recognize this and use the configuration for that Package Source**.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have configured a Package Source called MySource as follows:\r\n`<add key=\"MyNuGetSource\" value=\"https://mynugetserver.com/api/nuget/v3/my-nuget-repo\"/>`\r\nand I then attempt to perform the following:\r\n`nuget push myPackage.nupkg -Source https://mynugetserver.com/api/nuget/v3/my-nuget-repo/subDir1/subDir2`, the NuGet CLI does not recognize that this is a subPath of my configured `MyNugetSource` source, and thus will prompt for credentials if the server side requires authentication.  This can be an issue for automated builds, though credential providers could theoretically work around this issue, or one could pass an apiKey on the command line.  What cannot be worked around is if the server requires client certificate authorization, since those options can only be specified in the NuGet config file, and not on the command line.\r\n\r\nWhy might one want to use a relative path in the nuget push?  One reason is if their repository target doesn't function the way NuGet.Server does.  NuGet.Server will create an appropriate folder structure and place the pushed package into the correct location within it.  For example, in Artifactory NuGet repos, a simple `nuget push` will result in the package being dropped into the root of the repository.  For large repos, this can be troublesome."},{"Id":"20984264550","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-03-29T00:09:43","Actor":"heng-liu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11695","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Feature]: `dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive` should return dependency path to vulnerable package\" (#11695) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Involved\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nWhen `dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive` reports packages that are indirect (transitive) dependencies it's very tedious to manually track down which direct dependency causes the vulnerable package to be included.

This parameter (perhaps `-DestinationRelativePath` or similar) would allow use of the `-Source` parameter to specify a configured Package Source, and then the remainder of the PUT request would be built by concatenating the package source and the value of the `DestinationRelativePath`.  So if one's Package Source called `MyNuGetSource` was configured with the URL `https://mynugetserver.com/api/nuget/v3/my-nuget-repo` and one executed the following:\r\n\r\n`nuget push MyPackage.nupkg -Source MyNuGetSource` -DestinationRelativePath MyPackage/1.1`\r\nThe eventual PUT request would be to `https://mynugetserver.com/api/nuget/v3/my-nuget-repo/MyPackage/1.1/MyPackage.nupkg`\r\n\r\nNuGet would still use the credentials specified for the `MyNugetSource` Package Source, including any stored credentials and client certificate information.  Currently this is impossible with regard to client certificates.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nNuGet push allows pushing to any arbitrary NuGet repository URL using the `-Source` parameter.  Alternately, the NuGet CLI can store configuration for a given Package Source, including authentication information (username/password, client certificates, etc).  However, **if one attempts to push to a location that is a sub-path of an existing configured Package Source, NuGet is unable to recognize this and use the configuration for that Package Source**.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have configured a Package Source called MySource as follows:\r\n`<add key=\"MyNuGetSource\" value=\"https://mynugetserver.com/api/nuget/v3/my-nuget-repo\"/>`\r\nand I then attempt to perform the following:\r\n`nuget push myPackage.nupkg -Source https://mynugetserver.com/api/nuget/v3/my-nuget-repo/subDir1/subDir2`, the NuGet CLI does not recognize that this is a subPath of my configured `MyNugetSource` source, and thus will prompt for credentials if the server side requires authentication.  This can be an issue for automated builds, though credential providers could theoretically work around this issue, or one could pass an apiKey on the command line.  What cannot be worked around is if the server requires client certificate authorization, since those options can only be specified in the NuGet config file, and not on the command line.\r\n\r\nWhy might one want to use a relative path in the nuget push?  One reason is if their repository target doesn't function the way NuGet.Server does.  NuGet.Server will create an appropriate folder structure and place the pushed package into the correct location within it.  For example, in Artifactory NuGet repos, a simple `nuget push` will result in the package being dropped into the root of the repository.  For large repos, this can be troublesome."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"20398585964","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-22T18:32:01","Actor":"clairernovotny","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/61","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Requiring two-factor authentication on NuGet.org\" (#61) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"We announced plans to require tFA on all accounts on NuGet.org.

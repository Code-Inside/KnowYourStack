Also, there are several project dependencies between the various projects. Therefore, we need to upgrade everything all at once.\r\n\r\nHowever, instead of having a clean upgrade process, we keep getting `Detected package downgrade` errors, regardless of which \"Install and **Update** Options\" we pick. And the note: \r\n```These options are not applicable to projects managing their dependencies through project.json or PackageReference```\r\n\r\nThis makes no sense since all of our projects use PackageReferences. So, when do these options apply then? \r\n\r\nExample of the error message, and thus the bug:\r\n```\r\nNU1605: Detected package downgrade: F from 9.5.4-b001-Debug to 9.5.4-a015-Debug. \r\nReference the package directly from the project to select a different version. \r\n A -> B -> C -> D -> E 9.5.4-b001-Debug -> F (>= 9.5.4-b001-Debug) \r\n A -> B -> F (>= 9.5.4-a015-Debug)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst issue: the message \"Reference the package directly from the **project** to select a different version.\" \r\n\r\nWhich project? We have 187 of them. Therefore, this message should be changed to specify which project.\r\n\r\nMain Issue:\r\n1. The upgrade rules clearly state that `B` can use any version of `F` that is greater than or equal to `9.5.4-a015-Debug`\r\n2. According to [semver 2.0](https://semver.org/#spec-item-11) sections 11.4.2 & 11.4.4, (assuming we have read the spec correctly) state that the version number `9.5.4-b*` is greater than `9.5.4-a*`.\r\n3. Therefore, `F 9.5.4-b001-Debug` is greater than `F 9.5.4-a015-Debug` which satisfies the upgrade rule (see item 1 above.)\r\n\r\nThus this package should **not** be downgraded.\r\n\r\nThis behavior also suggests that the Nuget Manager is not following the solution's build dependencies, otherwise `B` would have been upgraded before `A` and this issue would not have existed in the first place.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"21481742163","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-26T18:26:54","Actor":"MisinformedDNA","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11776","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: RestoreLockedMode fails when overriding reference from Directory.Builds.prop\" (#11776) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Product Version\n\n6.0.202\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\n_No response_\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\n1.

These are all good indicators but sometimes are hard to trace to the root cause.\r\n\r\nOne example we've noticed that's exceptionally hard for folks to identify is eclipsed packages.  NuGet will download packages in the graph if it cannot \"know\" at the time of the download if that package will eventually win or not.  These packages will appear in a local packages folder and *could* be used by the repository, so they are flagged by component governance.\r\n\r\nTake one example which we hit in some dotnet repositories.  Imagine package C1 is vulnerable and flagged by component governance.\r\n```\r\nProject > A > B1 > C1\r\nProject > D > B2 > C2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case there is nothing inside the repository's intermediates that tells the repo owner \"why\" NuGet downloaded C1.  They could find the reference in other packages downloaded and try to walk back up to some package which does appear in intermediate assets files, but that's a ton of work and not really feasible for the majority of our users.\r\n\r\nCan we make it *crystal clear* why a package was downloaded?  Potentially through opt-in tracing?  NuGet knows this information and can make it available through some simple logging.  Doing so would save repo owners everywhere many hours of time and make the ecosystem better by helping folks make more educated decisions in their repos around dismissing issues, working around them, or asking dependencies to update.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"21520348504","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-28T13:43:44","Actor":"cosminstirbu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11781","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[DCR]: dotnet list package --outdated exit code\" (#11781) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product(s) Affected\n\ndotnet.exe\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWe'd like to check for outdated packages as part of our PR pipeline.\r\n\r\nWe would like to use `dotnet list package --outdated`, however there is no way to tell (without parsing the output), if there are any outdated packages.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to opt into returning a non-zero exit code if there are outdated packages, so we can then fail our pipeline / report on it?\r\n\r\n\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nHave an additional argument to `dotnet list package --outdated` to have it return a non-zero exit code if there are outdated packages (e.g., then number of outdated packages)\n\n### Additional Context\n\nOriginal issue https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/25091\r\n\r\nWe're currently using [dotnet-outdated/dotnet-outdated](https://github.com/dotnet-outdated/dotnet-outdated), however sometimes it is a hit or miss, because it fails to load the .sln."},{"Id":"21510560993","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-28T03:41:29","Actor":"kalirajanganeshan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11780","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug]: NuGet API return Blob was not found\" (#11780) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\n\nOther/NA\n\n### Product Version\n\nSyncfusion Blazor Version API\n\n### Worked before?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Impact\n\n_No response_\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nWe try to get the versions of our package using following NuGet API.

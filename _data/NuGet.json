before?\n\nYes, 5.x\n\n### Impact\n\nIt bothers me. A fix would be nice\n\n### Repro Steps & Context\n\nMSBuild will evaluate in-memory projects and ask SDK resolvers to resolve paths to SDKs.  In previous versions of MSBuild, a context is passed with a `null` value for the path to the project and the NuGet SDK resolver would throw an exception.  However, MSBuild would consider this non-fatal, log a warning, and try the next resolver.  In MSBuild 17.0, this logic changed to consider this scenario fatal and fail evaluation.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7035\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1458922810328371207","CreatedAt":"2021-11-11T22:21:18+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Hi friends 👋\n\nHelp us deliver an amazing target framework filtering package search experience by reviewing our prop… https://t.co/AYWrsHhZcZ","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1457785562614493192","CreatedAt":"2021-11-08T19:02:17+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🚢 Announcing #NuGet 6.0! \n \n📍 Source mapping\n6️⃣ .NET 6 Support\n🔒 Package Vulnerabilities\n🧑‍🔬 Retry &amp; Backoff Behav… https://t.co/qIK6tRSw87","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":162,"FavoriteCount":61,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1448351779423457281","CreatedAt":"2021-10-13T18:15:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Help us understand your package push workflow! https://t.co/7zALBMJ0xH","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":1,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1438283829102456833","CreatedAt":"2021-09-15T23:29:21+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"🙌New feature announcement🙌\n\nMap packages to target sources using Package Source Mapping 🗺️\n\nSecuring your package s… https://t.co/UCSO5dcMpz","Source":"<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>","RetweetCount":68,"FavoriteCount":30,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1417880494994198529","CreatedAt":"2021-07-21T16:13:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi will be migrating towards a new multi-CDN infrastructure.

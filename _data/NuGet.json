This is not specific to a particular version of Windows.\r\n\r\nWorked before? If so, with which NuGet version: No\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1. Locate or create a NuGet package whose version can be normalized (eg. Owin 1.0 can normalize to Owin 1.0.0). Legacy packages with 4-number versioning and a trailing 0 also apply (Foo 1.2.3.0 normalize to Foo 1.2.3). Azure DevOps (ADO) may also have some packages with extraneous 0's such as Package.1.2.01 instead of the normalized Package.1.2.1.\r\n\r\n2. Generate the .nupkg.sha512 file, or use the corresponding file from the user's global-cache if the package was downloaded via NuGet\r\n\r\n3. Place the .nupkg, .nupkg.sha512, and .nuspec files into a directory (eg. C:\\Test) following the V3 cache format (eg. C:\\Test\\Owin\\1.0.0\\<files>). If the package was downloaded via NuGet, using the global-cache directory or copying its contents will suffice.\r\n\r\n4. De-normalize the nupkg and nupkg.sha512 file names (eg. make them Owin.1.0.nupkg and Owin.1.0.nupkg.sha512)\r\n\r\n5. Generate a packages.config requesting the test package. It does not matter if the version is normalized or not (ie. requesting 1.0 and 1.0.0 will both reproduce this issue)\r\n\r\n6. Add the test directory from step 3 as a NuGet source. Preferably, remove all other package sources from nuget.config (or generate a new nuget.config).\r\n\r\n7. Run nuget restore <your-packages.config> -OutputDirectory <somewhere> -NoCache\r\n\r\nThe NoCache flag is to avoid finding the package in the user's global-cache. Omit the flag if using the global cache as the test directory in step 3.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: nuget locates and restores the package.\r\nActual behavior: nuget does not locate the nupkg and does not restore the package.\r\n\r\n## Other suggested things\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- nuget will successfully restore the package if the source is not using the hierarchical folder structure (eg. C:\\Test\\Owin.1.0.nupkg instead of C:\\Test\\Owin\\1.0.0\\Owin.1.0.nupkg) and will do so regardless of mismatch between nupkg name and the version requested in packages.config\r\n- When restoring a package nuget will place the nupkg on disk as the remote sends it but will always normalize the nupkg in the user's global cache. For example, If ADO or nuget.org send Owin.1.0.nupkg, nuget will place Owin.1.0.nupkg in the destination but place Owin.1.0.0.nupkg and Owin.1.0.0.nupkg.sha512 in %HOMEDIR%\\.nuget\\packages\r\n- Our use case is that we take the package downloaded by nuget and propagate it to other machines to avoid sending requests to ADO packaging feeds.\r\n\r\nPer discussion with @rrelyea, there are four potential paths to fixing this:\r\n1. Fix the packages when we propagate them to have normalized versions in their file names.\r\n2a. Fix nuget to normalize nupkg files in the destination location\r\n2b. Make nuget check for non-normalized nupkgs when traversing a hierarchical source\r\n3. If nuget.org always returns normalized nupkgs, fix ADO to also return normalized nupkgs\r\n4.

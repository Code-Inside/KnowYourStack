A network hiccup causes the whole upload to restart even if the upload was 99% complete. This is particularly problematic as:\r\n\r\n* nuget.org's upload services are in North America. Customers in locations like China experience high amounts of slow or failed requires. _⚠ TODO: Quantify this with data_\r\n* NuGet packages can be up to 250mb. Large uploads have a higher probability of failure. _⚠ TODO: Quantify this with data_\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\n\nSee: http://highscalability.com/blog/2016/4/20/how-twitter-handles-3000-images-per-second.html\r\n\r\nNuGet could divide packages into segments and append each segment to the upload.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine I want to upload a 1mb package. Here's what this could look like using segmented resumable uploads:\r\n\r\n1. I split my package into four segments of 256KB.\r\n2. I upload the first segment to nuget.org and receive an upload ID `x`\r\n3. I append the second segment to nuget.org using upload ID `x` \r\n4. I append the third segment to nuget.org using upload ID `x`\r\n5. I attempt to append the fourth segment to nuget.org using upload ID `x`. Let's say this fails\r\n6. I retry and append the fourth segment to nuget.org using upload ID `x`. This completes my upload\r\n\r\nThis may be useful to prevent denial of service attacks.\n\n### Additional Context and Details\n\nTODO:\r\n\r\n* [ ] Determine need using data\r\n* [ ] Research how other services implement segmented resumable uploads"},{"Id":"19510151888","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-12-28T20:02:09","Actor":"lyndaidaii","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8914","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Table style with background\" (#8914) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Summary of the changes (in less than 80 characters):\r\n\r\nMake table pretty similar to Github table style:\r\n\r\nupload preview page: \r\n![readmeupload](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64443925/147602779-005668bc-edcf-4ed1-b51d-ea31fdce85e9.png)\r\nmanage page: \r\n![readmeManage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64443925/147602790-9a04ce0b-b5ce-4d31-af8d-100776cc68dd.png)\r\npackage detail page: \r\n![readmeShow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64443925/147602794-0ca753be-0426-4201-900e-6a9cac136161.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAddresses:"},{"Id":"19457193039","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-12-23T01:20:10","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8913","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[NuGet.org Bug]: Some problems with README Markdown rendering\" (#8913) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Impact\r\n\r\nIt bothers me.

So the global.json file is in the same directory as the project, but in the Visual Studio case the default creation case is to create a solution folder and a project sub-folder. The project sub-folder contains the global.json file in this case. The MSBuild NuGet SDK Resolver fails to locate the global.json file in the project folder.\r\n\r\nThe issue was trigger by this [#4380](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4380) I believe. There was a subsequent bug and a change with this [#4507](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/4507).\r\n\r\nThat secondary change almost fixes the issue for me, but unfortunately it does not handle the case when the resolver context defines both a solution and project. The existing [code](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver/GlobalJsonReader.cs#L100) means the solution always wins even if the project is set. The consequence is that a global.json in the project folder is not found. I believe a change to check the project file path context first would resolve this problem.\n\n### Verbose Logs\n\n_No response_"},{"Id":"21341148536","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-18T20:24:34","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11724","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: No way to suppress very noisy \"The project ... is using CentralPackageVersionManagement, a NuGet preview feature.\"\" (#11724) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet Product Used\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe\r\n\r\n### Product Version\r\n\r\n6.0.200\r\n\r\n### Worked before?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt bothers me.

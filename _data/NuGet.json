A fix would be nice\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n## TL/DR\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the download counter is not working for versions of packages that are marked as pre-release.\r\n\r\nThe total download for a package that has pre-release versions but also \"normal\" versions seems to work fine, even though each pre-release version is stuck at 0 (zero).\r\n\r\nPlease note that the usual delay of 24/48h for the stats to be updated is already passed, since we are at around 6 days.\r\nAlso, in these 6 days the other downloads seem to have been updated just fine: I'm talking about my **global** downloads, the downloads for each **package as a whole**, and the downloads for each **package version** that is NOT a pre-release version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The setup\r\n\r\nUp until last week I had 3 packages on nuget.org , all of them had some versions released in the last year, and none of those versions were pre-release (per semantic versioning).\r\n\r\nAll was fine.\r\n\r\nLast week (Jan 27th to be precise) I uploaded 2 completely new packages (both with a pre-release version) and 3 new versions (again, all pre-release) of the 3 existing packages.\r\nSo all of these were in \"alpha1\" version.\r\nThen about 3 days after that i pushed another pre-release version (\"alpha2\") for all of the 5 packages.\r\n\r\nYou can see all 5 of them [here](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/jodydonetti) (screenshot taken 2022-02-02):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1010086/152252639-1d57cb56-60c9-4d44-8e71-c5548df49e88.png)\r\n\r\n(Now don't be fooled by the 0.1.9 you can see as the \"Latest version\" for the first 3 packages, since what is shown is the latest non-pre-release version, as I'm sure you know)\r\n\r\nSo, all these packages have an actual last version that is pre-release (currently \"alpha2\").\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nThe problem is that since then, the download counters for each pre-releae version remained stuck at 0 (zero), even though me and other people already downloaded them.\r\n\r\nSee screenshots below for some evidence.\n\n### Repro Steps\n\nHypothetically:\r\n- upload a new pre-release version of an existing package OR upload a completely new package (with a pre-release version)\r\n- make some downloads\r\n- wait a couple of days\r\n- download stats will not increase\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDownload stats SHOULD increase.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n## New package\r\n\r\nDownloads for one of the new packages ([this](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache.Backplane.StackExchangeRedis/0.1.0-alpha2)) after 6 days:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1010086/152254941-84a73ae1-4146-495c-8c6a-8de0828ef696.png)\r\n\r\n## Existing package\r\n\r\nDownloads for one of the existing packages ([this](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache/0.1.9)) after 6 days:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1010086/152255046-23f4fcda-e4cc-4c13-957e-a64710c3129f.png)\r\n\r\nNote that as, I said above, in the last 6 days the downloads for the v0.1.9 kept increasing.\n\n### Additional Context and logs\n\n_No response_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"20119477364","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-07T23:44:22","Actor":"erdembayar","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11573","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package source mapping should check for duplicate node keys\" (#11573) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"If you following setup then you'll get `dotnet` source not considered for `Microsoft.Somepackage` error during restore,\nproblem is there 2 nodes with same `dotnet` key so last one overwrites the first one.

It sorted lexicographically rather than understanding the package versioning schema for beta releases.\r\n\r\nAs an example, RazorLight2.0.0-beta9 comes above RazorLight2.0.0-beta10.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open web browser (mine is Chrome)\r\n2. Go to https://www.nuget.org/packages/RazorLight\r\n3. Expand \"Version History\" accordion control\r\n4. Observe that it sorts packages by major version number, but when you use prerelease suffixes, the sorting breaks.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nWhy not just sort it by last updated date?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/447485/99278405-fde7c980-27fc-11eb-9f09-a391ea63c2b2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/prerelease-packages#semantic-versioning implies that `-alpha`, `-beta`, and `-rc` are well known pre-release tags, so it seems natural to expect these pre-release tags to also include version numbers and that these suffix version numbers to sort correctly.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that for packages like [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/), where the major versions cross from 9 to 10, the major.minor.patch convention sorts correctly, so it seems like the issue is confined to just pre-release tags.  I realize pre-release tags can be any value, but the nuget docs literally suggest sticking with `-alpha`, `-beta`, and `-rc`"},{"Id":"14214492991","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-17T05:23:20","Actor":"lyndaidaii","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/8322","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"scroll ui\" (#8322) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Not ready for review.

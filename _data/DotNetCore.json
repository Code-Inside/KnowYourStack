It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

The program never sees the argument. `dotnet run` on the other hand, works just fine:\n\n    dotnet run prog.cs -- prog.cs\n\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nCreate a file called `demo.cs` with the following code to dump the arguments received by the program:\n\n```c#\nforeach (var (i, arg) in args.Index())\n    Console.WriteLine($\"args[{i}]: {arg}\");\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n    dotnet demo.cs -- demo.cs\n\nYou will see nothing printed, but then use `dotnet run`:\n\n    dotnet run demo.cs -- demo.cs\n\nand the output changes to:\n\n    args[0]: demo.cs\n\nIt appears that the file name being asked to run is swallowed if it appear _anywhere_ in the program arguments. Running:\n\n    dotnet demo.cs -- 1 2 3 demo.cs 4 5 6\n\nprints:\n\n    args[0]: 1\n    args[1]: 2\n    args[2]: 3\n    args[3]: 4\n    args[4]: 5\n    args[5]: 6\n\nAgain, `dotnet run` doesn't exhibit the same problem:\n\n    dotnet run demo.cs -- 1 2 3 demo.cs 4 5 6\n\nprints the correct and expected output:\n\n    args[0]: 1\n    args[1]: 2\n    args[2]: 3\n    args[3]: demo.cs\n    args[4]: 4\n    args[5]: 5\n    args[6]: 6\n\nWhat's more, `dotnet` without `run` seems to only swallow when argument supplied to the program is an exact match. In other words, the following work just fine:\n\n    dotnet .\\demo.cs -- 1 2 3 demo.cs 4 5 6\n    dotnet demo.cs -- 1 2 3 Demo.cs 4 5 6\n\n### Further technical details\n<details><summary>details of dotnet --info</summary>\n\n    .NET SDK:\n     Version:           10.0.101\n     Commit:            fad253f51b\n     Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.9f71effe\n     MSBuild version:   18.0.6+fad253f51\n    \n    Runtime Environment:\n     OS Name:     Windows\n     OS Version:  10.0.26200\n     OS Platform: Windows\n     RID:         win-x64\n     Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.101\\\n    \n    .NET workloads installed:\n     [wasm-tools]\n       Installation Source: VS 17.14.36811.4, VS 18.1.11312.151\n       Manifest Version:    10.0.101/10.0.100\n       Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100\\microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.current\\10.0.101\\WorkloadManifest.json\n       Install Type:              Msi\n    \n    Configured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\n    No workload sets are installed.

ASP.NET Core Static Web Assets in Razor Class Libraries.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using TypeScript with Static Web Assets in RCLs, rebuild operations fail because:\r\n\r\n1. **Timing issue**: TypeScript compilation runs during the Compile phase, AFTER Static Web Assets discovery has already occurred\r\n2. **Stale references**: During Clean, TypeScript targets delete the `.js` files, but `Content` items (added by Razor SDK globbing) persist in memory\r\n3. **Build failure**: `DefineStaticWebAssets` then fails because it finds `Content` items referencing files that no longer exist\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.TypeScript.targets` which:\r\n\r\n- **Hooks into `ResolveStaticWebAssetsInputsDependsOn`** to register TypeScript outputs AFTER compilation\r\n- **Removes TypeScript outputs from `Content`** before `CoreClean` and `ResolveProjectStaticWebAssets` to prevent stale item references\r\n- **Uses `DefineStaticWebAssets`/`DefineStaticWebAssetEndpoints`** for proper integration with compression, fingerprinting, and manifest generation\r\n- **Creates a manifest file**

`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.TypeScript.targets` | New targets file with TypeScript integration logic |\r\n| `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.targets` | Added conditional import when

However, TypeScript compilation runs during the `Compile` phase, **after** Static Web Assets discovery has already occurred.\n\nThis creates two problems:\n\n1. **Clean build**: TypeScript outputs are not discovered as static web assets because they don't exist yet when `ResolveProjectStaticWebAssets` runs. The files only appear to work during development due to a runtime fallback that serves files added after build-time discovery.\n\n2. **Rebuild**: The Razor SDK's default globbing automatically includes `wwwroot` files as `Content` items. During Clean, the TypeScript targets delete the `.js` files, but the `Content` items persist in memory. When Build runs, `DefineStaticWebAssets` fails because it finds `Content` items referencing files that no longer exist:\n\n```\nerror : The static web asset 'wwwroot\\MyScript.js' has source type 'Discovered' and is required \nto exist on disk at 'D:\\MyProject\\wwwroot\\MyScript.js', but the file does not exist.\n```\n\nThe TypeScript package does not coordinate with the Static Web Assets system to properly register its outputs or clean up `Content` item references when its outputs are deleted.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a new targets file `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.TypeScript.targets` that:\n\n1. Hooks into `ResolveStaticWebAssetsInputsDependsOn` to register TypeScript outputs as static web assets **after** compilation\n2. Removes TypeScript outputs from `Content` before `CoreClean` and `ResolveProjectStaticWebAssets` to prevent stale item references\n\nThe targets file should be conditionally imported when `EnableTypeScriptNuGetTarget='true'` (property set by the `Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild` NuGet package).\n\n### Affected Scenarios\n\n| Scenario | Status |\n|----------|--------|\n| Clean build | ⚠️ Assets not properly discovered (works only via dev fallback) |\n| Rebuild | ❌ Fails |\n| Incremental build after modifying .ts | ❌ May fail |\n| Clean followed by build | ❌ May fail |\n| Publish | ⚠️ Assets may be missing or incorrectly processed |\n\n### Related\n\nThis follows the same integration pattern as:\n- `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.JSModules.targets`\n- `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.ScopedCss.targets`","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52301","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Static Web Assets integration for Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild NuGet package\" (#52301)"},{"Id":"3773974659","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-01T01:05:59","Actor":"Atulin","Number":"52299","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hot reload crashes with `System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added.`","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\nI'm running my Aspire-based project with `dotnet watch`, edit a file, and suddenly I'm not running the project anymore.\n\nThe project consists of an Aspire host, and the main application using Razor Pages.

Please describe.\nIf you run `dotnet test` in MTP mode with an invalid argument, whilst you do get a clear error message at the top, you then get hundreds of lines (int he case of xunit over 700 lines) after it, which does a great job of hiding the error\n\nFor example, if you run `dotnet test --show-live-output true` for an xunit test app, you'll get the following output:\n```\nartifacts\\bin\\SharedAppHost\\debug\\SharedAppHost.dll (net10.0) Zero tests ran\nExit code: 5\n  Standard output: xUnit.net v3 Microsoft.Testing.Platform v2 Runner v3.2.1+a9cfb80929 (64-bit .NET 10.0.1)\n\n  Option '--show-live-output' has invalid arguments: Invalid value 'true' (must be one of: 'on', 'off')\n  Usage SharedAppHost.exe [option providers] [extension option providers]\n\n  Execute a .NET Test Application.\n\n  Options:\n      --config-file\n          Specifies a testconfig.json file.\n\n...<SNIP> - 700 more lines </SNIP>...\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWhilst the error message as a whole is clear, it is followed by hundreds of lines of noise, and it can take quite a lot of scrolling to find the original error.  And in a longer console session, you can easily scroll right past it).\n\nI can think of three ideas that would help make these errors easier to spot:\n\n1. Repeat the actual error at the very end of the `dotnet test --help` output so it shows as the last line(s) of output.\n2. When an error relates to a known argument (in this case `--show-live-output`), print just the help output for that argument - i.e. something like:\n    ```\n    Option '--show-live-output' has invalid arguments: Invalid value 'true' (must be one of: 'on', 'off')\n\n      --show-live-output\n          Determine whether to show test output (from ITestOutputHelper) live during test execution.\n              on  - turn on live reporting of test output\n              off - turn off live reporting of test output [default]\n    ```\n3. Don't print the output of `dotnet test --help` at all, and just print a singe line error along the lines of `Run \"dotnet test --help\" for more details on arguments\"\n\n### Additional context\nFor full context, the full output from `dotnet test --show-live-output true`.

The system cannot find the file specified.`\n\n### Project Details \n1. It is a multi-project based solution (API, Infra, Core, etc. )\n2. API project is the start-up project\n3. The solution is based upon dotnet 8\n4. We use GitHub actions with self hosted runner to build and deploy the project and later run it on lambda.\n\n### Necessary files and commands used\n\n- API project's .csproj \n\n```csproj\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n    <GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles>true</GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles>\n    <AWSProjectType>Lambda</AWSProjectType>\n    <CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>\n    <PublishReadyToRun>false</PublishReadyToRun>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer\" Version=\"9.0.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.Hosting\" Version=\"1.7.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"CsvHelper\" Version=\"33.1.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MediatR.Contracts\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"6.0.16\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning\" Version=\"5.1.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"5.1.5\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection\" Version=\"8.0.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"13.0.3\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Swashbuckle.AspNetCore\" Version=\"6.7.0\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\platform-jjz-service-core\\platform-jjz-service-core.csproj\" />\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\platform-jjz-service-domain\\platform-jjz-service-domain.csproj\" />\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\platform-jjz-service-Infrastructure\\platform-jjz-service-Infrastructure.csproj\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <Content Update=\"appsettings.json\">\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\n    </Content>\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n- dotnet CLI commands used in GitHub pipeline to publish project/artifact\n```bash\n  dotnet restore\n  dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained false -o ./publish\n```\n\n### Expected Behaviour\nWhen running the code via dotnet cli, the published artifact should run without any errors for every build created using same codebase on lambda (given that there are no other errors in codebase).\n\n\n\n### Actual Behaviour\nWhen lambda tries to run the published artifacts, some artifacts (that were generated via same codebase) always throw `ReflectionTypeLoadException` exception. Only after couple of attempts to re-publishing same code, this issue gets resolved on its own.\nI get the same error as the lambda error, if I try running the GitHub artifact on my local windows machine using `dotnet platform_jjz_service_api.dll`\n\nStack trace for runtime exception\n```csharp\nUnhandled exception.

This is a non-deterministic error, which randomly occurs (only some builds throw this runtime exception, other builds for same code work totally fine)\n2. When compared an erroneous artifact with a correct artifact, noticed that number of libraries in `platform_jjz_service_api.deps.json` is lesser in erroneous artifact.\n3. Changed the dotnet commands slightly to publish the release artifact, but no luck there : \n```\n  dotnet nuget locals all --clear\n  dotnet restore --locked-mode\n  dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained false -o ./publish\n```\n\n### Known Workarounds\nKeep re-deploying the same code mutiple times, eventually in one of the deployments, this issue goes away","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52294","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Non-Deterministic missing libraries in artifacts for same codebase (no changes)\" (#52294)"},{"Id":"3767131999","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-29T10:13:14","Actor":"Susie-1989","Number":"52293","RawContent":null,"Title":"The browser is stuck with error \"WebSocket connection to 'wss://localhost:65041/' failed:\" after dotnet watch for Blazor Web App ~ Server ~Global","State":"open","Body":"**REGRESSION INFO**: Repro on 9.0.308\n\n**INSTALL STEPS**\n\n1.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

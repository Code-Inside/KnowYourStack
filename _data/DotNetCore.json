These packages will be maintained by the .NET team and kept up to date as part of each servicing release for each of the supported .NET versions.\r\n\r\nThese are the package identifiers of the new set of packages to be added:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.Preview\r\n\r\n## Implementation Timeline\r\n\r\n1. Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428"},{"Id":"21598179327","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T16:38:05","Actor":"leecow","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/217","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)\" (#217) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Package Maintenance\r\n\r\n.NET Core was released in June 2016, and over the last six years, many thousands of NuGet packages have been published under the .NET umbrella. Many of these packages are legacy or out-of-support already. As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered. Please see the [.NET Package Deprecation list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/net-package-deprecation.md) and use issue https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7420 to comment."},{"Id":"21274785894","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T17:28:34","Actor":"mthalman","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/216","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Breaking Change: Revert the Console Formatter Default in .NET 6 Container Images\" (#216) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"In the .NET 6 `aspnet` container images we made the decision to default the console logger in `CreateDefaultBuilder()` to structured JSON logs in order to support container environments where folks use tools like fluentd or Azure Monitor to collect those logs.

That lead to elimination of some code that was actually\r\nneeded.\r\nIt also takes pointer aliasing rules more strictly in one place in jit.\r\nThat caused the optimizer to falsely assume that a callee with an argument\r\npassed by reference is not modifying that argument and used a stale\r\ncopy of the original value at the caller site.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes both of the issues. With this fix, runtime compiled\r\nusing clang 13 seems to be fully functional.\r\n\r\ncc @janvorli ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28232","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Fix build with Clang 13 (#63314)\" (#28232)"},{"Id":"1102399747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-10T18:26:24","Actor":"josalem","Number":"28231","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Enable System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSouce.AllowDuplicateSourceNames for partner","State":"closed","Body":"This change is easier to view if you toggle \"ignore whitespace changes\" on in the GitHub UI.\r\n\r\nThis change backports the opt-in, off-by-default flag, `System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSouce.AllowDuplicateSourceNames`.\r\n\r\nThis flag, if enabled, will bypass the check for whether an EventSource already exists with a given name or GUID. This is a release valve only intended for users who make heavy use of AssemblyLoadContext and are experiencing exceptions from this code path. It does not solve any of the issues that may arise from enabling this configuration.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThere is negligible risk involved with this change for most users. It is off-by-default and requires conscious action on the user's part to enable.\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, there _is_ a moderate amount of risk, as it is not a rigorously tested or previously supported scenario. Partner team validation and local testing of various scenarios showed that for specific use cases, it is sufficient.\r\n\r\nBelow is a collection of sample scenarios and the results of the traces when viewed in PerfView:\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with the _same_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: All events are received and correctly parsed\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with _different_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(int foo = 1) => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(string foo = \"foo\") => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: The last manifest received by PerfView is the one that gets used, so the `int` version of `MyEvent` gets parsed as the `string` version. I expected this kind of behavior.\r\n\r\n### Multiple self-describing `EventSource`s with the _same_ events\r\n```csharp\r\nEventSource a = new(\"a\");\r\nEventSource aa = new(\"a\");\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\na.Write(\"MyEvent\");\r\naa.Write(\"MyEvent\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: All events are received and parsed correctly.\r\n\r\n### Multiple self-describing `EventSource`s with _different_ events\r\n```csharp\r\nEventSource a = new(\"a\");\r\nEventSource aa = new(\"a\");\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\na.Write(\"MyEvent\", new { a = 1 });\r\naa.Write(\"MyEvent\", new { b = 2 });\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: All events are received and parsed correctly.\r\n\r\nI ran into issues building release/3.1 locally on macOS that seem unrelated to these changes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28231","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Enable System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSouce.AllowDuplicateSourceNames for partner\" (#28231)"},{"Id":"1082798764","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-13T19:34:17","Actor":"ayakael","Number":"28226","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backports Fix build on Alpine edge dotnet/runtime#45352","State":"closed","Body":"Made as part of Alpine Linux dotnet31 / dotnet5 packaging project, see dotnet/source-build#2695","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28226","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backports Fix build on Alpine edge dotnet/runtime#45352\" (#28226)"},{"Id":"1080101814","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-12T21:10:56","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"28225","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a\r\n- **Build**: 20211111.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: November 11, 2021 7:34:26 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 3df4410511ad9900804da00ec680bd1c7d6f21e1\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.x\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 1.0.0-beta.21552.6 to 1.0.0-beta.21561.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed**: [from 2.2.0-beta.21552.6 to 2.2.0-beta.21561.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging**: [from 1.0.0-beta.21552.6 to 1.0.0-beta.21561.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 2.0.0-beta.21552.6 to 2.0.0-beta.21561.2][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/afb7961...3df4410\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28225","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#28225)"},{"Id":"1098230388","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-10T18:24:27","Actor":"hoyosjs","Number":"28230","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix pools for crossdac","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28230","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix pools for crossdac\" (#28230)"},{"Id":"1092921022","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-04T00:43:57","Actor":"josalem","Number":"28229","RawContent":null,"Title":"Handle case where shutdown deadlocks on m_lock","State":"open","Body":"*Opening as draft for feedback and test coverage*\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/51579\r\n\r\n> Specifically, the order of events that cause this to occur is as follows with the chronological order of events in parenthesis:\r\n>\r\n>Thread 1: SetSessionWriteInProgress(1) -> WriteEvent (2) -> AllocateBufferForThread (5) [blocked on m_lock]\r\n>Thread 2: SuspendWriteEvent(3) -> SuspendWriteEvent(4) [blocked on YIELD_WHILE on SessionWriteInProgress]\r\n\r\nThis issue was fixed in 5.0 via c6d1756, however that is a 10k LOC change and not ideal for a servicing change.

Any providers declared in machine.config / app.config would be ignored (only the programmatic registration would apply). \r\n\r\nIs there a workaround while we migrate our application to .NET 5?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1790","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide DbProviderFactories as NuGet Package for .NET Standard 2.0\" (#1790)"},{"Id":"852541719","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-07T15:50:35","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"1788","RawContent":null,"Title":"Class ValueTask has different definitions between .Net Standard 2.1 and .Net 5","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Class-ValueTask-has-different-definition/1384249)._\n\n---\nClass ValueTask has different definitions between .Net Standard 2.1 and .Net 5: \nstatic property ValueTask.CompletedTask and static methods ValueTask.FromResult, ValueTask.FromCanceled and ValueTask.FromException are not available in .Net Standard 2.1.\n\nRegards,\nPaco.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 3/29/2021, 10:45 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

So redefining stream's sync object to lock over `this` achieves the same thing as the fix in 5.0 since operations over `Http2Stream` are guarded with stream's lock and operations with credit lock credit manager itself (separate sync object for window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReliability problem.\r\nReported by customer using YARP. They are hitting it for specific backend server (likely due to timing).

analysis: IDE0059 Unnecessary assignment of a vlue to 'variable'","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Incorrect-code-analysis:-IDE0059-Unneces/10041850)._\n\n---\n[severity:Other]\r\nVisual Studio is telling me that a variable assignment is unnecessary, and applying the suggested fix results in a compilation error. This C# code reproduces the issue:\n```cs\n    abstract class Foo\n    {\n        protected abstract void bar(out int v1, int v2);\n\n        public Foo()\n        {\n            int a = 2;\n            bar(out a, a);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThe suggested change is to remove ` = 2`. This results in a compilation error, because the variable `a` is not assigned prior to its use in the call to `bar`.\nInterestingly, if I mouse hover over the suggested fix to see a preview, there is a red squiggly line under the second a in the call to `bar` in the preview. The error is already seen by VS before the fix is applied to my code.\n\nCertainly the code could be cleaned up a bit, e.g. by consolidating those two lines as `bar(out int a, 2);`, and such a suggestion would be welcome. But suggesting a change that won't even compile isn't nice.\n\nA bit of a further complication in the code where I actually saw this: using `bar(out int a, 2);` doesn't always work. Here's an example:\n```cs\n    abstract class Foo\n    {\n        protected abstract void bar(out int v1, int v2);\n\n        public Foo()\n        {\n            int a = 2;\n        label1:\n            bar(out a, a);\n            if (a > 0) goto label1;   \n        }\n    }\n```\nObviously the use of goto is bad, and I've already re-structured the code in a way that avoids this issue, so this isn't an important issue at all in my case. But I thought I'd report this bug anyway.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/15/2022, 07:29 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/61347","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Incorrect code analysis: IDE0059 Unnecessary assignment of a vlue to 'variable'\" (#61347)"},{"Id":"1237594776","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-16T19:13:10","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"61346","RawContent":null,"Title":"Convert to interpolated string adds (object) to everything","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Convert-to-interpolated-string-adds-obj/10041793)._\n\n---\n[severity:It's more difficult to complete my work]\r\nSince the latest build/update choosing \"Convert to Interpolated String\" adds a cast to (object) to every part of the string.

Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking Change to .NET Packages on Winget\" (#218)"},{"Id":"1224334047","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T16:38:05","Actor":"leecow","Number":"217","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Package Maintenance\r\n\r\n.NET Core was released in June 2016, and over the last six years, many thousands of NuGet packages have been published under the .NET umbrella. Many of these packages are legacy or out-of-support already. As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered. Please see the [.NET Package Deprecation list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/net-package-deprecation.md) and use issue https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7420 to comment.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/217","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)\" (#217)"},{"Id":"1203587106","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T17:28:33","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"216","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking Change: Revert the Console Formatter Default in .NET 6 Container Images","State":"open","Body":"In the .NET 6 `aspnet` container images we made the decision to default the console logger in `CreateDefaultBuilder()` to structured JSON logs in order to support container environments where folks use tools like fluentd or Azure Monitor to collect those logs.

They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\n* If your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 2.1 incrementally. This means that users who reference the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` package must add a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\n* The shared framework for .NET Core 3.1 and later does not include `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.dll`. Users targeting netcoreapp3.1 or later must also update their `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package version.\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 3.1 and later completely. This means users who reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` can bump that version to 2.1.30. They don't need a new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` reference.\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core or .NET 5, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 9.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

This is commonly used by features like taggers or background analysis, that will listen to this event to restart analysis. Concretely, consider a case where the user switches branches and some closed files get reloaded. Those changes may change the types/members available, so we have to reanalyze those files.\n\nSince 1.0 this event was always raised on the UI thread. We've long regretted this, because this has increasingly became a bottleneck to performance. It's common for subscribers to do little to no work (or just queue other work on a timer), so jumping to the UI thread just to queue a timer is hugely wasteful, and with other performance work happening in Visual Studio this is starting to show up more in traces.\n\nWe didn't feel comfortable making a behavior breaking change by changing where we raise the event, so instead we're making this opt-in.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis\n{\n     public class Workspace\n     {\n+        public WorkspaceEventRegistration RegisterWorkspaceChangedHandler(Action<WorkspaceChangeEventArgs> handler, WorkspaceEventOptions? options = null);\n+        public WorkspaceEventRegistration RegisterWorkspaceFailedHandler(Action<WorkspaceDiagnosticEventArgs> handler, WorkspaceEventOptions? options = null);\n+        public WorkspaceEventRegistration RegisterDocumentOpenedHandler(Action<DocumentEventArgs> handler, WorkspaceEventOptions? options = null);\n+        public WorkspaceEventRegistration RegisterDocumentClosedHandler(Action<DocumentEventArgs> handler, WorkspaceEventOptions? options = null);\n+        public WorkspaceEventRegistration RegisterTextDocumentOpenedHandler(Action<TextDocumentEventArgs> handler, WorkspaceEventOptions? options = null);\n+        public WorkspaceEventRegistration RegisterTextDocumentClosedHandler(Action<TextDocumentEventArgs> handler, WorkspaceEventOptions? options = null);\n+        public WorkspaceEventRegistration RegisterDocumentActiveContextChangedHandler(Action<DocumentActiveContextChangedEventArgs> handler, WorkspaceEventOptions? options = null);\n     }\n\n     public record struct WorkspaceEventOptions(bool RequiresMainThread)\n     {\n         public static readonly WorkspaceEventOptions DefaultOptions = new(RequiresMainThread: false);\n         public static readonly WorkspaceEventOptions RequiresMainThreadOptions = new(RequiresMainThread: true);\n     }\n\n     public sealed class WorkspaceEventRegistration : IDisposable { }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n<!--\nPlease provide code examples that highlight how the proposed API additions are meant to be consumed.\nThis will help suggest whether the API has the right shape to be functional, performant and useable.\nYou can use code blocks like this:\n-->\n\n``` C#\n// some lines of code here\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n1. _Just call the existing event on a background thread._ This is a very breaking change, since lots of handlers in the wild will depend on the UI thread.\n2. _Create a new event like the old one, but continue to use .NET events._ This new pattern allows us to pass in an options during registration so we can add other flags without having to revise the entire API. It also allows for future growth, such as:\n   - We could offer overloads that take Func<Args, ValueTask>; we discussed doing this right away now but didn't think we needed it, but it's easy to add later.\n   - We can offer overloads that take new kinds of EventArgs. There's a number of problems with our current EventArgs that we've realized over the years and it'd allow a clean swap out to a new model.\n   - We can add options for batching, so we aren't dispatching lots of events only for each handler to do it's own batching.\n   - If we ever needed to make our WorkspaceChangedImmediate event public, we can do that just by adding another option.\n   - The WorkspaceEventRegistration type can offer a WaitUntilAllEventsRaised() so that way code that needs to subscribe to workspace changed and know when you've 'caught up' can do things more cleanly than is done today.\n\nFundamentally this approach lets us make a clean break from the past while setting us up for long term improvements.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe performance benefit here fundamentally requires extensions to move to the new API to get performance benefits. Internally we optimize our code so that if there are no legacy handlers (and no handlers using the MainThread option) we avoid a dispatch to the UI thread, but all it takes is one legacy handler to spoil things.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79007","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"New WorkspaceChanged APIs\" (#79007)"},{"Id":"3153951423","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-17T15:39:24","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"79006","RawContent":null,"Title":"The new c#14 extension member function does not show any references when being used.","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/The-new-c14-extension-member-function-d/10919273)._\n\n---\n[severity:It bothers me.

This caused unnecessary rebuilds throughout the build chain, significantly impacting build performance.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n**GenerateDepsFile.cs:**\n- Modified `WriteDepsFile()` method to generate content in memory first\n- Added XxHash64-based comparison with existing file content\n- Only writes the file when content actually differs\n- Preserves all existing validation logic\n\n**GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles.cs:**\n- Modified `WriteToJsonFile()` method to use the same incremental approach\n- Generates JSON content in memory before comparing with existing file\n- Uses XxHash64 for fast content comparison\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Uses `System.IO.Hashing.XxHash64` for efficient content comparison (package already referenced)\n- Generates output content in memory to compare against existing files\n- Maintains identical output format and all existing functionality\n- Handles edge cases: non-existent files, empty content, large files\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded comprehensive unit tests that verify:\n- Files are not rewritten when content is unchanged (timestamp preservation)\n- Files are properly updated when content changes\n- First-time file creation works correctly\n\n## Performance Impact\n\nThis change eliminates unnecessary file writes that were causing cascading rebuilds. Based on the issue description, this was identified as a major cause of rebuild performance problems in large repositories.\n\n## Example Behavior\n\n**Before:** Task always writes file, causing downstream rebuilds\n```\nGenerateDepsFile -> writes deps.json (even if identical) -> triggers dependent tasks\n```\n\n**After:** Task only writes when content changes\n```\nGenerateDepsFile -> compares content -> skips write if identical -> no unnecessary rebuilds\n```\n\nFixes #49349.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> -

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

The issue occurred because:\n1. Users explicitly pass arrays to disambiguate overloads (e.g., `M(string, params object[])` vs `M(string, string)`)\n2. The refactoring would change which overload is called and produce incorrect interpolated strings\n\n### Checklist\n- [x] Understand the current code flow and identify where the issue occurs\n- [x] Determine the best fix approach (block refactoring when explicit arrays detected)\n- [x] Implement the fix - added checks for array/collection expressions\n- [x] Add comprehensive tests\n- [x] Apply code formatting\n- [x] Request and pass code review\n- [x] Add WorkItem attributes to tests\n- [x] Final verification\n\n### Implementation Details\nThe fix enhances the existing check at lines 85-105 to detect three patterns:\n\n1. **Explicit array creation**: `new object[] {...}` \n   - Detected syntactically via `IsArrayCreationExpression()`\n   \n2. **Implicit array creation**: `new[] {...}`\n   - Detected via `ImplicitArrayCreationExpression` syntax kind check\n   \n3. **Collection expressions**: `[...]` (C# 12+)\n   - Detected via `GetTypeInfo().ConvertedType` check\n   - Collection expressions are target-typed and may not have a natural Type\n\nWhen any of these patterns are detected for the last argument of a params method, the refactoring returns null (not offered).\n\n### Test Coverage\nAdded 3 new comprehensive tests (all marked with WorkItem for #80788):\n- ‚úÖ `TestCollectionExpressionArgument_WithNamedParameter()` - Tests `M(\"{0}\", args: [\"a\"])`\n- ‚úÖ `TestCollectionExpressionArgument_WithNamedParameter2()` - Tests `M(\"{0} {1}\", args: [\"a\", \"b\"])`\n- ‚úÖ `TestImplicitArrayCreationArgument()` - Tests `M(\"{0}\", new[] { \"a\" })`\n\nExisting test covers explicit array creation: `TestFormatWithParams()` - Tests `String.Format(..., new object[] {...})`\n\n### Changes Summary\n- **Modified**: `AbstractConvertPlaceholderToInterpolatedStringRefactoringProvider.cs` \n  - 20 lines added, 2 deleted\n  - Enhanced array detection logic with comprehensive comments\n- **Added**: 3 new test cases in `ConvertPlaceholderToInterpolatedStringTests.cs`\n  - All tests marked with WorkItem attribute referencing issue #80788\n\n### Code Review\n‚úÖ Passed automated code review\n‚úÖ Addressed feedback to add WorkItem attributes\n\n### Impact\nThis fix ensures that:\n1. Users can safely use explicit arrays with params to control overload resolution\n2. The refactoring is only offered when it can be safely applied\n3.

In cultures like Swedish, the minus sign is formatted as `‚àí` (U+2212) instead of `-` (U+002D), and numbers might use different digit representations, leading to runtime FormatException.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `Binder_InterpolatedString.cs`, the code uses `stringBuilder.Append` with numeric values (line 384 for format positions, line 388 for alignment values) which uses the current culture's formatting rules.\n\n**Solution**: Modified the code to use `ToString(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)` for all numeric append operations to ensure values are always formatted with standard ASCII characters, regardless of the compilation culture.\n\n**Changes**:\n- C# Compiler (`Binder_InterpolatedString.cs`):\n  - Line 384: Fixed `nextFormatPosition++` (format position index) to use InvariantCulture\n  - Line 388: Fixed alignment value to use InvariantCulture\n- VB Compiler (`Binder_InterpolatedString.vb`): Already had InvariantCulture in place (verified)\n\n**Testing**: \n- C# Test (`CodeGenInterpolatedString.cs`):\n  - Converted test to use raw string literals\n  - Added `CultureContext` to explicitly test compilation under Swedish culture (sv-SE)\n  - Verifies the code compiles and runs correctly with both positive and negative alignment values\n  - Validates the emitted IL contains the correct format strings (e.g., `{0,-100}`) even when compiled under sv-SE culture\n- VB Test (`InterpolatedStringTests.vb`):\n  - Added parallel test to verify VB compiler behavior under Swedish culture\n  - Validates emitted IL contains correct format strings with negative alignment\n- All existing interpolated string tests continue to pass for both C# and VB\n\n**Plan**:\n- [x] Analyze the issue and locate the problematic code\n- [x] Fix line 388 to use invariant culture formatting for the alignment value\n- [x] Add a test that verifies the emitted IL contains correct format strings with negative alignment\n- [x] Build and test the changes\n- [x] Code review\n- [x] Address PR feedback: use raw string literals and add culture testing\n- [x] Apply InvariantCulture to all numeric StringBuilder.Append calls (line 384)\n- [x] Verify VB compiler and other files (VB already correct)\n- [x] Add similar test for VB compiler\n- [x] Verify no new test failures introduced\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n\n<issue_title>FormatException on right padding a interpolated string</issue_title>\n<issue_description>\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight padding a string with interpolated strings throw a System.FormatException\r\n\r\nCode to reproduce:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n\r\n    namespace tmp5\r\n    {\r\n        class Program\r\n        {\r\n            static void Main(string[] args)\r\n            {\r\n                var st = \"1\";\r\n                var st2 = $\"{st,100}\";  // Ok\r\n                var st3 = $\"{st,-100}\"; // FormatException here\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nBug reproduced with net5.0 and netcore3.0 build target.\r\n\r\ndotnet --info\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   5.0.100\r\n Commit:    5044b93829\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     ubuntu\r\n OS Version:  18.04\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         ubuntu.18.04-x64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/5.0.100/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 5.0.0\r\n  Commit:  cf258a14b7\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.404 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  5.0.100 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.10 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.0 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.10 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.0 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nOperating System: Feren OS 2020.07\r\nKDE Plasma Version: 5.19.4\r\nKDE Frameworks Version: 5.72.0\r\nQt Version: 5.14.2\r\nKernel Version: 5.4.0-56-generic\r\nOS Type: 64-bit\r\nProcessors: 16 √ó AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor\r\nMemory: 31,4 GiB of RAM\r\nGraphics Processor: AMD Radeon RX 5700\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nFound this when porting a project from .net framework 4.6.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nI have found no workarounds.</issue_description>\n\n<agent_instructions>Copilot, it looks like we're appending a value in a culture sensitive fashion, instead of in an invariant fashion.

Interlocked.Exchange with nullable types","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/InterlockedExchange:-compiler-choses-wr/1259784\n\nThis PR adds a regression test to verify that `Interlocked.Exchange` correctly handles nullable reference types without requiring explicit type parameters.\n\n## Background\n\nPreviously, the compiler would incorrectly report CS8625 (\"Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type\") when using `Interlocked.Exchange` with nullable custom types:\n\n```csharp\n#nullable enable\nusing System.Threading;\n\nclass2? c = new class2();\nvar c1 = Interlocked.Exchange(ref c, null); // Previously: CS8625 error\n```\n\nHowever, the same code worked fine with `object?`:\n\n```csharp\nobject? o = new object();\nvar o1 = Interlocked.Exchange(ref o, null); // Always worked correctly\n```\n\nThe issue has since been fixed (likely as part of improvements to null literal type inference for generic methods mentioned in #43536), but there was no test coverage to prevent regression.\n\n## Changes\n\nThis PR adds a comprehensive test `InterlockedExchangeWithNullableTypes` in `MethodTypeInferenceTests.cs` that:\n\n- Verifies `Interlocked.Exchange` works correctly with both `object?` and custom nullable types\n- Confirms the inferred types have the correct nullable annotations\n- Ensures no compilation errors occur\n- Uses raw string literals as per coding standards\n- Includes a WorkItem attribute linking to the original issue\n\nThe test validates that all three scenarios work correctly:\n1. `Interlocked.Exchange(ref object?, null)` \n2. `Interlocked.Exchange(ref class2?, null)` (the previously broken case)\n3. `Interlocked.Exchange<class2?>(ref class2?, null)` (explicit type parameter workaround)\n\nThis test will prevent any future regressions and can be used to close the original issue.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original

Special types (arrays, dynamic, strings)\n\nThe only case where we still report a compile-time error is when the collection expression has no type at all (e.g., bare `null` literal or `const object NULL = null`).\n\n## Behavior Change\n\n**Before:**\n- `foreach (var x in null)` ‚Üí Error (still an error)\n- `foreach (var x in (IEnumerable<int>)null)` ‚Üí Error (now allowed)\n- `foreach (var x in default(int[]))` ‚Üí Error (now allowed)\n- `foreach (var x in (int[])null)` ‚Üí Error (now allowed)\n\n**After:**\n- `foreach (var x in null)` ‚Üí Error (no type information)\n- `foreach (var x in (IEnumerable<int>)null)` ‚Üí Compiles, runtime error\n- `foreach (var x in default(int[]))` ‚Üí Compiles, runtime error\n- `foreach (var x in (int[])null)` ‚Üí Compiles, runtime error\n\nThis matches the general C# principle that type casts are validated at compile time based on types, not values.\n\nWith `#nullable enable`, these scenarios correctly produce nullable reference type warnings (CS8602: Dereference of a possibly null reference) without blocking compilation.\n\n## Testing\n\nComprehensive test coverage including:\n- Tests for `default(int[])`, `default(string)`, `default(IEnumerable<T>)`\n- Tests for `(int[])null`, `(string)null`, `(IEnumerable<T>)null`\n- Tests for `(dynamic)null` and `(int[,])null` (multidimensional arrays)\n- Tests for type parameter `(T)null` where `T : class, IEnumerable<int>`\n- Tests for untyped expressions: `default`, `new()`, `[]`\n- Test for plain `null` (still reports error as expected)\n- Nullable-enabled versions of all tests verifying appropriate warnings\n- All 123 ForEachTests pass\n\nFixes dotnet/roslyn#45616\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Undeserved error when foreach loop used on null enumerable</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>This program\r\n> \r\n> ```csharp\r\n> using System;\r\n> using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n> public class C\r\n> {\r\n>     static void Main()\r\n>     {\r\n>         foreach (var i in (IEnumerable<int>)null)\r\n>         {\r\n>             Console.Write(i);\r\n>         }\r\n>     }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> causes the compiler to produce\r\n> \r\n> `error CS0186: Use of null is not valid in this context`\r\n> \r\n> but that error is not justified by the language specification.\r\n> </issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>@copilot This does seem inappropriate.

Please describe.\n\nIt can be helpful as a app author to know if my app is running as a .NET Tool or not, but the SDK doesn't currently give me any signals that this is the case. I can technically see if my app's actual launching binary is `dotnet`, but that only works for local tools or tools run via `dnx` - global tools use apphost shims that don't surface `dotnet` at all.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nThe CLI should ensure that when tools are run, a marker environment variable is available in the spawned process . This environment variable should be called `DOTNET_TOOL_EXECUTION_MODE` and it should be set to one of the following values:\n\n* `oneshot` when the tool is run via `dnx`, `dotnet tool execute`, or `dotnet dnx` (which are actually all the same mechanism, just with different names for _reasons_)\n* `local` when the tool is run via `dotnet <toolname>` or `dotnet tool run <toolname>` as a local tool\n* `global` when the tool is run via `<toolname>` with it's globally-installed apphost shim, or `dotnet <toolname>` when the global shim is named `dotnet-<toolname>`\n\nThis will be easier for `oneshot` and `local` tools, because the CLI owns the spawning of those processes. For global tools, we'll likely have to find a way to embed the env var into the script-or-apphost that's launching the app, and I don't know if that capability exists out of the box with the apphosts that we currently use.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make it easy to detect if a .NET app is running as a .NET SDK Tool\" (#51336)"},{"Id":"3526603951","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-17T15:34:45","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"51333","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] Fix incorrect path handling in MSBuild SDK","State":"closed","Body":"Thanks for asking me to work on this.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program‚Äôs scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù or ‚Äúnot complete.‚Äù Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe‚Äôve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

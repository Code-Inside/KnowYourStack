This caused a race-condition on the read/write on this list, causing a crash. The problem does not exist in the 5.0 fix, only for the 3.1 backport. \r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMedium/High. When hit with this issue, a customer may experience a crash. A customer may run into this issue when they turn on the runtime counters (System.Runtime) or any other set of counter providers, and then modify the list of counters while a counter callback is happening by either creating or disposing instances of EventCounters. For customers that don't consume/create their own EventCounters, this shouldn't be a problem. For those who do, it's pretty easy to hit with the likelihood increasing the shorter they set the counter polling interval.\r\n\r\n## Regression \r\n\r\nYes. From 3.1.8 -> 3.1.9 servicing release. \r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n\r\nWe do not have a local repro of this failure, but we tested the fix by providing a custom build of the runtime with this fix to the  internal partner test that initially reported this problem. They ran it in production that hit this issue and reported that this addresses the issue.\r\n\r\n## Risk \r\n\r\nThe root cause/fix is well-understood and the fix was verified through partner testing - I would say it is relatively low."},{"Id":"14207523816","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-16T16:15:41","Actor":"wtgodbe","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28104","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix ilasm managed resource lookup on Linux.\" (#28104) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"ILAsm did not properly find managed resources if they were not in the\r\nworking directory of ILAsm itself.

The following scenario is now supported:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass DynamicClass1\r\n{\r\n    public string Field1;\r\n    public int Field2;\r\n    public float Field3;\r\n    public Random Field4 = new Random();\r\n\r\n    public static string StaticField1;\r\n    public static int StaticField2;\r\n    public static float StaticField3;\r\n\r\n    static DynamicClass1()\r\n    {\r\n        StaticField1 = \"statically nice!\";\r\n        StaticField2 = 10;\r\n        StaticField3 = 3.56f;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\npublic static void DoFields()\r\n{\r\n    DynamicClass1 class1 = new DynamicClass1();\r\n    class1.Field1 = \"nice\";\r\n    class1.Field2 = 23;\r\n    class1.Field3 = 2.5f;\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field1);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field2);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field3);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field4);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void DoStaticFields()\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(DynamicClass1.StaticField1);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(string.Empty);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(DynamicClass1.StaticField2);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(DynamicClass1.StaticField3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe interpreter will happily load instance and static fields on both dynamically loaded types and types compiled into the native executable, while ensuring that static constructors have been run in both cases.\r\n\r\n_Note: Thread statics on dynamically loaded types are currently unsupported_\r\n\r\ncc @jkotas @MichalStrehovsky "}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"14280149251","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-23T05:11:30","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/14654","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[master] Update dependencies from microsoft/vstest\" (#14654) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:d8a596af-c18d-4760-2df5-08d849c580d6)\r\n## From https://github.com/microsoft/vstest\r\n- **Subscription**: d8a596af-c18d-4760-2df5-08d849c580d6\r\n- **Build**: 20201123-01\r\n- **Date Produced**: 11/23/2020 2:28 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 7207f7e435e4c5c0a5cfd88ececddb4f62a47425\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk**: [from 16.9.0-preview-20201120-04 to 16.9.0-preview-20201123-01][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/compare/2f58ac7...7207f7e\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:d8a596af-c18d-4760-2df5-08d849c580d6)\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"14279337660","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-23T02:29:15","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/14654","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[master] Update dependencies from microsoft/vstest\" (#14654) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:d8a596af-c18d-4760-2df5-08d849c580d6)\r\n## From https://github.com/microsoft/vstest\r\n- **Subscription**: d8a596af-c18d-4760-2df5-08d849c580d6\r\n- **Build**: 20201123-01\r\n- **Date Produced**: 11/23/2020 2:28 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 7207f7e435e4c5c0a5cfd88ececddb4f62a47425\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk**: [from 16.9.0-preview-20201120-04 to 16.9.0-preview-20201123-01][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/compare/2f58ac7...7207f7e\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:d8a596af-c18d-4760-2df5-08d849c580d6)\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"14273749929","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-11-21T23:23:17","Actor":"bruno-garcia","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/14653","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Don't warn out of support when building libraries\" (#14653) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Warning applications that they are targeting a version of .NET that's out of support makes total sense.\r\nI hope the ecosystem continues to move forward and folks continue to adopt new versions as they come out.\r\n\r\nBut when building a library, I' want to target the lowest TFM I need to get the API I require.

a potential race in iterating counters","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\nThere was a mistake that was made in backporting https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40259 to https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28089 where `_counters` was used to iterate instead of the snapshotted value of `counters`. `_counters` is a list that needs to be lock-protected, but this access was happening outside of the lock, which is what the snapshot is for. This caused a race-condition on the read/write on this list, causing a crash. The problem does not exist in the 5.0 fix, only for the 3.1 backport. \r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMedium/High. When hit with this issue, a customer may experience a crash. A customer may run into this issue when they turn on the runtime counters (System.Runtime) or any other set of counter providers, and then modify the list of counters while a counter callback is happening by either creating or disposing instances of EventCounters. For customers that don't consume/create their own EventCounters, this shouldn't be a problem. For those who do, it's pretty easy to hit with the likelihood increasing the shorter they set the counter polling interval.\r\n\r\n## Regression \r\n\r\nYes. From 3.1.8 -> 3.1.9 servicing release. \r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n\r\nWe do not have a local repro of this failure, but we tested the fix by providing a custom build of the runtime with this fix to the  internal partner test that initially reported this problem. They ran it in production that hit this issue and reported that this addresses the issue.\r\n\r\n## Risk \r\n\r\nThe root cause/fix is well-understood and the fix was verified through partner testing - I would say it is relatively low.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28112","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix a potential race in iterating counters\" (#28112)"},{"Id":"709001291","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-16T16:15:41","Actor":"mlindstr","Number":"28104","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix ilasm managed resource lookup on Linux.","State":"closed","Body":"ILAsm did not properly find managed resources if they were not in the\r\nworking directory of ILAsm itself.

See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40259 for a more detailed description on how it can happen.\r\n\r\nThis was initially reported from the Application Insights SDK team where they defined an EventListener callback that invokes EventSource constructor.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\nThis code path was introduced between 2.2 to 3.0, but it is not a regression specific to 3.1.\r\n\r\n## Testing \r\nTested locally with a repro app: https://gist.github.com/sywhang/61277e9f40c17e05eaab85676e63e4fc\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nRelatively low.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

This happened accidentally as part of a performance fix in 3.x.  That fix tried to ensure a seekable stream and would copy the backing stream contents when doing so.

Create a project with NRT turned off\r\n2. Add an assembly level attribute like the following: [assembly: JsonArray(typeof(string))] \r\n3. In a different file turn on NRT with: #nullable enable and then off again with #nullable restore\r\n4. In a Source Generator get a ITypeSymbol to the string from the attribute\r\n5. Notice that ITypeSymbol.NullableAnnotation returns 'NotAnnotated' when it should be 'None'\r\n6. Remove the #nullable enable and #nullable restore from the other file\r\n7. Notice ITypeSymbol.NullableAnnotation now is 'None'\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n* ITypeSymbol.NullableAnnotation should return 'None' if NRT is off for that section of code\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n* ITypeSymbol.NullableAnnotation returns 'NotAnnotated'\r\n\r\nThe help on NullableAnnotation is kind of vague about what 'None' means:\r\n```\r\n        //\r\n        // Summary:\r\n        //     The expression has not been analyzed, or the syntax is not an expression (such\r\n        //     as a statement).\r\n        //\r\n        // Remarks:\r\n        //     There are a few different reasons the expression could have not been analyzed:\r\n        //     1) The symbol producing the expression comes from a method that has not been\r\n        //     annotated, such as invoking a C# 7.3 or earlier method, or a method in this compilation\r\n        //     that is in a disabled context. 2) Nullable is completely disabled in this compilation.\r\n        None = 0,\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf None cannot be used to determine that NRT is off or on, then Roslyn needs to provide a way to determine this.\r\n\r\nI run into this problem writing JsonSrcGen which is a Json Source Generator. \r\n* If I don't' annotate my code the user will get warnings.\r\n* If I annotate my generated Json code to make everything nullable and the user makes there property non nullable then my generated code will produce a warning about possible null assignment.\r\n* If I suppress this warning then the users property could end up being set to null which may be surprising to the user.\r\n* I can't assume non nullable because then I won't support null in the json ever.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would want to detect the the property type is non nullable and then throw an exception if the Json is null for that property. By making the property type non nullable the user is telling me that they don't expect null in the Json and therefore if there is this is an error (so an exception is the correct thing)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/49555","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"No reliable way to tell if a reference type is nullable from a source generator\" (#49555)"},{"Id":"748165126","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-22T04:12:05","Actor":"AdamSpeight2008","Number":"49554","RawContent":null,"Title":"Parser Cleanup","State":"open","Body":"This is an initial investigation of how some refactoring of the parser code, effects the perf.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/49554","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Parser Cleanup\" (#49554)"},{"Id":"748128103","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-22T00:04:08","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"49553","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge master to features/ioperation","State":"open","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from master into features/ioperation.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/master\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/features/ioperation\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

After spending some time, I figured that double-clicking on the item, which navigates to the file, or opening the file explicitly, magically expands the error information. That is how the first two items in the screenshot got expanded. Simply clicking on the item (without navigating to the file) doesn't expand it. Hovering over the item doesn't show any tooltip.\r\n\r\n3) Sometimes the Error List stops doing the expansion described above.

One shouldn't have to jump between Build Output and Error List windows to figure out what exactly compiler was trying to \"say\". One shouldn't have to click items in the Error List or open dozens of files to understand the nature of the errors. I should be able to simply scroll through Build Output or Error List and get complete picture. Should be able to copy/paste information elsewhere without having to jump through hoops. I might have hundreds of errors, all caused by the same issue and, unless I have complete information to quickly glance over, I have to spend more time than necessary to figure this out. Often, the source of the errors is in a different location. I might not even need to open any of the files with errors to figure this out and fix the problem. Just give me complete information and do it quickly without requiring me to do a bunch of unnecessary operations. \r\n\r\n \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/49545","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extremely annoying experience in VS with multiline errors reported by compiler\" (#49545)"},{"Id":"748089145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-21T16:15:17","Actor":"brcrista","Number":"49548","RawContent":null,"Title":"C# nullable references: missed null with tasks and type inference","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nI've started using nullable references and they're great!

libraries","State":"open","Body":"Warning applications that they are targeting a version of .NET that's out of support makes total sense.\r\nI hope the ecosystem continues to move forward and folks continue to adopt new versions as they come out.\r\n\r\nBut when building a library, I' want to target the lowest TFM I need to get the API I require. For an _ASP.NET Core 3_ integration, that relies on the runtime store, that's `netcoreapp3.0`. Getting a warning to upgrade to `netcoreapp3.1` here is the only reason for me to do it. I don't believe though that dropping support to paying customers that for whatever reason are on a unsupported version of .NET is in the best interest of the company behind the library. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n``` /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/5.0.100/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.EolTargetFrameworks.targets(28,5): warning NETSDK1138: The target framework 'netcoreapp3.0' is out of support and will not receive security updates in the future. Please refer to https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-support for more information about the support policy. [/Users/bruno/git/sentry-dotnet/src/Sentry.AspNetCore.Grpc/Sentry.AspNetCore.Grpc.csproj]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf for some reason the warning will stay, is there a reason to silence it? `<NoWarn` didn't seem to work.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/14653","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Don't warn out of support when building libraries\" (#14653)"},{"Id":"747480400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-21T16:34:51","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"14633","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn-analyzers","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:e7c40fb8-9651-4ba2-dbe8-08d81c92f408)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers\r\n- **Subscription**: e7c40fb8-9651-4ba2-dbe8-08d81c92f408\r\n- **Build**: 20201120.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: 11/21/2020 12:15 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 5a8a764edd148cb1555cf518453c2645d5cd469c\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

The metadata can be set on a `PackageReference` and it will flow to the referenced assemblies, but setting it for individual assemblies requires adding this metadata at the appropriate step in the build with a custom target. The above suggestions would simplify this. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Target Name=\"ConfigureTrimming\"\r\n        BeforeTargets=\"PrepareForILLink\">\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <ManagedAssemblyToLink Condition=\"'%(Filename)' == 'MyAssembly'\">\r\n      <IsTrimmable>true</IsTrimmable>\r\n    </ManagedAssemblyToLink>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\ncould be simplified to:\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <TrimmableAssembly Include=\"MyAssembly\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be important to clarify whether the ItemGroup refers to assemblies by name or by file path (it's more common for ItemGroups to represent files on disk).

This shouldn't happen, only *direct* FrameworkReference should be nominated.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Checkout https://github.com/nkolev92/ProjectWithTransitiveFrameworkReference.\r\n\r\n2. Enable project system logging with $env:CPS_DiagnosticRuntime=1\r\n\r\n3. Do not restore/build. Load the solution in Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n4. Observe that restore happens twice. Observe that *nomination* has happened twice. \r\n\r\n5. If you inspect the nomination data you will see that 1st nomination is something like: \r\n\r\n```\r\nBEGIN Nominate Restore for C:\\Users\\Roki2\\Documents\\Code\\ProjectWithTransitiveFrameworkReference\\ConsoleApp\\ConsoleApp.csproj\r\n    MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath:     C:\\Users\\Roki2\\Documents\\Code\\ProjectWithTransitiveFrameworkReference\\ConsoleApp\\obj\\\r\n    OriginalTargetFrameworks:         \r\n    Target Frameworks (1)\r\n        .NETCoreApp,Version=v5.0\r\n            Framework References\r\n                Microsoft.NETCore.App -- (PrivateAssets:All)\r\n            Package Downloads\r\n            Project References\r\n            Package References\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the 2nd one has:\r\n```md\r\nBEGIN Nominate Restore for C:\\Users\\Roki2\\Documents\\Code\\ProjectWithTransitiveFrameworkReference\\ConsoleApp\\ConsoleApp.csproj\r\n    MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath:     C:\\Users\\Roki2\\Documents\\Code\\ProjectWithTransitiveFrameworkReference\\ConsoleApp\\obj\\\r\n    OriginalTargetFrameworks:         \r\n    Target Frameworks (1)\r\n        .NETCoreApp,Version=v5.0\r\n            Framework References\r\n                Microsoft.AspNetCore.App -- (PrivateAssets:)\r\n                Microsoft.NETCore.App -- (PrivateAssets:All)\r\n            Package Downloads\r\n            Project References\r\n            Package References\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because the project has a package that transitively pulls in the AspNet FrameworkReference. \r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\nOnly one nomination, thus one restore has happened. \r\nThe restore should not impact the data being sent to NuGet.\r\n\r\nNote that commandline restores similar to the *first* restore. \r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\nAfter the initial restore, a 2nd nomination comes in with additional FrameworkReference data. This causes an extra restore.\r\n\r\n**User Impact**:\r\n\r\nPerformance, delays solution load. \r\nNote that this also makes commandline restore outputs *dirty*, so restore would be more expensive. \r\n\r\ncc @panopticoncentral @davkean @lifengl \r\n\r\nRan into while trying to test bulk file tests. \r\nI had also been observing some *weird* restore counts in NuGet's RPS tests, and I think this partially explains those.   \n\n---\n\n@davkean commented on [Thu Nov 19 2020](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/6759#issuecomment-730984849)\n\nWe call a target provided by NuGet; CollectFrameworkReferences.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

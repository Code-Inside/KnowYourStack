The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

Apply IDE0022.\r\n\r\n    ```cs\r\n    using System.Diagnostics;\r\n    \r\n    internal sealed class Example\r\n    {\r\n    public static int GetRandomNumber() =>\r\n    #if SOME_DIRECTIVE\r\n        if (Debugger.IsAttached)\r\n        {\r\n            Debugger.Break();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        return Random.Shared.Next();\r\n    #endif\r\n    \r\n        new Random().Next();\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Define the `SOME_DIRECTIVE` preprocessor directive.\r\n\r\n    ```cs\r\n    #define SOME_DIRECTIVE\r\n    \r\n    using System.Diagnostics;\r\n    \r\n    internal sealed class Example\r\n    {\r\n        public static int GetRandomNumber() =>\r\n    #if SOME_DIRECTIVE\r\n            if (Debugger.IsAttached)\r\n            {\r\n                Debugger.Break();\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            return Random.Shared.Next();\r\n    #endif\r\n    \r\n            new Random().Next();\r\n    }\r\n    ```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt shouldn't even suggest this as a fix since the `return` code is conditional via preprocessor directives.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nIt doesn't compile after the preprocessor directive is defined (or set).\n\n### Regression?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Known Workarounds\n\n_No response_\n\n### Configuration\n\n.NET 7.0\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2022\r\nVersion 17.8.0 Preview 1.0\r\nVisualStudio.17.Preview/17.8.0-pre.1.0+34004.107\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework\r\nVersion 4.8.09032\r\n\r\nInstalled Version: Enterprise\r\n\r\nArchitecture Diagrams and Analysis Tools   00476-80000-00000-AA395\r\nMicrosoft Architecture Diagrams and Analysis Tools\r\n\r\nVisual C++ 2022   00476-80000-00000-AA395\r\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 2022\r\n\r\nADL Tools Service Provider   1.0\r\nThis package contains services used by Data Lake tools\r\n\r\nASA Service Provider   1.0\r\n\r\nASP.NET and Web Tools   17.8.92.59062\r\nASP.NET and Web Tools\r\n\r\nAzure App Service Tools v3.0.0   17.8.92.59062\r\nAzure App Service Tools v3.0.0\r\n\r\nAzure Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio   2.6.5000.0\r\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio\r\n\r\nAzure Functions and Web Jobs Tools   17.8.92.59062\r\nAzure Functions and Web Jobs Tools\r\n\r\nAzure Stream Analytics Tools for Visual Studio   2.6.5000.0\r\nMicrosoft Azure Stream Analytics Tools for Visual Studio\r\n\r\nC# Tools   4.8.0-1.23377.4+692d17e98436dfde74109aefe78f3507ae6c5b36\r\nC# components used in the IDE.

to reflect the correct semantics","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #69176\r\n\r\nCurrent UX and semantics for severity combo boxes in each of the tabs in the EditorConfig UX, i.e. Analyzers, Naming Styles and Code Styles tabs, have Severity combo boxes with following strings: `Disabled`, `Suggestion`, `Warning` and `Error`. `Disabled` setting currently maps to \"silent\" severity value in editorconfig, which doesn't disable the analyzer, but converts it into a hidden analyzer for which code fixes are still offered, i.e. it is essentially a refactoring. This is indeed confusing for the users as the wordings don't match the actual semantics.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we make the following changes:\r\n- Analyzers and Naming Styles tab now have following values for Severity combo box: `Disabled`, `Refactoring Only`, `Suggestion`, `Warning` and `Error`. `Disabled` now correctly maps to \"none\" in editorconfig, which disables the rule. `Refactoring Only` maps to \"silent\".\r\n- Code Styles tab has the following values for Severity combo box: `Refactoring Only`, `Suggestion`, `Warning` and `Error`. `Disabled` severity is not supported for code style settings. Code styles can instead be disabled by setting the option `Value` that turns off the style, such as \"Yes/No\", \"Always/Never\", etc. Theoretically, we can support the `Disabled` severity, which translates to 'none' value in editorconfig. However, adding this support would require us to update all our IDE code style analyzers to turn themselves off when 'option.Notification.Severity is ReportDiagnostic.Suppress', which is doable, but seems a bit of an overkill. We can wait for more feedback to see if this work is required.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69778","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update the severity combo boxes in EditorConfig UX to reflect the correct semantics\" (#69778)"},{"Id":"1875288298","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T10:54:40","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"69776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Parse errors when conditional directives are combined with raw string literals","State":"open","Body":"```csharp\r\n#if false\r\n\r\nvar x = \"\"\"\r\n    # Hello raw string literals\r\n    \"\"\";\r\n    \r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see why that fails, but I'm wondering if this can be improved.

the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/release/dev17.8\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch. Generally the author whose change introduced the conflicts should pull down this PR, fix the conflicts locally, then push up a commit resolving the conflicts.\n\n### Resolve merge conflicts using your local repo\nSometimes merge conflicts may be present on GitHub but merging locally will work without conflicts. This is due to differences between the merge algorithm used in local git versus the one used by GitHub.\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout -t upstream/merges/release/dev17.8-to-main\ngit reset --hard upstream/main\ngit merge upstream/release/dev17.8\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/release/dev17.8-to-main --force\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69766","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merge release/dev17.8 to main\" (#69766)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"SDK-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1876653793","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-01T03:29:19","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"35086","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 20230831.18\r\n- **Date Produced**: September 1, 2023 3:15:58 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 21c81d317c543b74c0974297cfdf0abf0c95b6d2\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Please describe.\r\nI work on NuGet, and it's not uncommon for me to need to provide samples. The `dotnet` CLI is fantastic to help bootstrap a multi-project sample quickly, as I can give a bunch of `dotnet new classlib -n Proj1`, `dotnet add Proj1 reference Proj2` statements, that the customer can copy-paste and get 70% of the way there. But currently, I have to write long-winded instructions \"hand edit proj1.csproj, and change `<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>` to `<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net8.0</TargetFrameworks>`, not the singular `TargetFramework` needs to change to the plural `TargetFrameworks`, in addition to the value inside the XML element\".\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n`dotnet new classlib -n MyLib1 -f netstandard2.0,net8.0`\r\n\r\nSince I listed `netstanard2.0` first, it should use the `netstandard2.0` template, and then replace `<TargetFramework>` with the plural, and the value I provided as args.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI know that there are difficulties because the different frameworks have more differences than just the `TargetFramework` value. Newer TFMs have nullable, and implic usings. But perfect doesn't need to be the enemy of good, which is why I suggest using the first TFM's template, then a simple replacement of the TargetFramework(s) element. Especially since Windows doesn't have good CLI tools for line replacement, so a one liner `sed` statement might work for Mac and Linux customers, if I think that the customer is, or might be, using Windows, then I have to give long instructions. \r\n\r\nThis will really help create samples that customers can copy-paste with much less effort than listing multiple `csproj` file contents, or writing long text descriptions of the actions needed","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/35065","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet new should support multi-targeting\" (#35065)"},{"Id":"1875387492","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T12:00:52","Actor":"YuliiaKovalova","Number":"35063","RawContent":null,"Title":"[DO NOT MERGE] Validate install-scripts changes","State":"open","Body":"changes from https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/commit/1f780db47dcd7ee359b0f495b55439aa0b35c4fa commit","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35063","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[DO NOT MERGE] Validate install-scripts changes\" (#35063)"},{"Id":"1875047860","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T11:44:12","Actor":"tmds","Number":"35062","RawContent":null,"Title":"Containers: LogHttpResponseAsync: include request method, and don't format a message when trace logging is not enabled.","State":"closed","Body":"Minor improvements.\r\n\r\n@baronfel @vlada-shubina ptal.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35062","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Containers: LogHttpResponseAsync: include request method, and don't format a message when trace logging is not enabled.\" (#35062)"},{"Id":"1874702020","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-31T07:37:49","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"35056","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:03acf5d2-59bd-494b-c390-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn\r\n- **Subscription**: 03acf5d2-59bd-494b-c390-08d8e9750d9d\r\n- **Build**: 20230830.6\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 31, 2023 3:53:46 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 0a5289acaadde17d768b8f69dbc35aeec74cc4f8\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-09-01T03:30:19.489945Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":7662}

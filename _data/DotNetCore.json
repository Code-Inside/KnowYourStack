If no, what is the benefit of the new feature?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1748","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Is it legal to decompile .NET libraries?\" (#1748)"},{"Id":"595131445","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T13:46:58","Actor":"Nekuskus","Number":"1754","RawContent":null,"Title":"System.TypeInitializationException","State":"open","Body":"I keep getting `System.TypeInitializationException: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Can't find file or assembly 'System.Private.CoreLib, Version=4.0.0.0', Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e` exception after moving my app from .NET Core to .NET Framework 4.7.2.

\"csc.exe\" exited with code -2146232797 on a complex switch expression","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: Visual Studio 16.7.5\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**: Try compiling the following code snippet (I'm using the default .NET Core Console App in VS).\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to have something to do with the complexity of the `switch` expression and amount of cases and usage of the `.Any`, but I cannot figure it out. \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\n\r\nnamespace Sample\r\n{\r\n    internal class Row\r\n    {\r\n        public string Message { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    internal class Program\r\n    {\r\n        private static void Main()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(ProcessRow(new Row()));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static string ProcessRow(Row row)\r\n        {\r\n            if (row == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(row));\r\n            return row switch\r\n            {\r\n                { Message: \"stringA\" } => \"stringB\",\r\n                var r when new[] { \"stringC\", \"stringD\" }.Any(x => r.Message.Contains(x)) => \"stringE\",\r\n                { Message: \"stringF\" } => \"stringG\",\r\n                _ => \"stringH\",\r\n            };\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**: It either compiles (it looks valid to me) or gives me a reasonable error I can work with (if it's not actually valid code for some reason).\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**: It takes a while, and then finishes with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMSB6006\t\"csc.exe\" exited with code -2146232797.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI also tried it on [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/) and it was giving me this stack trace (not sure if it's actually related):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object.\r\n   at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.SmallDictionary`2.HandleInsert(AvlNode node,

This is what happens when I build and run the API, I receive the following as a webpage: \r\n```\r\nHTTP Error 500.31 - ANCM Failed to Find Native Dependencies\r\nCommon solutions to this issue:\r\nThe specified version of Microsoft.NetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.App was not found.\r\nSpecific error detected by ANCM:\r\nA JSON parsing exception occurred in [C:\\Users\\username\\source\\repos\\MainLibraries\\WebAPI\\WebAPI\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.1\\WebAPI.deps.json]: * Line 1, Column 2 Syntax error: Malformed token Error initializing the dependency resolver: An error occurred while parsing: C:\\Users\\username\\source\\repos\\MainLibraries\\WebAPI\\WebAPI\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.1\\WebAPI.deps.json\r\n```\r\nI've looked into the json files this mentions, however the json file is completely blank. \r\nThis is the full error log in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n```\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018: The \"GenerateDepsFile\" task failed unexpectedly.\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018: System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added.\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentException(ExceptionResource resource)\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.Insert(TKey key, TValue value, Boolean add)\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at System.Linq.Enumerable.ToDictionary[TSource,TKey,TElement](IEnumerable`1 source, Func`2 keySelector, Func`2 elementSelector, IEqualityComparer`1 comparer)\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel.DependencyContextWriter.WritePortableTarget(IReadOnlyList`1 runtimeLibraries, IReadOnlyList`1 compilationLibraries)\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel.DependencyContextWriter.WriteTargets(DependencyContext context)\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel.DependencyContextWriter.Write(DependencyContext context)\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel.DependencyContextWriter.Write(DependencyContext context, Stream stream)\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.GenerateDepsFile.WriteDepsFile(String depsFilePath)\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.GenerateDepsFile.ExecuteCore()\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.TaskBase.Execute()\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskExecutionHost.Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.ITaskExecutionHost.Execute()\r\n1>C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.402\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(194,5): error MSB4018:    at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskBuilder.<ExecuteInstantiatedTask>d__26.MoveNext()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThings I've tried:\r\n\r\nDeleting bin and obj (Worked first time I encountered this issue)\r\nRepairing VS (Worked second time I encountered this issue)\r\nReinstalling VS\r\nChanging target framework to 3.0 and 2.0 -

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

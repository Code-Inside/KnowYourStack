The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

You can include this schema within a NuGet package to help provide validation for users editing their appsettings. However if that schema is invalid, in any form it will break the inteilises and auto complete of the last two versions of visual studio. A simple way to break it is to add a comment in the json schema.\n\nThere is no errors, anywhere. Deleting bin, obj, .vs, visual studios internal cache still does not resolve the issue. I even looked in Structured Log Viewer to find any, not a single hint. This lead to me wasting wayyyy to much time trying to figure out why it was broken. \n\nI have attached a demo project which will recreate the issue. Just build the `Poisioned.Package` and then build the `Source Project`. You will need to close visual studio and reopen. At that point you will notice syntax highlting will be gone on all nuget packages, in this case Newtonsoft.Json\n\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=B0aba22830b1c48df9733d4be3298d586639035253218852230_20260108-221521-image.png&tid=0aba22830b1c48df9733d4be3298d586639035253218852230)\n\n**Effects:**\n* Visual Studio 2022\n* Visual Studio 2026\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 1/9/2026, 06:08 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

There you will also find some time measuring.\n\nBuilding without analyzers (`/p:RunAnalyzersDuringBuild=false`) reduced the build time to values similar to VS2022 (still slightly slower).\n\nDuring analysis of this issue, I found the [reportanalyzer switch](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/analyzers/Report%20Analyzer%20Format.md), and this one brought me to the root cause of the delay I think:\n\nHere are some log snippets (the first line translates to “Total analyzer execution time”):\n\nVS2022:\n```\nGesamtausführungszeit des Analysetools: 10,801 Sekunden.\n  Zeit (s)    %   Analysetool\n  6,212   57   System.Windows.Forms.Analyzers.CSharp, Version=9.0.12.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\n  6,194   57      System.Windows.Forms.CSharp.Analyzers.AvoidPassingTaskWithoutCancellationToken.AvoidPassingTaskWithoutCancellationTokenAnalyzer (WFO2001)\n  0,018   <1      System.Windows.Forms.CSharp.Analyzers.MissingPropertySerializationConfiguration.MissingPropertySerializationConfigurationAnalyzer (WFO1000)\n  2,546   23   Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.NetAnalyzers, Version=9.0.12.32904, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\n```\n\nVS2026:\n```\nGesamtausführungszeit des Analysetools: 64,305 Sekunden.\n  Zeit (s)    %   Analysetool\n  59,593   92   System.Windows.Forms.Analyzers.CSharp, Version=9.0.12.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\n  59,572   92      System.Windows.Forms.CSharp.Analyzers.AvoidPassingTaskWithoutCancellationToken.AvoidPassingTaskWithoutCancellationTokenAnalyzer (WFO2001)\n  0,021   <1      System.Windows.Forms.CSharp.Analyzers.MissingPropertySerializationConfiguration.MissingPropertySerializationConfigurationAnalyzer (WFO1000)\n  2,385    3   Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.NetAnalyzers, Version=9.0.12.32904, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\n\n```\n\nSo it seems \"System.Windows.Forms.CSharp.Analyzers.AvoidPassingTaskWithoutCancellationToken.AvoidPassingTaskWithoutCancellationTokenAnalyzer\" causes the delay.\n\nThe file \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\18\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\Roslyn\\csc.exe\" of VS2026 has file version 5.0.26.5402, the same file in VS2022 has 4.1400.25.41205\n\nAdding a \".editorconfig\" file with this line optimizes compile time:\n```\ndotnet_diagnostic.WFO2001.severity = none\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/82055","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Performance regression in VS2026 in AvoidPassingTaskWithoutCancellationTokenAnalyzer\" (#82055)"},{"Id":"3821062514","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-17T08:51:29","Actor":"jhinder","Number":"82037","RawContent":null,"Title":"\"Use coalesce expression\" drops trivia","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: VS 18.2.0\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\nInvoke \"Use coalesce expression\" on the `if` keyword.\n\n```csharp\nclass C\n{\n    public void M()\n    {\n#pragma warning disable\n        var value = M2();\n        // Test\n#pragma warning restore\n        if (value == null)\n        {\n            throw new InvalidOperationException();\n        }\n    }\n\n    string?

Added tests in `UseCoalesceExpressionForIfNullStatementCheckTests.cs`\n- `TestNotOfferedWithDirectivesOnIfStatement_LeadingPragma`: Validates no refactoring when `#pragma warning` directives are present\n- `TestNotOfferedWithDirectivesOnIfStatement_LeadingRegion`: Validates no refactoring when `#region` directives are present\n- `TestNotOfferedWithDirectivesOnIfStatement_TrailingDefine`: Validates no refactoring when `#if` directives are present\n- All tests annotated with `WorkItem` for issue #82037\n\n## Testing\n✅ All 29 tests in UseCoalesceExpressionForIfNullStatementCheckTests pass\n✅ Build succeeds with no errors\n✅ Simplified implementation verified to work correctly\n\n## Behavior\n**Before:** The code fix would remove the if-statement and lose all directives/comments in its trivia\n**After:** The code fix is not offered when the if-statement contains preprocessor directives, preserving them\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>\"Use coalesce expression\" drops trivia</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: VS 18.2.0\n> \n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\n> Invoke \"Use coalesce expression\" on the `if` keyword.\n> \n> ```csharp\n> class C\n> {\n>     public void M()\n>     {\n> #pragma warning disable\n>         var value = M2();\n>         // Test\n> #pragma warning restore\n>         if (value == null)\n>         {\n>             throw new InvalidOperationException();\n>         }\n>     }\n> \n>     string?

This leads to expected analysis not happening on their projects. The reason for this behavior is that we did not 'advance' the analysis levels as part of TFM bumping to 10 + preparing for stable releases around RC time.\r\n\r\nCustomers can workaround this by specifying an AnalysisLevel of `preview`.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR: \r\n* bumps the hard-coded analysislevel constants to `10` for latest and `11` for preview - the expected values for the .NET 10 release\r\n* creates the '.NET 10' release snapshot data for the analyzers so the tests that verify the behavior of the `latest` analysislevel start working again \r\n* re-enables and adds new tests that will fail when the new TFM is bumped each major version, so that we address this automatically each release\r\n\r\n## Was this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n- [x] Hard to classify - it's a regression in _user expectations_ but the 10.x features are available to use (via analysislevel `preview`) \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded/re-enabled tests that demonstrate correct use of the 10 analysislevel rulesets for projects that use `latest`, and use of the 11 rulsesets for projects that use `preview`.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low** - the tests cover this logic quite well, and this procedure is one we've done several times in the past.\r\n\r\nWe'll want to backport for 1xx as well.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52511","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/10.0.1xx] Bump analysislevel constants for .NET 10 release\" (#52511)"},{"Id":"3822492197","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T15:20:29","Actor":"jjonescz","Number":"52509","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add csc.rsp test","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52509","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add csc.rsp test\" (#52509)"},{"Id":"3821207290","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T11:41:56","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"52505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0.3xx] Handle assemblies gracefully","State":"closed","Body":"Backport of #52308 to release/10.0.3xx\n\n/cc @Youssef1313 @mariam-abdulla","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52505","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/10.0.3xx] Handle assemblies gracefully\" (#52505)"},{"Id":"3821680293","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T11:40:42","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"52508","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0.2xx] Handle assemblies gracefully","State":"open","Body":"Backport of #52308 to release/10.0.2xx\n\n/cc @Youssef1313 @mariam-abdulla","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52508","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/10.0.2xx] Handle assemblies gracefully\" (#52508)"},{"Id":"3821380747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-16T10:23:51","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"52507","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] Fix CssScope metadata change detection feedback","State":"closed","Body":"Thanks for the feedback on #52282.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

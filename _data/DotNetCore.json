The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

So you will be creating a CodeRefactoringProvider. \n> 2. This will work for C# and VB.  But we're just going to start by making C# work. \n> 3. You'll need to create an `AbstractAddImportCodeRefactoringProvider` in `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Features`.  This can sit next to AbstractAddImportCodeFixProvider.cs\n> 4. The refactoring will work in the following fashion.  The refactoring will start with the location the user is at, and will see if it is on some name that binds to a namespace, and has a type name accessed off of it.  Note that this may be as simple as `System.Console` or as complex as `global::System.Console` or `System.Collections.Generic.List<int>` etc.  Because this is in the shared 'Features' layer, you should use `ISyntaxFactsService` to do the analysis here so that it will work for VB/C#.\n> 5. If you find such a namespace name, then you will offer the user a code action to `Add import and simplify type name`.\n> 6. When this code action runs, it will do 3 things:\n> \n> 1. It will add the `using` to the proper scope (namespace or compilation unit).  You can use `IAddImportsService` to help with this.\n> 2. It will then both add the `Simplifier.Annotation` annotation to the namespace (or possibly namespace+type) name that it was invoked off of.  This way the code action infrastructure will attempt to remove that superfluous name after the `using` is added.\n> 3. It will go through the file looking for types or expressions that start with some name, and will check if that name is a type-name in the new namespace it's about to add a `using` for.  These type names may now bind differently, or become ambiguous.  So the refactoring should attempt to bind the current name, and replace it with `SyntaxGenerator.TypeExpression(typeSymbol, true/false)` so that the name is now qualified appropriately.  If the name is ambiguous, this will stay.  But if it is not ambiguous, the code action infrastructure will remove that qualification that you added.  \n> \n> 1. You will then need to make a C# specific subclass of your abstract code refactoring provider.  There should be almost nothing in this.  It will exist just to properly export the `[ExportCodeRefactoringProvider(...)]` with a proper name and language binding.\n> \n> Finally, add a lot of tests for this.  Add a new `AddUsingCodeRefactoringTests.cs` that sits next to `AddUsingTests.cs`.

We rely on a committed `packages.lock.json` file. We need mechanisms to handle two distinct update scenarios efficiently:\n\n- **Scenario A (Internal Packages):** Update the _resolved_ version of an internal floating package _without_ changing the `.csproj` file.\n- **Scenario B (3rd-Party Packages):** Update the _pinned_ version of an external package in the `.csproj` file and the corresponding lock file entry, _without_ affecting the pinned versions of other internal packages.\n\n### Problem\n\nThe current tools only offer an \"all or nothing\" approach (`dotnet restore` for nothing, `dotnet restore --force-evaluate` for everything). It is impossible to achieve Scenario B reliably: changing the `.csproj` intent and running a restore immediately causes a full re-evaluation of the internal dependencies, potentially pulling unintended newer versions into the lock file.\n\nOur current manual workarounds are complex, error-prone, and involve converting all dependencies to pinned versions in the `.csproj` files to gain manual control, a process that fundamentally alters our intended dependency management strategy.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nWe would like command-line arguments that enable selective updates while preserving the locked state of all other packages.\n\nA potential syntax could look like this:\n\n```bash\n# Update a single package to latest compatible version, keeping all others locked\ndotnet restore --update-package <PackageName> [--version 1.2.3]\n\n# Perform a restore that respects the .csproj changes for ONE package only, keeping others locked\ndotnet restore --selective-update <PackageName> \n```\n\nThese commands would provide the necessary granularity to manage updates safely and efficiently.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51940","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Granular control for package updates in `RestoreLockedMode` (selective updates)\" (#51940)"},{"Id":"3670713140","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-27T10:06:13","Actor":"Grastveit","Number":"51939","RawContent":null,"Title":"Option in CPM to use 'newest available' floating version resolution (highestMinor or highestPatch) instead of oldest available","State":"open","Body":"We are requesting a configuration option within Central Package Management (CPM) to change the default behavior of floating version resolution from _oldest available_ to _newest available_ (highest patch or highest minor version).\n### Scenario\nWe use floating versions for our internal NuGet packages (e.g., `Version=\"1.0.*\"`). This approach is by design, allowing developers to automatically pick up the latest updates in a standard build flow.\nWe recently attempted to migrate our version management to Central Package Management (`Directory.Packages.props`) to DRY our configurations.\n### Problem\nWe discovered that when using CPM, the `dotnet restore --force-evaluate` command resolves to the oldest available version that matches the float pattern, whereas specifying versions directly in `.csproj` files resolves to the newest available version.\nThis difference in behavior prevents us from migrating to CPM, as we rely on the _newest available_ version resolution to ensure developers are always building against the most current internal package updates.\n### Desired Behavior\nWe would like a configuration property (e.g., in `Directory.Packages.props`) that allows users to explicitly opt-in to the newest available resolution strategy when using floating versions within CPM.\nExample properties could be `<CentralPackageFloatingVersionResolution>Newest</CentralPackageFloatingVersionResolution>` or a similar mechanism that aligns the CPM behavior with the behavior previously found in non-CPM projects.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51939","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Option in CPM to use 'newest available' floating version resolution (highestMinor or highestPatch) instead of oldest available\" (#51939)"},{"Id":"3670659553","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-27T09:50:23","Actor":"GauteAtSemine","Number":"51938","RawContent":null,"Title":"Option to explicitly ignore `packages.lock.json` file when present on disk","State":"open","Body":"We are requesting a documented feature or MSBuild property that allows users to explicitly ignore an existing `packages.lock.json` file during the NuGet restore process.\n\n### Scenario\n\nWe operate projects in two distinct modes:\n\n1. **\"Package Mode\":** The default, where a committed `packages.lock.json` file is used to lock internal, floating-version package references, ensuring deterministic historical builds.\n2. **\"Project Mode\":** A specific `Condition` (detected by solution name) where we switch from `PackageReference` to `ProjectReference` for internal dependencies (e.g., in a monolith or Aspire application). In this mode, the lock file should be entirely ignored, as direct project references supersede it.\n\n### Problem\n\nIn previous tooling versions, simply not defining `RestorePackagesWithLockFile` allowed us to ignore the on-disk lock file seamlessly. In recent .NET SDK and NuGet versions, the presence of a `packages.lock.json` file automatically triggers validation and modification (adding `\"type\": \"Project\"` entries) during the solution restore phase in Visual Studio and the CLI. This breaks our mode-switching capability and pollutes the repository with unwanted file changes.\n\n### Desired Behavior\n\nWe require a reliable mechanism (an MSBuild property like `<NuGetIgnoreLockFile>true</NuGetIgnoreLockFile>`) to disable the lock file feature entirely for a specific restore operation, even if the `packages.lock.json` file exists on disk.\n\nThis would allow us to restore the previous seamless behavior using existing MSBuild property conditions (`Directory.Build.props`), avoiding complex file-renaming hacks or wrapper scripts that fall outside of standard Microsoft tooling and IDE integration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51938","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Option to explicitly ignore `packages.lock.json` file when present on disk\" (#51938)"},{"Id":"3666026832","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-27T06:24:46","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"51924","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/8.0.3xx' => 'release/8.0.4xx'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/8.0.3xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/8.0.4xx.

See Exceptions for the error message. \nThe \"bug\" being that this message is very vague and doesn't point toward the actual cause of the problem. My assumption is that this error is thrown because the Sql package doesn't relate to `NETCoreAppMaximumVersion` (but I'm not sure). \nWhen I commented out the `UnsupportedTargetFrameworkVersion` attribute in the `Microsoft.NET.SupportedTargetFrameworks.props` file. It gave me an error that made much more sense and made it very easy to understand what actually was the problem and I could update the sql SDK:\n\n> C:\\Users\\User\\\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.build.sql\\1.0.0-rc1\\Sdk\\Sdk.targets(60,3): error MSB4019: The imported project \"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100\\Sdks\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack\\build\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets\" was not found.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.3  Runtime or .NET 9.0.103 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

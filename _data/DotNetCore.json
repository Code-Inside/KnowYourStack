name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 and .NET 8.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n* If you're using .NET 10.0, you should download and install .NET 10.0.0-rc.2.25476.107 Runtime or .NET 10.0.100-rc.2.25476.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/10.0.\n* If you're using [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core) nuget package, update to the latest version 2.3.6 using either of the following methods:\n\n    * Using the NuGet Package Manager UI in Visual Studio:\n            - Open your project in Visual Studio.\n            - Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select \"Manage NuGet Packages...\" or navigate to \"Project > Manage NuGet Packages\".\n            - In the NuGet Package Manager window, select the \"Updates\" tab.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

The issue is with **timing of when synthesized top-level types are emitted during the compilation process**.\n\n### Nature of the Failures\n\nThe failures show: `System.InvalidOperationException : body != null` in `ReferenceIndexer.ProcessMethodBody()`. This occurs when:\n1. Synthesized top-level types (inline arrays and ReadOnlyList types) are enumerated during metadata indexing\n2. Their methods are visited, but method bodies haven't been generated yet\n3. The assertion `Debug.Assert(body != null)` fails\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe previous code had synthesized types nested under `PrivateImplementationDetails`, which was only returned after being \"frozen\" (i.e., after method compilation). My changes moved these types to be truly top-level, but didn't initially implement the same freezing mechanism.\n\n### Changes Made\n\n**Commit 1**: Moved tracking from PrivateImplementationDetails to PEModuleBuilder  \n**Commit 2**: Fixed thread-safety in GetOrAdd pattern  \n**Commit 3** (current): Added freeze mechanism:\n- Added `_frozenSynthesizedTopLevelTypes` field to track frozen state\n- `GetAdditionalTopLevelTypeDefinitions()` now returns empty until types are frozen\n- `FreezeSynthesizedTopLevelTypes()` is called after compiling additional type methods\n- This ensures types are only emitted AFTER their method bodies exist\n\n### Current Status\n\nTests are still failing (238 failures, down from 415 initially). The freeze mechanism is in place, but there's still an issue with method body generation timing. The methods are being compiled via `CompileSynthesizedMethods()`, but when visited during metadata indexing, bodies appear to be null.\n\nThis suggests there may be an additional issue with how/when method bodies are stored or retrieved for these synthesized types, or potentially an issue with the compilation flow that needs investigation.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Decouple tracking of synthesized top-level types from `PrivateImplementationDetails` class</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>The fact that the private implementation detail type is responsible for tracking types that aren't nested into it is very confusing. \r\n> This also creates an unnecessary coupling between otherwise unrelated things, forcing us to create the PrivateImplementationDetails type in the output when we might not need it.

Generate state machine with simplified `MoveNextAsync` marked as runtime-async\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\nWe recently implemented the runtime-async feature, which uses a more straightforward lowering of async methods instead of using compiler-generated state machines. The doc is here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/compilers/CSharp/Runtime%20Async%20Design.md\n\nThe next step for this feature is to lower async-iterator methods (ie. those with async and a compatible return type like `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`) in a more straightforward way.\nThis should be done conditionally on the runtime-async feature being turned on.\nHere are some design notes on such lowering: \nhttps://gist.githubusercontent.com/jcouv/aa5359db1b15522013cf19ef52dcc18f/raw/a647031482ac539028c52bf12f9bc7a675523dd7/async2-iterator.md\n\nHere's a copy of the notes:\n\nI've been thinking about how to implement async-iterators on top of runtime-async.  \nAn async-iterator is currently implemented as a core `MoveNext()` method (containing the user code) with `MoveNextAsync()` and `DiposeAsync()` entry points that call it.  \nWith runtime-async, we can simplify this down to a `MoveNextAsync()` method (containing the user code) with a secondary `DisposeAsync()` entry point (essentially does `disposeMode = true; await MoveNextAsync();`).  \n\n\n## Lowering of await\n\n`await` is left as an `await2` (ie. no longer introduces states into the compiler-generated state machine):\n```csharp\n// an await in user code becomes:\nawait2 ... // ie. compiler just uses special calling convention, but leaves this up to runtime to handle\n```\n\n## Lowering of yield return\n\n`yield return` is lowered as a suspension of the state machine (essentially `__current = ...; return true;` with a way of resuming execution after the `return`):\n```csharp\n// a `yield return 42;` in user code becomes:\n__state = stateForThisYieldReturn;\n__current = 42;\nreturn true; // in an ValueTask<bool>-returning async2 method, we need only return a boolean\n\nlabelForThisYieldReturn:\n__state = RunningState;\nif (__disposeMode) /* jump to enclosing finally or exit */\n```\n\n## Lowering of yield break\n\n`yield break` is lowered as continuing execution in disposal mode:\n```csharp\n// a `yield break;` in user code becomes:\ndisposeMode = true;\n/* jump to enclosing finally or exit */\n```\n\nNote: this design uses a single method for both normal and disposal execution (like async-iterators currently do), but it would also be closer to fit this into the existing iterator rewriter design (normal execution is MoveNext and disposal is Dispose, shared code is extracted to helper methods).\n\nBelow are two examples to illustrate the building blocks in context:\n\n## Example without try/finally (trivial disposal)\n```csharp\nclass ScenarioWithoutTryFinally\n{\n    // Original C# code\n    public static async IAsyncEnumerable<int> M()\n    {\n        Console.Write(1);\n        await Task.Delay(1);\n        Console.Write(2);\n        yield return 42;\n        Console.Write(3);\n    }\n\n    // Generated IAsyncEnumerable implementation\n    // Note: each yield return gets assigned a state (< -3)\n    private class Unspeakable : IAsyncEnumerable<int>, IAsyncEnumerator<int>, IAsyncDisposable\n    {\n        public int __state;\n        int __current;\n        int __initialThreadId;\n        bool __disposeMode;\n        //CancellationTokenSource __combinedTokens; // UNDONE\n\n        const int NotStartedStateMachine = -3;\n        const int FinishedState = -2;\n        const int RunningState = 0;\n\n        public Unspeakable(int state)\n        {\n            __state = state;\n            __initialThreadId = Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId;\n        }\n\n        IAsyncEnumerator<int> IAsyncEnumerable<int>.GetAsyncEnumerator(CancellationToken token)\n        {\n            Unspeakable result;\n            if (__state == FinishedState && __initialThreadId == Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId)\n            {\n                __state = NotStartedStateMachine;\n                __disposeMode = false;\n                result = this;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                result = new Unspeakable(NotStartedStateMachine);\n            }\n            return result;\n        }\n\n        int IAsyncEnumerator<int>.Current => __current;\n\n        private const int stateForYieldReturn42 = -4;\n\n        public async2 ValueTask<bool> MoveNextAsync() // This is \"async2\" so the generated code need only return a boolean\n        {\n            // dispatch block\n            #region dispatch block\n            switch (__state)\n            {\n                case stateForYieldReturn42:\n                    goto labelYieldReturn42;\n            }\n            #endregion\n\n            // entry\n            if (__disposeMode) goto setResultFalseLabel;\n            __state = RunningState;\n\n            // start of user code\n            Console.Write(1);\n\n            // await\n            __current = default;

i < 10; i++)\n        {\n            JsonSerializerOptions options = new()\n            {\n                PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,\n                ReadCommentHandling = JsonCommentHandling.Skip\n            };\n\n            var output = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<int[]>(\"[1,2,3]\", options);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFor version 1, I'm honestly not sure what should happen - maybe nothing, as the fix appears to make the code worse, not better.\nFor version 2, I could see the fixer creating a static variable to hold the options for use in each construction.\nFor version 3, I would hope the fixer would, at the very least, move the instance creation outside the loop, as duplicating it inside the loop doesn't improve the performance at all.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nAfter using the provided fixer, the following was produced:\n\nVersion 1 - Top-level program\n```cs\nJsonSerializerOptions jsonSerializerOptions = new()\n{\n    PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,\n    ReadCommentHandling = JsonCommentHandling.Skip\n};\nJsonSerializerOptions options = jsonSerializerOptions;\n\nvar output = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<int[]>(\"[1,2,3]\", options);\n```\n\nVersion 2 - In a class constructor:\n```cs\n    public Test()\n    {\n        JsonSerializerOptions jsonSerializerOptions = new()\n        {\n            PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,\n            ReadCommentHandling = JsonCommentHandling.Skip\n        };\n        JsonSerializerOptions options = jsonSerializerOptions;\n\n        var output = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<int[]>(\"[1,2,3]\", options);\n```\n\nVersion 3 - In a loop inside a standard method:\n```cs\n    public void M()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n        {\n            JsonSerializerOptions jsonSerializerOptions = new()\n            {\n                PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,\n                ReadCommentHandling = JsonCommentHandling.Skip\n            };\n            JsonSerializerOptions options = jsonSerializerOptions;\n\n            var output = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<int[]>(\"[1,2,3]\", options);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nVersion 3 does also have an extra option, although after the one above, which alters the method to allow a `JsonSerializerOptions` instance to be passed in as a parameter, which is much better.\n\n### Regression?\n\nThe problem seems to also be in NET8, but not in NET7.\n\n### Known Workarounds\n\nIgnore or suppress the rule.\n\n### Configuration\n\nUsing VS 17.13.0 Preview 4 in a NET9 console application, running on Windows 11 x64.\n\n### Other information\n\n_No response_</issue_description>\n\n<agent_instructions>Please check whether there are any unit tests for CA1869 in top-level statements. We do not want this analyzer to run in top-level statements. If it's issuing warnings, please fix it to not. Either way, ensure there's a test in place for this.</agent_instructions>\n\n## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n\n<comments>\n<comment_new><author>@eiriktsarpalis</author><body>\n> After using the provided fixer\n\nI'm pretty sure the analyzer in question doesn't come with a fixer.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program‚Äôs scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù or ‚Äúnot complete.‚Äù Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe‚Äôve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

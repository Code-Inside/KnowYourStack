name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Only the single-caret case was supported\n2. Multi-caret scenarios resulted in incorrect caret positions  \n3. Primary caret could end up in the wrong location\n4. Additional unwanted carets were sometimes added\n\n**Solution:**\n- Track new caret positions using ITrackingPoint as each split is processed (in reverse order)\n- Tracking points automatically adjust positions as subsequent edits are applied\n- After all edits are complete, get the final position of each tracking point\n- Use `SetMultiSelection` extension method to set all carets at once\n\n## Changes Made\n\n**Modified `SplitStringLiteralCommandHandler.cs`:**\n- Use `PooledObjects.ArrayBuilder` for tracking point collection\n- Renamed `pooledSpans` to `finalCaretSpans` for clarity\n- After all splits complete, resolve tracking points to final positions\n- Use `textView.SetMultiSelection()` to set all carets at once (with the last as the primary)\n\n**Simplified test `TestMultiCaretPositionsAreAllSet`:**\n- Now uses `TestHandled` helper method with markup\n- Leverages existing test infrastructure for validation\n- More concise and maintainable\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe key challenge was handling position changes across multiple buffer edits:\n- Spans are processed in reverse order (last to first) to avoid position invalidation of earlier positions\n- Each split produces a new snapshot and a new caret position\n- Using raw int positions would be incorrect because earlier edits shift later positions\n- ITrackingPoint automatically adjusts positions as the buffer changes\n- Final positions are resolved from tracking points in the final snapshot\n\n## Security Summary\n\n‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL scanner\n‚úÖ All code review feedback addressed\n‚úÖ All changes are minimal and focused on the specific issue\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>String splitter incorrectly handles multi-caret scenarios</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>Hitting enter in the following cases results in odd behavior:\r\n> 1)\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41759/196561257-d5810734-5d23-4951-b795-041bbc240e51.png)\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41759/196561260-a5c798b8-309e-46f3-a4f8-94f04af904ef.png)\r\n> \r\n> The primary caret is moved to the first location and additional 2 carets are added.

It looks like our logic for determining the new text is correct.  However, we mess up where teh *caret* is supposed to go.  We currently have logic that bails out from setting the caret in the case where we have multiple initial carets in SplitStringLiteralCommandHandler.\n> \n> What probably makes sense is to build up the final locations of the carets as we make each edit (or compute it all after we make all the edits).  Then use some api to set all the carets at the end.  \n> \n> See IMultiSelectionBroker which could be helpful here.  Note: this may be complex since we compute from end to start, and earlier edits could affect the positions of later carets.

These keywords are referenced by the `PackageRegistration.pkgdef` file and used by Visual Studio's settings search functionality.\n\nFor example, C# included:\n- \"Enable full solution analysis\"\n- \"Perform editor feature analysis in external process\"\n\nBut VB did not have these keywords, even though both languages have the exact same analysis-related options in their Advanced settings pages.\n\n## Changes\n\nUpdated `/src/VisualStudio/VisualBasic/Impl/VSPackage.resx` resource ID `10160` to include all missing keywords, bringing it to parity with C#:\n- Analysis keywords: \"Enable full solution analysis\", \"Perform editor feature analysis in external process\"\n- Diagnostics: \"Show diagnostics for closed files\"\n- Navigation: \"Enable navigation to decompiled sources\", \"Always use default symbol servers for navigation\"\n- Import/Using directives\n- Highlighting, Outlining, Fading, Block Structure Guides\n- Editor Help, Extract Method, Implement Interface\n- Property generation options\n- And other missing search terms\n\nAll 13 localization .xlf files were automatically updated using `dotnet msbuild /t:UpdateXlf` (they are marked as \"needs-review-translation\" for the localization team).\n\n## Impact\n\nVisual Basic Advanced options will now be discoverable in Visual Studio's settings search using the same keywords that work for C#. This ensures feature parity between the two languages in the IDE.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Settings search filter does not show all hits</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Settings-search-filter-does-not-show-all/10318462)._\n> \n> ---\n> When I write analysis in the search filter, I get hits for C#, but not VisualBasic.\n> \n> The word \"analysis\" hits on Environment ‚Üí Preview Features and C# ‚Üí Advanced\n> \n> ![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=Bb0cf01ccda6d492ab93107544fc206e7638151147112100368_20230322-214510-image.png&tid=b0cf01ccda6d492ab93107544fc206e7638151147112100368)\n> \n> But not in Visual Basic ‚Üí Advanced\n> \n> ![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=Baeb24a99c25a4f0599244f0156b6eaba638151147419079320_20230322-214541-image.png&tid=aeb24a99c25a4f0599244f0156b6eaba638151147419079320)\n> \n> ---\n> ### Original Comments\n> \n> #### Feedback Bot on 3/22/2023, 09:33 PM: \n> \n> (private comment, text removed)\n> \n> ---\n> ### Original Solutions\n> (no solutions)</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Copilot, can you determine what needs to be done for VB to be found in these searches like it works with C#.

Language version: default (14.0).\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n```\r\nerror CS8304: Compiler version: '5.3.0-dev (a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0)'. Language version: default (14.0). Compiler path: '/path/to/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.dll'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Key Implementation Details\r\n\r\n1. Added `GetAssemblyLocation(Type type)` method in `CommonCompiler.cs` that retrieves the assembly location and returns `<unknown>` for edge cases like single-file deployments where `Assembly.Location` may be empty\r\n\r\n2. Modified `GetProductVersion(Type type)` method in `CommonCompiler.cs` to use the full commit SHA directly from `CommitHashAttribute` instead of truncating to 8 characters\r\n\r\n3. Removed short SHA logic: Eliminated `ExtractShortCommitHash()`, `GetShortCommitHash()`, `GetFullCommitHash()`, and `GetProductVersionWithFullHash()` methods to simplify the codebase and ensure consistent use of full commit SHA everywhere\r\n\r\n4. Updated `DirectiveParser.cs` to call `GetProductVersion` and `GetAssemblyLocation`, passing both the full SHA and assembly path to the error diagnostic\r\n\r\n5. Modified the error message format in `CSharpResources.resx` to include a third placeholder for the compiler path\r\n\r\n6. Updated tests in `PreprocessorTests.cs` to validate the new output format with full SHA\r\n\r\n7. Removed the `ExtractShortCommitHash` test that's no longer applicable\r\n\r\n### Code Simplification\r\n\r\nThis change results in a net reduction of 43 lines of code while improving consistency:\r\n- Single source of truth: `GetProductVersion()` now handles all version string generation\r\n- Eliminated code duplication and redundant methods\r\n- Full commit SHA used consistently in all outputs (both `#error version` and `/version`)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAll existing tests pass, including:\r\n- 7 `TestErrorWithVersion` tests across different language versions\r\n- 236 preprocessor directive tests\r\n- 145 version-related command line tests\r\n- Manual verification with multiple language versions (default, 9.0, preview)\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis change only affects the diagnostic message text for `#error version` and version display output. It does not modify any APIs or change compiler behavior beyond the error message format and version string display. The change maintains backward compatibility while providing more detailed version information.\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\r\n\r\n> Create a PR that expands the output of `#error version` from the C# compiler to log the path of the current compiler assembly\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\r\n---\r\n\r\nüí° You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

However, the actual behavior depends on the `SymbolDisplayParameterOptions` flags being set.\n\nUsers were confused when `NameAndSignature` didn't show parameter names or details, not realizing they needed to also specify appropriate `SymbolDisplayParameterOptions` flags to control what appears within the signature.\n\n## Changes\n\nUpdated the documentation for both `NameAndParameters` and `NameAndSignature` to:\n\n1. **Clarify the separation of concerns:**\n   - `SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle` controls **whether** the signature part appears\n   - `SymbolDisplayParameterOptions` controls **what** appears in the signature (types, names, modifiers, etc.)\n\n2. **Add explicit references:**\n   - Changed vague wording like \"will be determined by the other flags passed\" to explicitly reference `<see cref=\"SymbolDisplayParameterOptions\"/>`\n\n3. **Fix misleading examples:**\n   - Changed examples from `\"void SomeDelegate(int x)\"` to `\"void SomeDelegate(int, int)\"` to avoid implying parameter names are automatically included\n   - Parameter names only appear when `SymbolDisplayParameterOptions.IncludeName` is set\n\n## Example\n\n```csharp\nvar format1 = new SymbolDisplayFormat(\n    delegateStyle: SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature,\n    parameterOptions: SymbolDisplayParameterOptions.IncludeType);\n// Output: \"void SomeDelegate(int, bool)\" - types only, no parameter names\n\nvar format2 = new SymbolDisplayFormat(\n    delegateStyle: SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature,\n    parameterOptions: SymbolDisplayParameterOptions.IncludeType | SymbolDisplayParameterOptions.IncludeName);\n// Output: \"void SomeDelegate(int a, bool b)\" - types AND names\n```\n\nThe updated documentation makes it clear that users need to set the appropriate `SymbolDisplayParameterOptions` flags to get the desired level of detail in the signature.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>INamedType.ToDisplayString omits delegate's parameters</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: 4.3.0\r\n> \r\n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n> \r\n> SymbolDisplayFormat options:\r\n> ```C#\r\n> var format = new SymbolDisplayFormat(\r\n>         globalNamespaceStyle: SymbolDisplayGlobalNamespaceStyle.Omitted,\r\n>         typeQualificationStyle: SymbolDisplayTypeQualificationStyle.NameAndContainingTypesAndNamespaces,\r\n>         delegateStyle: SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature,\r\n>         miscellaneousOptions: SymbolDisplayMiscellaneousOptions.UseSpecialTypes);\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Code example:\r\n> ```C#\r\n> namespace A\r\n> {\r\n>     public delegate bool SyntaxReceiverCreator(int a, bool b);\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> **Expected Behavior**:\r\n> as `delegateStyle: SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature` is active, I expect `INamedType.ToDisplayString(format)` produces output:\r\n> ```\r\n> bool SyntaxReceiverCreator(int a, bool b)\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> **Actual Behavior**:\r\n> `INamedType.ToDisplayString(format)` produces output (without parameters):\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> bool A.SyntaxReceiverCreator()\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> From parameter description:\r\n> > **SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature** - Shows the name and the signature of the delegate (e.g. \"void SomeDelegate(int x)\").\r\n> \r\n> Issue in arcade: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11232</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Copilot, can you clarify teh docs for NameAndSignature.

Users expected that using `NameAndSignature` would automatically include parameter names and types based on the example in the documentation (\"void SomeDelegate(int x)\"), but were getting empty parameter lists instead.\n\n## The Issue\n\nGiven this code:\n```csharp\nvar format = new SymbolDisplayFormat(\n    globalNamespaceStyle: SymbolDisplayGlobalNamespaceStyle.Omitted,\n    typeQualificationStyle: SymbolDisplayTypeQualificationStyle.NameAndContainingTypesAndNamespaces,\n    delegateStyle: SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature,\n    miscellaneousOptions: SymbolDisplayMiscellaneousOptions.UseSpecialTypes);\n\n// For: public delegate bool SyntaxReceiverCreator(int a, bool b);\n```\n\nUsers expected: `bool SyntaxReceiverCreator(int a, bool b)`  \nBut got: `bool A.SyntaxReceiverCreator()` (empty parameter list)\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `NameAndSignature` option only controls **whether** the signature (return type + parameter list) is shown, not **what** is shown inside the parameter list. The actual content of the parameter list is controlled by the `SymbolDisplayParameterOptions` flags.\n\n## Changes Made\n\nUpdated the XML documentation for both enum values to explicitly clarify:\n\n1. **`NameAndParameters`**: Added documentation stating that this option determines whether the parameter list (the `(...)` part) is shown, and that the content is controlled by `SymbolDisplayParameterOptions`.\n\n2. **`NameAndSignature`**: Added documentation stating that this option determines whether the full signature (return type and parameter list) is shown, and that the content is controlled by `SymbolDisplayParameterOptions`.\n\nBoth now include explicit `<see cref=\"SymbolDisplayParameterOptions\"/>` references to guide users to the correct API for controlling parameter display content.\n\n## Example\n\nTo get the expected output with parameter details, users need to combine both options:\n\n```csharp\nvar format = new SymbolDisplayFormat(\n    delegateStyle: SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature,\n    parameterOptions: SymbolDisplayParameterOptions.IncludeType | \n                     SymbolDisplayParameterOptions.IncludeName,\n    // ... other options\n);\n```\n\nThis will produce: `bool SyntaxReceiverCreator(int a, bool b)` ‚úì\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>INamedType.ToDisplayString omits delegate's parameters</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: 4.3.0\r\n> \r\n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n> \r\n> SymbolDisplayFormat options:\r\n> ```C#\r\n> var format = new SymbolDisplayFormat(\r\n>         globalNamespaceStyle: SymbolDisplayGlobalNamespaceStyle.Omitted,\r\n>         typeQualificationStyle: SymbolDisplayTypeQualificationStyle.NameAndContainingTypesAndNamespaces,\r\n>         delegateStyle: SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature,\r\n>         miscellaneousOptions: SymbolDisplayMiscellaneousOptions.UseSpecialTypes);\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Code example:\r\n> ```C#\r\n> namespace A\r\n> {\r\n>     public delegate bool SyntaxReceiverCreator(int a, bool b);\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> **Expected Behavior**:\r\n> as `delegateStyle: SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature` is active, I expect `INamedType.ToDisplayString(format)` produces output:\r\n> ```\r\n> bool SyntaxReceiverCreator(int a, bool b)\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> **Actual Behavior**:\r\n> `INamedType.ToDisplayString(format)` produces output (without parameters):\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> bool A.SyntaxReceiverCreator()\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> From parameter description:\r\n> > **SymbolDisplayDelegateStyle.NameAndSignature** - Shows the name and the signature of the delegate (e.g. \"void SomeDelegate(int x)\").\r\n> \r\n> Issue in arcade: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11232</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Copilot, can you clarify teh docs for NameAndSignature.

Local finctions are statements, so `CS1031: Type expected` is reported during parsing. However, at the binding stage error `CS1004: Duplicate '{0}' modifier` is reported as well, so we have 2 diagnostics on the same token:\r\n> ```cs\r\n> class C\r\n> {\r\n>     void M()\r\n>     {\r\n>         static static void M() {}\r\n>     }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> [Sharplab link](https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgtghglgdgNAFxANwKYCcoDMCecAmIA1AD4ACATAAQDCAsAFADejVbVZALFQLIAUASlbsWDduI4BGAGxTZXXoKpMAvsLZqGKoA)\r\n> \r\n> Over all, there are several flaws with the current design, described above:\r\n> 1. No errors about duplicate declaration modifiers after parsing even though parser has all required information to report such errors\r\n> 2. Not intuitive `CS1031: Type expected` error for statements with duplicate modifiers even when the statement type is specified\r\n> 3. If there are several duplicate modifiers in a row, for declarations only 1 error is reported on the first duplicate modifier. For statements, there are several errors reported on every duplicate modifier\r\n> 4. Errors are produced during parsing for statements, but during binding for declarations\r\n> 5. 2 errors instead of 1 are reported for local finctions. Ideally, it should only be `CS1004: Duplicate '{0}' modifier` (see https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/32106)</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Copilot, see if you can make it so that duplicate modifier parsing is not reported in the parser at all, but is always handled somewhere during binding.  Note: try not to make hugely invasive changes.  Ideally, we can remove a small amount of code in the parser, move it into the binder, and only update the binder in a small number of places to check that.  \n> \n> Existing tests that validate end-to-end diagnostics should be unchanged.  But we may need to update parsing-only tests to demonstrate the new behavior.   If no parsing-only tests are affected, we should add new tests to show that these errors are not reported during parsing.</agent_instructions>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> <comment_new><author>@CyrusNajmabadi</author><body>\n> My preference is that all modifier errors get reported in a unified helper in binding.

In fact if CA2016 fired for the shown pattern, it would be doing the wrong thing (or at least it wouldn't be doing as well as it should).  The idiom being used is simply trying to time out an await, and using a Task.Delay combined with a Task.WhenAny to do it, but then not disposing of the resources created for that timeout, namely the timer underneath the Task.Delay.  So a dedicated CancellationTokenSource needs to be created that can be used to cancel the Task.Delay after the operation completes.\r\n> \r\n> I think the right answer here is shipping some form of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/27723, and then the analyzer would flag patterns like `await Task.WhenAny(task, Task.Delay(timeout))` and recommend switching to that new API.\r\n> cc: @eiriktsarpalis </body></comment_new>\n> <comment_new><author>@stephentoub</author><body>\n> There are lots of variations to the erroneous pattern, so it might be hard to flag them all as well as come up with a good fixer.

I'll make my case for why `dotup` or `dotnetup` might be a better name.\n\nThere are two tools (at least) that follow a similar pattern:\n\n- `rustup`\n- `swiftup`\n\nThose names are pretty good because they are two syllable and have great product-first alignment. Format: $\"{product}up\". That works great when the product name is one syllable. Not for the future: pick one syllable product names!\n\nThe analog of that for our ecosystem would be one of:\n\n- `dotnetup`\n- `dotup`\n\nI assert that both of these are strictly better than `dnup`.\n\n`dotnetup` is the obvious choice is we intend to also expose this functionality via the `dotnet` CLI. In that case, we'd expose `dotnet up`. Same thing, same name, but integrated or not, with no conflict in names. One comes with the CLI and the other is for the bootstrapping problem. The only downside of this is that it isn't a nice two syllable name like `rustup`.\n\n`dotup` is the middle-ground choice. It's has more brand focused name than `dnup` and is two syllables like `rustup` and unlike `dnup`. For better or worse, it wouldn't match `dotnet up` if we ever expose that.\n\nI see two benefits for `dnup`:\n\n- As short as one can image\n- Some alignment with `dnx`\n\nI find both of these uncompelling. `dnup` is not very descriptive as a name. People are going to be asking ChatGPT forever what this is. The alginment with `dnx` is a bit weak since `dnx` is entirely an acronym, like `dnvm`. We used to have `dnu`, which is effectively the acronym for `dotnetup`. I see no product need to make a tool with such a short name, particularly when our main tool is much longer and that develops will us 100x more.\n\nLast, a major use case for this tool is CI scripts. From a supply chain perspective, short names fail. Literally _anyone_ should be able to look at a CI script and immediately be able to guess the purpose of a tool. `rustup` passes this test. `dnup` does not. In fact, I've suggest that headless / unattended use of this tool is the most critical scenario, not interactive use. We're always very quick to think of interactive use as the primary scenario, but it often isn't.\n\nRelated: https://matklad.github.io/2025/03/21/use-long-options-in-scripts.html\n\nI pronounce `dnup` as d-n-up. It could equally be pronounced as \"down-up\". I also heard that some people say \"d-nup\". At the point that people start developing these alternative pronunciations I think we've lost the plot on the reason for the name. No one is reasonably going to call `rustup` as \"rustu-p\" or some other denigrated version. That's actually why `dnx` is better. It's all acronym. A short-form plus a real word inhererently eads to these challenges.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51448","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider a more brand-focused name than `dnup`\" (#51448)"},{"Id":"3551020542","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-24T21:11:24","Actor":"nagilson","Number":"51447","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add automation for merging dnup to release/dnup","State":"open","Body":"I think this is a good idea since we need to ship out of release/dnup.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate.

These changes expand the program‚Äôs scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù or ‚Äúnot complete.‚Äù Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe‚Äôve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.

Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Specifically, we recently moved to generating SG files in our OOP process, which we then marshal back to the VS process as the \"source of truth\" for generated files.\r\n\r\nThis operates by having VS ask OOP for the list of generated files (specifically their SourceText checksums).  These checksums are compared to what we have stored locally.  If they are different/new, then we go collect the source value from teh OOP server and we transmit to the client.  Then, on the client we construct a matching SourceText that has this content.\r\n\r\nWe've discovered this doesn't work.  Specifically, even if you know the 'text' and 'checksum algorithm' of a SourceText, you cannot necessarily reconstruct hte original checksum for a SourceText.  The reason for this is subtle, but is due to SourceTexts being able to be constructed with streams.  The SourceText is passed a stream, and it generates the checksum based on that stream.  It tehn *decodes* the stream to get the contents of hte file.  This decoding is lossy (think BOMs).  As such, the only way to get the same checksum again, is to have hte original stream (which is of course not held onto).\r\n\r\nTo address this we would like to be able to construct a SourceText *publicly* with a provided checksum.  That way we can construct a truly equivalent SourceText on hte VS side that truly matches the one on the OOP side.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\npublic class SourceText\r\n{\r\n    public static SourceText From(string text, Encoding? encoding = null, SourceHashAlgorithm checksumAlgorithm = SourceHashAlgorithm.Sha1);\r\n+    public static SourceText From(string text, Encoding? encoding = null, SourceHashAlgorithm checksumAlgorithm = SourceHashAlgorithm.Sha1, ImmutableArray<byte> checksum);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nAnother alternative the IDE team has been considering is not using this checksum at all (since it has additional issues on top of hte above) and instead moving to something like a new `Text Content Checksum`.  This checksum would be based just on the char-based text of hte SourceText instead.  As an example, it could use xxhash128 to produce a high-quality hash, at very high speeds, that would be independent of original bytes on disk.\r\n\r\nNote: the IDE could technically provide this on our side.  However, we'd need to use a CWT to map from SourceTexts to these checksums.  That's often going to be a very large number of elements in a CWT (roslyn has around 100k) which is definitely not ideal.  Putting the new checksum on the ST itself will def be cleaner.\r\n\r\n## Other examples\r\n\r\nhttps://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1388754 is another case where this arises.  Specifically, if checksum computation is deferred past the SourceText creation point (which happens for any SourceText not backed by bytes on disk), then it works by encoding the char contents back to bytes and then computing from those bytes.  But that char[]->byte[] conversion is lossy, and different char[]s can end up with the same byte[]s.  This leads to IDE scenarios where the textual content of a SourceText changes, but we think nothing has changed since we get the same `Checksum` back.  Adding a `Text Content Checksum` would resolve this as well, making sure that any change to the text contents would always give a new checksum.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70752","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Need a SourceText.From overload that allows passing a precomputed checksum.\" (#70752)"},{"Id":"1986449608","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-09T21:43:47","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"70751","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nullable compound assignment experiment","State":"open","Body":"For personal review only","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70751","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Nullable compound assignment experiment\" (#70751)"},{"Id":"1986387112","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-09T21:11:05","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"70746","RawContent":null,"Title":"`SymbolDisplayVisitor` doesn't correctly classify function pointer calling conventions","State":"closed","Body":"There are four calling conventions that are special-cased and hard coded in the compiler implementation.

A fix would be nice]\n### [Overview]\nWhen you automatically convert an `if` statement to a conditional expression in VisualStudio's C# editor, code that behaves differently from the code that is converted may be generated.\n\n### [Execution environment]\n\n- OS: Windows 10 64bit\n- Visual Studio: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.7.6\n- .NET Runtime: 6.0.24 and 7.0.13\n\n### [Sample code]\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;\n\nnamespace Experiment01\n{\n    internal class Program\n    {\n        [SuppressMessage(\"Style\", \"IDE0060:Remove unused parameter\", Justification = \"<Pending>\")]\n        private static int Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(Subtract(int.MaxValue, int.MinValue));\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        private static int Subtract(int x, int y)\n        {\n            if (x < 0) // If you select \"Quick actions and refactoring...\" and then \"Convert to conditional expression\" in this \"if\" statement, an unintended conversion will occur.\n                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(x));\n            checked // A similar problem occurs with \"unchecked\" or \"unsafe\" blocks.\n            {\n                return x - y;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### [Method of operation]\n1. Select \"Quick actions and refactoring...\" in the `if` part of `if (x < 0)` on line 17.\n2. Also select “Convert to conditional expression”.\n\n### [Expected results]\nThe corresponding \"if\" statement cannot be converted to a conditional expression.\n\n### [Actual results]\nThe `Subtract` method has been converted as follows.\n\n```csharp\n        private static int Subtract(int x, int y)\n        {\n            return x < 0 ? throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(x)) : x - y;\n            checked // A similar problem occurs with \"unchecked\" or \"unsafe\" blocks.\n            {\n            }\n        }\n```\n\n### Reproducibility\nThis problem will definitely reappear.\n\n### [Problem]\nThe code (`x - y`) that should originally be executed inside the `checked` block is now executed outside the `checked` block.\nNote that similar problems seem to occur not only with `checked` blocks, but also with `unchecked` or `unsafe` blocks.\n\n### [Additional Resources]\n\n#### `.editorconfig` file of the sample program solution\n\n```ini\nroot =

interpolated strings (for FilePath manipulation) with Path.Combine from variable strings, _WITHOUT DELETING THE STARTING STRING_ to use it as a reference.\n\nPutting the cursor just before the $@, and typing ‘Path’+‘.’ causes the cursor to jump from the end of Path to _after_ the $@\" before adding the ‘.’ screwing up the ‘Path.Combine(’.\n\nthe ‘before’ screenshot shows the basic set up, to the point of typing ‘Path’ but just before typing the ‘.’  \nthe ‘after’ screenshot shows the result of having typed the ‘.’, and where the cursor jumped to.\n\nPutting a space between the $@\" and the cursor before typing ‘Path’+‘.’ results in the same thing.\n\nWhile setting up the screenshots provided, I found that losing focus on the window (whether alt+tab, or the screenshot app opening), caused this problem to not happen and the behavior became the expected one: ie, you would end up with ‘Path.$@\"’ properly. However, normal usage (ie: coding and typing without interruption) results in the errant behavior that corrupts the desired code.\n\nThe causes significant delays when trying to refactor code, as this so called “help” by autocomplete while typing at speed creates substantial confusion. Moving the cursor changes the expected IntelliSense values, context menus (and their defaults) resulting in a lot of incorrect code that needs to be redone multiple times (as the autocomplete keeps making the error over and over again)\n\nEdit: re-uploaded screenshots as attachments to description.  not sure if both were correctly saved before original attachment\n\n[before.2023-11-08 08_41_55-Greenshot.png](https://aka.ms/dc/file?name=Bcf2d141351d9499a8316eaf2f80aa3df638350540231269368_before.2023-11-08_08_41_55-Greenshot.png&tid=cf2d141351d9499a8316eaf2f80aa3df638350540231269368)\n\n[fixed.after.2023-11-08 08_44_47-Greenshot.png](https://aka.ms/dc/file?name=B5358ee0a819d4968ab92b0c80649b256638350539824828975_fixed.after.2023-11-08_08_44_47-Greenshot.png&tid=5358ee0a819d4968ab92b0c80649b256638350539824828975)\n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 11/8/2023, 08:32 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70749","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Autocomplete jumps the cursor forward around Interpolated strings\" (#70749)"},{"Id":"1986401960","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-09T21:06:00","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"70748","RawContent":null,"Title":"When I convert an \"if\" statement containing a checked expression into a conditional expression in the c# editor, it is converted to unintended code.","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/When-I-convert-an-if-statement-contain/10511087)._\n\n---\n\\[severity:It bothers me.

The app is supposed to run in Azure AppService as a WebJob, so I can't publish it framework-dependent (desktop sdk can't be installed in an app service), so I have to publish it as self-contained. I don't use WPF or WinForms. However, when I publish the app as self-contained, whole desktop sdk (including WPF and WinForms binaries) is copied to the publish folder. I tried trimming, and I know that trimming is not supported by these frameworks. But I also tried using project properties like `<UseWPF>false</UseWPF>`, and that didn't help as well. \r\n\r\nSo, while I know what self-contained publishing means, I believe that such large chunks of binaries which represent whole frameworks like WPF, should be possible to exclude from publishing.\r\n\r\nEdit: additional info\r\nI tried to isolate this issue in a separate minimized app. I found out that without any additional package references the app is published without WPF and other extra binaries. Then I did some experiments with packages I use, and narrowed down to Aure.Identity->Microsoft.Identity.Client dependency tree. So dependency on this Microsoft.Identity.Client caused pulling in all those WPF and WinForms binaries. It seems to be dependent on Wpf and Winforms libraries when targeting desktop framework. Is there any way to force a package reference to restoring using TFM different from project's one?\r\nIs it possible to exclude Wpf and WinForms frameworks from publishing when I'm sure they won't be used?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/assets/12996633/01d5ed13-ce1c-4df9-9bd7-dcf9c4e0ccb0)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/36790","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Self-contained Microsoft.WindowsDesktop-targeting app is published with whole WPF and WinForms frameworks which are not used\" (#36790)"},{"Id":"1987486828","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-10T11:57:43","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"36789","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/7.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2b57cf1e-5efe-45fe-1396-08da7ef5fa55)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 2b57cf1e-5efe-45fe-1396-08da7ef5fa55\r\n- **Build**: 20231106.6\r\n- **Date Produced**: November 6, 2023 11:24:16 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 0cf959c996dd33379cb6e87532c008669e0ae06f\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/7.0\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.23511.9 to 7.0.0-beta.23556.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.23511.9 to 7.0.0-beta.23556.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool**: [from 7.0.0-beta.23511.9 to 7.0.0-beta.23556.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions**: [from 7.0.0-beta.23511.9 to 7.0.0-beta.23556.6][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/acb831a5b3...0cf959c996\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:2b57cf1e-5efe-45fe-1396-08da7ef5fa55)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/36789","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/7.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#36789)"},{"Id":"1987332149","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-10T10:15:40","Actor":"joeloff","Number":"36787","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simplify and improve signature verification for workloads on Windows","State":"open","Body":"# Description\r\n\r\nImprove code signing verification on Windows for workloads (MSI based installs)\r\n\r\n* Add revocation checks when calling `WinVerifyTrust`.

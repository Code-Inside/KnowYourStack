As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

A larger fix may be appropriate for 17.8.\r\n\r\nThis change differs from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69339 in that the approach taken is to not have two taggers (one for 'visible' and one for 'above/below') but instead have 3 taggers (one for 'above', one for 'visible' and one for 'below').  This is extremely simple, and involves no change in state management.  \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBackstory: Tagging was updated in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/67698 to introduce the following idea.  First, the user's buffer would be split into the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--------------------------\r\n|       Untagged         |\r\n|------------------------|\r\n| Above the visible view |\r\n|------------------------|\r\n|                        |\r\n|     The visible view   |\r\n|                        |\r\n|------------------------|\r\n| Below the visible view |\r\n--------------------------\r\n|       Untagged         |\r\n--------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this we would tag everything in the above/middle/below section at the same cadence.  This was often very fast (since we want the editor to do things like responsively colorize), but had the downside that we were often tagging sections of the document the user may not see.  We still wanted these sections tagged though so that scrolling/navigation nearby where the user was coding would not show ugly pop-in of tags.\r\n\r\nWith the above PR, there were now *two* effective regions we tagged.  The 'visible' region (tagged with the same feature-level cadence from before), and the non-visible region (tagged at much slower cadence).  By doign this, we still use the necessary resources for what a user can see, but we significantly dropped memory and CPU for the regions the user could not.\r\n\r\nThis worked well for all taggers *except* for classification.  Specifically, due to how some data was managed in the tagging stack, when classification participated in the above, *stale* information about the above/below region could stick around, then showing bogus results when text changed in the visible region.  For example, if you commented out code, you might still see some semantic classification tags stick around perpetually.\r\n\r\nThe cause for this was due to stored data in the tagging stack which didn't play nicely with the above assumptions.  *Specifically*, when a tagger runs, it is allowed to tell the tagging engine \"here is the region i *actually* tagged\" (versus the region they were *requested* to tag).  This happens with semantic classification because the semantic classifier can be smart and can tag a subset of hte requested region when it sees, for example, that an edit was entirely within a method body.  There's no need to classify outside of hte method body as the edit could not affect it.  This narrowing of the requested region then allows less CPU/memory to be needed to tag that portion, and less diff'ing against the prior tags to notify as to what has changed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these two systems didn't play well together.  Specifically, when classifying the above/below sections,  the 'above' region would first say \"i actually classified span [x,y)\".  However, when classifying teh 'below' region, that information would be *overwritten* saying \"i actually classified span [a, b)\" (losing the [x, y)) span.  \r\n\r\nBecause we didn't even realize we were classifying the different parts, we didn't update the information properly for a portion of the buffer, allowing stale data to creep in.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn the future, the cleaner approach (IMO) is to not have hte actual tagging step overwrite this at all.  But, rather, have the tag engine do a pre-call (on the background) into the actual tagger, saying \"here are the spans we think you should tag, if you think a different set should be tagged instead, please give us those\".

FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.9 or SDK 7.0.109 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.20 or SDK 6.0.315 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n* If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1 and consuming the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity package, update that package to version [2.1.39](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/2.1.39)\r\n.NET 6.0 and and .NET 7.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"},{"Id":"1440661312","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:01:14","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"239","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET, .NET Core and .NET Framework's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient libraries where a timeout occurring under high load can cause incorrect data to be returned as the result of an asynchronously executed query.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/78042\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf you are not talking to Microsoft SQL Server from your application you are not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\n[System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/) | <=4.8.4 | 4.8.5\r\n[Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/) | <= 1.1.3, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.1.0, 2.1.1 | 1.1.4, >=2.1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. \r\n\r\nFor example, the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package depends on the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core package. When you add a dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core. \r\n \r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the  [affected packages](#affected-packages) listed above are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Framework you must install the November update for .NET Framework\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Core, .NET 5 or .NET 6 you must update the nuget package to an updated version as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n* If you are using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, anywhere (.NET Core, .NET 5/6, .NET Framework) and you are using a version that is vulnerable you must update as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the difference between Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient please read the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient initial announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/)  for an explanation,\r\n\r\n**Additional Details**\r\n\r\n.NET and .NET Framework projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, .NET Framework users must also install the November 2022 security patch to be protected. \r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your csproj file. They can be fixed by editing the project file or using nuget command line to update the dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. Transitive dependencies can be discovered by searching the project.assets.json file for each of your projects. This file is produced on each build and is in the obj directory for each project. \r\n\r\nThe project.assets.json files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are nuget packages that have been specifically added to a project, rather than being pulled in because a nuget package added requires it. They can be seen in the solution explorer in Visual Studio or by opening the csproj for the project and examining the packageReference nodes for the package name, specified by the Include parameter, and its version, specified by the Version parameter.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the following project file has a direct dependency on version 2.1.1 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies with the nuget command line \r\n\r\nOpen a command line to the directory holding your project \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies by editing the project file \r\n\r\nOpen projectname.csproj in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose Edit projectname.csproj from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.  \r\n\r\nLook for PackageReference elements. The following shows an example project file: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference tone of the vulnerable packages as seen by the single PackageReference element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute. \r\nThe package version number is in the Version attribute. \r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed in the Affected software section of this document. \r\n\r\nIn this example, update Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to the appropriate fixed version for your major version. Save the csproj file. The example csproj now looks as follows: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated csproj file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. \r\n\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the updated dependencies. \r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package. \r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nRebuild your solution and then open the project.assets.json file from in each of your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing. \r\n\r\nSearch the project.assets.json file for the vulnerable packages above using the format packagename/ for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search: \r\n\r\nExamine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the /. \r\n\r\nCompare to the vulnerable versions \r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows \"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\": \"2.1.0\" is a reference to version 2.1.0 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient If your project.assets.json file includes vulnerable versions of the nuget packages then you need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either \r\n\r\nNone of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or \r\n\r\nYou have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the vulnerable package, you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your csproj file to override the transitive dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Editing projects to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen projectname.csproj in your editor. Look for PackageReference nodes, for example: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated, matching major/minor version of the vulnerable by adding it to the csproj file. This is done by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version. For example,  \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your csproj file. \r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated csproj file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Using the nuget command line to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen a command window and change directory to your project directory.  \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between versions 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\nExecute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application \r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy. \r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 6.0, please email details to [secure@microsoft.com](secure@microsoft.com).

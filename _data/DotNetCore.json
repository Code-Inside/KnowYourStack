All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system)\r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project)\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu)\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness)\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker)\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools)\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf)\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**.

Particularly `_EH_prolog3_catch_GS_align`/`_EH_epilog3_GS_align` had a `mov esp, ebx` instruction the lazy unwinding didn't handle. This helper ended up getting called by 3 FCalls in all coreclr: \r\n\r\n- `DebugDebugger::Log`\r\n- `StubHelpers::ValidateObjec`\r\n- `COMDelegate::BindToMethodName`\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers will see seeing seemingly random behavior once one of these stubs is hit. This manifests as GC holes where the stack walking caused the GC to not find stack roots, effectively unrooting object with references in the stack. A customer reported this from their use of `Debug.WriteLine` .\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with respect to previous releases. The regression was caused by a native toolset update in the build agents.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nA repro app that used to crash in under a second using GC stress ran successfully for 12+hrs with no issues. \r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nVery targeted fix, both @jkotas and I have stepped through the unwinder logic and it's as minimally invasive as possible while preserving correctness.

This makes me believe that the issue is somehow connected with the new command line parser.\r\n\r\nGmodNET.VersionTool is still working as expected on machines with only .NET 5 SDK installed (for example in our CI builds (https://github.com/GmodNET/GmodDotNet/actions/runs/579674038) of the project for which the version tool was developed)."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"595536249","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-07T13:22:05","Actor":"david-driscoll","Number":"182","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding

Fix lazy machine state unwinding for MSVC epilogues on x86","State":"open","Body":"# Description\r\n\r\nMSVC introduced changes into their prologue/epilogue helpers. Particularly `_EH_prolog3_catch_GS_align`/`_EH_epilog3_GS_align` had a `mov esp, ebx` instruction the lazy unwinding didn't handle. This helper ended up getting called by 3 FCalls in all coreclr: \r\n\r\n- `DebugDebugger::Log`\r\n- `StubHelpers::ValidateObjec`\r\n- `COMDelegate::BindToMethodName`\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers will see seeing seemingly random behavior once one of these stubs is hit. This manifests as GC holes where the stack walking caused the GC to not find stack roots, effectively unrooting object with references in the stack. A customer reported this from their use of `Debug.WriteLine` .\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with respect to previous releases. The regression was caused by a native toolset update in the build agents.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nA repro app that used to crash in under a second using GC stress ran successfully for 12+hrs with no issues. \r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nVery targeted fix, both @jkotas and I have stepped through the unwinder logic and it's as minimally invasive as possible while preserving correctness.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"705166145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-20T19:05:41","Actor":"Korporal","Number":"1775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confusing behavior when using AssemblyInfo.cs ","State":"open","Body":"I'm completely perplexed.\r\n\r\nI created a .Net Standard 2.0 library project.\r\n\r\nI explicity added an AssemblyInfo.cs file, we need this because we use this utility to \"stamp\" our assemblies when we build them:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ygoe/NetRevisionTool\r\n\r\nThat utility is run as a pre/post build event and temporarily replaces placeholders in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute with runtime values (like repo folder name, commit ID, branch etc etc).\r\n\r\nThe completed assembly then has this info \"burned\" into it as we go forward.\r\n\r\n.Net Standard is not working with this.\r\n\r\n1.

Due to this reason it seems rather unfortunate that the compiler currently forces me to deal with these false nullability warnings if I want to do something with the first component of the resulting tuple but cannot cast it to the underlying struct for any reason.\r\n\r\nThis one might be related to other tuple conversion issues but doesn't seem exactly the same as any of them: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/50670, https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47892","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/51321","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Roslyn loses information on nullable unlifting conversions in tuple components (but tracks them if you cast it component by component)\" (#51321)"},{"Id":"811457557","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-18T21:24:23","Actor":"dibarbet","Number":"51320","RawContent":null,"Title":"Apply comment selection text changes directly to the text buffer inst…","State":"closed","Body":"…ead of going through the workspace.\r\n\r\nFixes https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1266024?src=WorkItemMention&src-action=artifact_link\r\n\r\nNote that anycode should implement workspace apply changes properly, bug here - https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1280509\r\n\r\nHowever there's no need to apply through the workspace here, we can just apply to the buffer in the command handler","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/51320","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Apply comment selection text changes directly to the text buffer inst…\" (#51320)"},{"Id":"811381920","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-18T20:31:36","Actor":"JoeRobich","Number":"51313","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert ToggleCompletionMode command name to its canonical name","State":"closed","Body":"[Integration tests are failing in the scouting queue](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=1000536&view=ms.vss-test-web.build-test-results-tab&runId=31286510&resultId=100397&paneView=debug).\r\n\r\nIn 16.9 Preview 4 the platform has fixed the ToggleCompletionMode command name and we are now failing with this error.\r\n```\r\nSystem.AggregateException : One or more errors occurred.\r\n---- System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException : Command \"Edit.ToggleIntelliSensesuggestioncompletionmode\" is not valid.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts the WellKnowCommandName back to the canonical name and hardcodes the integration queue to the scouting queue. \r\n\r\nOnce this change had flowed into master-vs-deps we can update our pipeline's `queueName` variable and undo the hardcoding.

Adding an explicit cast by hand, i.e., to make the offending line read `_foo = (IFoo<T>)foo;` makes the IDE \"dim\" the cast, and raise `IDE0004` saying cast is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis is bizarro.  \r\n\r\nIt works just fine and compiles without errors if I dependency-inject in the constructor:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class MyClass<T> : IBar<T>\r\n{\r\n    /* field */\r\n    private readonly IFoo<T> _foo;\r\n\r\n    public MyClass(IFoo<T> foo)\r\n    {\r\n        _foo = foo;    // compiles fine\r\n    }\r\n    /* ... */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is just plain weird: First of all, `CS0266` is telling me the compiler cannot convert a class to itself (?? huh ??) and then it will compile dependency-injection just fine but not the fluent method.\r\n\r\nWhat is going on?  I am wondering if this is even reproducible. I am just plain flummoxed.  I have deep experience coding in C#, so I think I know what I am doing (i.e., this is not some \"n00b mistake\").\r\n\r\n**What I've Tried**\r\nFile > Reload Workspace -> did not work; Close VS, delete `bin` and `obj` folders, re open VS, do a `Rebuild Solution` -> did not work.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/51302","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Compiler complains with error CS0266 that cannot convert 'FooLib.IFoo<T>' to 'FooLib.IFoo<T>'.

6.0.100-preview.1.21103.13","State":"open","Body":"Possibly relates to #15541 and #15767.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n`dotnet tool run` is not able to pass arguments to cli tool (seems like).\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nI've developed a small version tool for my projects to use as .NET CLI tool: https://www.nuget.org/packages/GmodNET.VersionTool/1.0.1\r\n\r\nAfter installing first public preview of .NET 6 SDK (6.0.100-preview.1.21103.13) I was not able to call my tool using `dotnet tool run`.\r\n\r\n1) Create a local git repository (GmodNET.VersionTool  uses git information for generating versions).\r\n2) Add at least one commit to repository.\r\n3) Install GmodNET.VersionTool 1.0.1 as local .NET tool.\r\n4) Add a file called `version.json` at the root of the repository with the following content:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"Version\": \"0.7.0-beta.2\",\r\n  \"Codename\": \"UstIlimsk\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n5) Generate a version by running `dotnet tool run gmodnet-vt getVersion version.json`.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nTool must generate and print a version number (something like `0.7.0-beta.2.32934270.main+codename.UstIlimsk.head.main.commit.d8fcbfe`).\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nOperation fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nUnrecognized command or argument 'getVersion'\r\nUnrecognized command or argument 'version.json'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nOS: Microsoft Windows 10 20H2 (build 19042.804)\r\n\r\n## Remarks\r\nAfter setting dotnet sdk version back to something stable (5.0.103) via `global.json`, the tool works as expected again. This makes me believe that the issue is somehow connected with the new command line parser.\r\n\r\nGmodNET.VersionTool is still working as expected on machines with only .NET 5 SDK installed (for example in our CI builds (https://github.com/GmodNET/GmodDotNet/actions/runs/579674038) of the project for which the version tool was developed).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/15961","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet tool run is not working properly with .net 6.0.100-preview.1.21103.13\" (#15961)"},{"Id":"811562578","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-18T23:49:15","Actor":"iamphi","Number":"15960","RawContent":null,"Title":"Executable from `dotnet publish` for Apple Silicon is not working. .net 6 preview 1.","State":"open","Body":"Test script:\r\n```\r\nmkdir helloworld\r\ncd helloworld \r\ndotnet new console\r\n\r\necho \"### Testing dotnet run\"\r\ndotnet run\r\n\r\necho \"### Testing intel publish\"\r\ndotnet publish --self-contained -r osx-x64 -o intel\r\nlipo -info intel/helloworld\r\n./intel/helloworld                                                     \r\n\r\necho \"### Testing arm64 publish\"\r\ndotnet publish --self-contained -r osx-arm64 -o arm64\r\nlipo -info arm64/helloworld\r\n./arm64/helloworld \r\n```\r\n\r\nMy output:\r\n```\r\nThe template \"Console Application\" was created successfully.\r\n\r\nProcessing post-creation actions...\r\nRunning 'dotnet restore' on /Users/phi/ws/helloworld/helloworld.csproj...\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n  Restored /Users/phi/ws/helloworld/helloworld.csproj (in 138 ms).\r\nRestore succeeded.\r\n\r\n### Testing dotnet run\r\nHello World!\r\n### Testing intel publish\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.9.0-preview-21103-02+198f3f262 for .NET\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there.

We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

If you don’t supply contact details, then responses will be anonymous.\r\n\r\n[Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZLPVNX9?SourceRepo=dotnet%2Fannouncements)\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nFor discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36235.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/154","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Survey: repo contribution experience\" (#154)"},{"Id":"610977267","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-01T21:27:32","Actor":"brianrob","Number":"153","RawContent":null,"Title":"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core","State":"open","Body":"# JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\r\nIn November 2019, Intel announced the Jump Conditional Code (JCC) erratum which may occur under conditions involving jump instructions that span 64-byte boundaries.  Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1362601036498669569","CreatedAt":"2021-02-19T03:12:57+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"CoreWCF 0.1.0 GA Release https://t.co/93aSRSnf8y","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":43,"FavoriteCount":16,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1362555502505455616","CreatedAt":"2021-02-19T00:12:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"&lt;3 this overview...

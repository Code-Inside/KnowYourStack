The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Especially with all the performance-related analyzer suggestions that .NET 8 added elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## Benchmark\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n[MemoryDiagnoser(displayGenColumns: false)]\r\npublic class Benchmarks\r\n{\r\n    private readonly List<int> _list = new();\r\n\r\n    [Params(10, 100, 1_000, 100_000, 1_000_000)]\r\n    public int Count { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [GlobalSetup]\r\n    public void Setup()\r\n    {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < Count; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            _list.Add(i);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [GlobalCleanup]\r\n    public void Cleanup()\r\n    {\r\n        _list.Clear();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Benchmark]\r\n    public int[] ToArray_Linq()\r\n    {\r\n        return _list.ToArray();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Benchmark]\r\n    public int[] ToArray_Literal()\r\n    {\r\n        return [.. _list];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd here are the results on my machine;\r\n```\r\nBenchmarkDotNet v0.13.8, Windows 11 (10.0.22621.2283/22H2/2022Update/SunValley2)\r\nAMD Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U with Radeon Graphics, 1 CPU, 12 logical and 6 physical cores\r\n.NET SDK 8.0.100-rc.1.23455.8\r\n  [Host]     : .NET 8.0.0 (8.0.23.41904), X64 RyuJIT AVX2\r\n  DefaultJob : .NET 8.0.0 (8.0.23.41904), X64 RyuJIT AVX2\r\n\r\n\r\n| Method          | Count   | Mean            | Error          | StdDev         | Ratio | RatioSD | Allocated  | Alloc Ratio |\r\n|---------------- |-------- |----------------:|---------------:|---------------:|------:|--------:|-----------:|------------:|\r\n| ToArray_Linq    | 10      |        14.64 ns |       0.353 ns |       0.911 ns |  1.00 |    0.00 |       64 B |        1.00 |\r\n| ToArray_Literal | 10      |        83.89 ns |       1.667 ns |       2.546 ns |  5.79 |    0.39 |      280 B |        4.38 |\r\n|                 |         |                 |                |                |       |         |            |             |\r\n| ToArray_Linq    | 100     |        33.40 ns |       0.726 ns |       1.516 ns |  1.00 |    0.00 |      424 B |        1.00 |\r\n| ToArray_Literal | 100     |       390.53 ns |      10.235 ns |      29.695 ns | 11.67 |    0.92 |     1608 B |        3.79 |\r\n|                 |         |                 |                |                |       |         |            |             |\r\n| ToArray_Linq    | 1000    |       213.75 ns |       4.800 ns |      13.618 ns |  1.00 |    0.00 |     4024 B |        1.00 |\r\n| ToArray_Literal | 1000    |     3,241.95 ns |      84.984 ns |     245.200 ns | 15.24 |    1.54 |    12448 B |        3.09 |\r\n|                 |         |                 |                |                |       |         |            |             |\r\n| ToArray_Linq    | 100000  |   173,960.87 ns |   3,476.459 ns |   8,329.374 ns |  1.00 |    0.00 |   400066 B |        1.00 |\r\n| ToArray_Literal | 100000  |   535,941.57 ns |  10,345.524 ns |  11,069.595 ns |  3.09 |    0.14 |  1449123 B |        3.62 |\r\n|                 |         |                 |                |                |       |         |            |             |\r\n| ToArray_Linq    | 1000000 | 1,294,022.79 ns |  25,686.070 ns |  27,483.807 ns |  1.00 |    0.00 |  4000091 B |        1.00 |\r\n| ToArray_Literal | 1000000 | 7,649,278.75 ns | 184,894.259 ns | 515,411.292 ns |  5.83 |    0.56 | 12389341 B |        3.10 |\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWasn't sure whether this is a runtime or a Roslyn issue.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

However, this conflicts with the simplifying assumption we made by calling `SetCount` then `AsSpan` just once. We'd get bad results if we, for example, just called AddRange on the underlying list--elements would be added at the wrong position, and so on. We'd have to do some kind of interleaving of SetCount+AsSpan/AddRange/SetCount+AsSpan/... to make things work.\r\n\r\nThe impl of List.AddRange is useful as a point of reference here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/6f30b7500ea2c0d0fb2923ea1fc5ed3c4ce2f29c/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Collections/Generic/List.cs#L243\r\n\r\nWhat we would ideally do to make it straightforward to insert the spread elements is either:\r\n1. access the underlying array of the List and pass it in to ICollection<T>.CopyTo(T[], index), as AddRange is doing internally\r\n2. Use a runtime API under consideration to try and convert IEnumerables to ReadOnlySpan, then use CopyTo: dotnet/runtime#58821\r\n3. Use some hypothetical new CollectionsMarshal API to, for example, create a `T[]` and move ownership of it to a new `List<T>`\r\n\r\nNote that even if we had say, `[bunch, of, scalars, ..spread1, bunch, of, scalars]`, where `spread1` is convertible to ICollection but not Span, it might still be desirable to use `AsSpan`, as it does seem to meaningfully reduce the overhead of inserting the scalar elements into the list compared to calling `Add`. So, we wouldn't want to necessarily see a spread of an ICollection and fall back to completely using Add/AddRange instead of Span.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/71273","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Rationalize spread optimization targeting List when collection-expr contains spread values of

As part of that PR, we added an additional check to try to prevent duplicate entries from getting through and creating solutions that wouldn't build.\r\n\r\nThat logic tries to find a duplicate project and then detect if any part of the solution folder matched any existing solution folder. This is wrong as it's only if an identically named project or solution folder is parented to the same exact solution folder. You can have lots of folders with the same name as long as they are in different hierarchies (ie have different parents)\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nThis was blocking some customers who had identically named projects in slightly different solution folders.\r\n\r\n## Risk: low\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTested a lot of different manual scenarios of new projects and different hierarchy of solutions.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

A patch for this vulnerability (nicknamed \"Rapid Reset\") is being released in coordination with other industry partners.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server where a malicious client may flood the server with specially crafted HTTP/2 requests, causing denial of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at   https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51264\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nServers without HTTP/2 enabled are not affected.\r\nTo limit your application to HTTP1.1 via config, edit your appsettings.json to include a protocols setting for each endpoint: \r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"Kestrel\": { \r\n    \"Endpoints\": { \r\n      \"http\": { \r\n        // your existing config \r\n        \"Protocols\": \"Http1\" \r\n      }, \r\n      \"https\": { \r\n         // your existing config \r\n        \"Protocols\": \"Http1\" \r\n      } \r\n    } \r\n  } \r\n```\r\nVisit [Configure options for the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/options?view=aspnetcore-7.0) to learn more about creating config files.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also limit kestrel via code, in your program.cs / Main() function by added the highlighted code to the listen options for each of your endpoints: \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); \r\nbuilder.WebHost.UseKestrel(options => \r\n{ \r\n    options.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5000, listenOptions => \r\n    { \r\n        listenOptions.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http1; \r\n    }); \r\n}); \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any ASP.NET Core 6.0 application running on .NET 6.0.22 or earlier.\r\n* Any ASP.NET Core 7.0 application running on .NET 7.0.11 or earlier.\r\n* Any ASP.NET Core 8.0 application running on .NET 8.0 RC1 or earlier.\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0 RC2 Runtime  or .NET 8.0 RC2 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.13 or SDK 7.0.113 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.24 or SDK 6.0.319 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0 and and .NET 7.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

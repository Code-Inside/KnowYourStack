This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK or .NET Core Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET. As Canonical does not build/publish .2xx and higher SDK feature bands due to breaking changes, new Snap will only support .1xx SDK feature band for the lifetime of a major .NET version.\r\n- .NET previews (.NET 9 previews) will not be available to install via Snap.\r\n\r\n   _Stay tuned for date and call to action to switch from old to new .NET Snaps._\r\n\r\n### Issue Log\r\nAfter ownership is transferred from Microsoft to Canonical in May, log any .NET Snap issues to the dotnet-snap repository under the Canonical org [https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcanonical%2Fdotnet-snap&data=05%7C02%7Cashitanagar%40microsoft.com%7Cc5b9b895923f4c11483908dc57efcb4c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638481934634983274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fvusMJ%2Fl94m3WaJvpM7kK85%2BzIXGLsenPt7BmKPtRSU%3D&reserved=0).\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n[.NET SDK Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-sdk)\r\n[Canonical GitHub Repository](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap)\r\n"},{"Id":"37311676843","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T18:22:02","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/303","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\" (#303) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 8.0.

the above I think the diagnostic message should simply be adjusted here to indicate that the user should use `in` at the call side instead.\r\n\r\nI personally found it surprising that `ref` was not permitted here, because other kinds of arguments can be passed using `ref` for this parameter without issue. It was not obvious to me that using `ref` was actually requiring the argument to be a writable reference, even though the parameter will not assign to the referent.\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"38344986142","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-14T03:30:04","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/40855","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating\" (#40855) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:bdbeb850-6d82-4277-c391-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/templating\r\n- **Subscription**: bdbeb850-6d82-4277-c391-08d8e9750d9d\r\n- **Build**: 20240513.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: May 14, 2024 3:06:05 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: f372e2641a0e9ce4bc7a6f3df19ae22e0ea62160\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

design](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/csharp-12.0/ref-readonly-parameters.md#value-kind-checks). @jjonescz are there notes handy for why the design is this way?\r\n\r\nGiven the above I think the diagnostic message should simply be adjusted here to indicate that the user should use `in` at the call side instead.\r\n\r\nI personally found it surprising that `ref` was not permitted here, because other kinds of arguments can be passed using `ref` for this parameter without issue. It was not obvious to me that using `ref` was actually requiring the argument to be a writable reference, even though the parameter will not assign to the referent.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73459","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Diagnostic is unclear when passing ref readonly to ref readonly parameter using 'ref'\" (#73459)"},{"Id":"2293883904","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T22:49:44","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"73456","RawContent":null,"Title":"Optimize suppress operations during formatting.

Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-operates-on-outdated-cache/10649921)._\n\n---\n[severity:It's more difficult to complete my work] [regression] [worked-in:a few versions ago, maybe 17.8]\nThis is the same issue as https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-operates-on-outdated-cache/10161097 again since the same problem has come back:\n\nWhen you git pull changes to files currently not opened in the editor and then run a codefix on project or solution level that will modify a file that was changed by the git pull, the codefix will undo the changes you’ve previously git pull’d.\n\nIn addition, if a file currently opened in the editor references members that are currently not open in the editor and were added in the latest git pull, those will have a red squiggly. The squiggly disappears if you open the file containing the added members.\n\nIn addition, even though the build worked fine, if you start debugging, halt at a breakpoint and then try to take a step, E&C will report errors due to changes you've supposedly made that cannot be applied.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Download and extract attached Repro.zip\n2. Navigate to the Checkout directory and open Repro.sln\n3. Open Program.cs in the editor and perform a build\n4. Open the git changes blade and click on pull\n5. In Program.cs, bring up the light bulb menu on the second line where it says using System.IO;\n6. Navigate to Remove Unnecessary Usings and in the preview pane, click on Fix all occurrences in: Project\n7. Accept the proposed changes.\n8. Review the changes made in the git changes blade, specifically OtherFile.cs.\n8. The unnecessary usings were removed but the comment inside the OtherFile class, // these changes will be undone after applying the codefix, that was pulled in step 4, was removed as well.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/1/2024, 09:03 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73455","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Visual Studio operates on outdated cache after git pull again\" (#73455)"},{"Id":"2293815627","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T20:49:22","Actor":"jaredpar","Number":"73454","RawContent":null,"Title":"net9.0 reference assemblies","State":"open","Body":"Trying to figure out what is going on with #73423","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73454","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"net9.0 reference assemblies\" (#73454)"},{"Id":"2293809331","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T20:45:22","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"73453","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rename class property changes all occurrences of property name in all comments in project.","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Rename-class-property-changes-all-occurr/10656858)._\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm running into an issue with the renaming feature in my Visual Studio installation (17.9.6) where rather than just renaming the property, all comments containing the word (relevant to the class or not) are found and updated with the new word. A bit confusing I know but please read on for more details.\r\n\r\nExplaining the problem:\r\n\r\nThe first problem is that when I try to rename a property the dialog box doesn't show the 'Include comments' or 'Include strings' options as it did before. I thought this wouldnt be an issue since those are not enabled by default anyways or at least shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can see in this screenshot, my rename of this class property is leading to 82 references in 50 files.\r\nI found that the discrepency between the 5 references to the property and the 82 that VS found is due to 77 instances of the word 'Value' in comments scattered throughout the project I'm working on.\r\n\r\n![B26a9547fc1f94d9a804b2cb320718d2a638509196964410693_20240510-163454-image](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/1408396/68827765-b368-46f9-8597-beea6128e530)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give more context, the examples where the word in a comment is being 'renamed' are almost never relevant to the class/ property itself, e.g. \r\n\r\n![Ba1af19cfa80749d8ab0a371cf1241b40638509200439211767_20240510-164042-image](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/1408396/9e590723-a21f-4da3-aca3-4561d1aa5813)\r\n\r\n\r\n To verify that I wasn't going crazy, I tested this with a new property that has zero references called 'test'. As you can see once again it is picking up all instances of the word 'test' in the comments of the project.\r\n\r\n![B58807dd03d724dbdaa479d4211798efe638509198719801386_20240510-163750-image](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/1408396/4403c689-8d8c-4795-bb7d-ddec89fa870a)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Original Comments\r\n\r\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/10/2024, 03:29 AM: \r\n\r\n(private comment, text removed)\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Original Solutions\r\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Rename class property changes all occurrences of property name in all comments in project.\" (#73453)"},{"Id":"2293692560","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T20:09:45","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"73450","RawContent":null,"Title":"Avoid lots of interval tree allocs during fix all cleanup","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73450","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Avoid lots of interval tree allocs during fix all cleanup\" (#73450)"},{"Id":"2293564683","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T18:49:39","Actor":"dibarbet","Number":"73449","RawContent":null,"Title":"For validation only","State":"open","Body":"testing with client side STJ changes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73449","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"For validation only\" (#73449)"},{"Id":"2293431943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T17:36:14","Actor":"mikelle-rogers","Number":"73448","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hot reload fails to flow generic constraints to the inherited class","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWhen adding a new class with generic constraints and passing it down to the parent class the update seems to apply successfully but the generated type is invalid.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nRun the following program with `dotnet watch` or from Visual Studio and uncomment L10 when the application is running.\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System.Reflection.Metadata;\r\n\r\n[assembly: MetadataUpdateHandler(typeof(MetadataUpdateHandler))]\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Ready..\");\r\n\r\nawait Task.Delay(-1);\r\n\r\npublic interface ICat;\r\ninternal abstract class Holder<T>;\r\n//internal sealed class CatHolder<T> : Holder<T> where T : ICat; //Uncomment this line when the application is running.\r\n\r\ninternal static class MetadataUpdateHandler\r\n{\r\n\tprivate static void UpdateApplication(Type[]?

Copy paste the following code into a REPL, IDE, or [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:D4AQTAjAsAULBKBTAhgEwPIDsA2BPAygA7KYA8ARgPaXYB8ABMvQLz2aIDuAFAC4BOAV0QBKANwIUGHAWJkqNBuRZtOXAGbJsAZxHi4MEBACcXZAG0ADAF0xsQyfKWbeoA==).\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nReadOnlySpan<bool> a = new(true);\r\nReadOnlySpan<bool> b = new(false);\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(a[0]);\r\nConsole.WriteLine(b[0]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run the program or decompile the output. In both Debug and Release, observe that both spans resolve to `false`, which causes the program to output `False` twice.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nprivate static void <Main>$(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n    bool reference = true;\r\n    ReadOnlySpan<bool> readOnlySpan = new ReadOnlySpan<bool>(ref reference);\r\n    reference = false;\r\n    ReadOnlySpan<bool> readOnlySpan2 = new ReadOnlySpan<bool>(ref reference);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(readOnlySpan[0]);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(readOnlySpan2[0]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was discovered while I was writing a library, and finally narrowed it down to these two problematic lines.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n// 'entries' splits by new lines lazily.\r\n// The reference gets assigned to '\\n' at the start.\r\nvar entries = mountTable.AsSpan().SplitOn((byte)'\\n');\r\n\r\nforeach (var entry in entries)\r\n{\r\n    if (entry is [(byte)'#', ..])\r\n        continue;\r\n\r\n    var escaped = entry.SplitOn(s_whitespace)[1];\r\n\r\n    // With the execution of this line, subsequent enumerations\r\n    // split by '\\' instead due to the shared reference.\r\n    var (first, rest) = escaped.SplitOn((byte)'\\\\');\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging this would technically be a breaking change, and I assume that perhaps this is in some way intended for optimization reasons. If altering behavior is not desired, I would strongly suggest there to be a warning when two `in` parameters are used within the same scope and of the same type.\r\n\r\n**Diagnostic Id**:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\nA reference is generated for every value separately, unless it can be proven that sharing the same reference won't affect the program, such as if both variables live in separate scopes and do not have their lifetimes overlap.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\nA shared reference is used between multiple seemingly unrelated values, causing unexpected changes when a different `in`/`ref readonly` method is invoked.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73438","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Possibly unintended reuse of `ref` local to `in`/`ref readonly` parameters causes unexpected mutation\" (#73438)"},{"Id":"2290818941","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-11T19:38:42","Actor":"thompson-tomo","Number":"73434","RawContent":null,"Title":"#71952 Optimise dependencies based on TFM","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #71952 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73434","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"#71952 Optimise dependencies based on TFM\" (#73434)"},{"Id":"2291017377","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-11T18:16:40","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"73437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Partial properties: attributes","State":"open","Body":"Test plan: #73090 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73437","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Partial properties: attributes\" (#73437)"},{"Id":"2291011158","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-11T17:58:23","Actor":"alrz","Number":"73436","RawContent":null,"Title":"[API Proposal] Linq-like APIs for analyzers","State":"open","Body":"This was implemented for generators but never ported back to analyzers.

This does neither by converting the NRE into a new exception type at the point where the exception might be expected, then catching it and logging an error at the top level.\r\n\r\nAlso let me know if you want me to push the catch (AcceptableNullReferenceException) down the stack a bit.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/40851","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Exception --> logged error in ResolvePackageAssets\" (#40851)"},{"Id":"2293843957","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T21:05:18","Actor":"abpiskunov","Number":"40849","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port changes from VS where we stopped using custom tracing event arguments class based on BinaryFormatter","State":"open","Body":"Port changes from VS where we stopped using custom tracing event arguments class based on BinaryFormatter:\r\n  - instead of CustomBuildWithPropertiesEventArgs use ExtendedCustomBuildEventArgs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/40849","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Port changes from VS where we stopped using custom tracing event arguments class based on BinaryFormatter\" (#40849)"},{"Id":"2293883367","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T20:02:21","Actor":"voroninp","Number":"40850","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot update maui workload.","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nwhen I run `dotnet workload update` or `dotnet workload install maui`, I get the following error:\r\n> Downloading Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Win2D.WinUI.Desktop.Msi.x64 (8.0.21)\r\nWorkload installation failed.

This profile was saved by Visual Studio to the file \"IISProfile1.pubxml\", in the example above.\r\n- and directory called \"Compile\" next to (on the same level as) the project directory, which is where the \"compile.log\" specified in the command, is to be written\r\n- Run the command as Administrator\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n.NET SDK:\r\n Version:           8.0.204\r\n Commit:            c338c7548c\r\n Workload version:  8.0.200-manifests.7d36c14f\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17763\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.204\\","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/40841","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[dotnet watch publish] command with -fileLogger switch is broken after updating Visual Studio 2022 from 17.5.3 to 17.9.6\" (#40841)"},{"Id":"2293023042","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T13:02:53","Actor":"FroggieFrog","Number":"40840","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to build on new system","State":"open","Body":"### Description\n\nI have a new computer and tried to build my app, but I'm unable to do so.\r\nThose messages are not helpful, because they do not work.\r\n\r\n![maui_workload](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/assets/6222752/39428886-ae30-4894-bb2a-13f943490083)\r\n\r\nA `dotnet workload update` also does nothing.\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Link to public reproduction project repository\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version with bug\n\n8.0.7 SR2\n\n### Is this a regression from previous behavior?\n\nYes, this used to work in .NET MAUI\n\n### Last version that worked well\n\n8.0.7 SR2\n\n### Affected platforms\n\nAndroid, Windows\n\n### Affected platform versions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Did you find any workaround?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/40840","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to build on new system\" (#40840)"},{"Id":"2290872307","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T07:06:24","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"40831","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:3d9043af-0e17-4eb5-f3e3-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 3d9043af-0e17-4eb5-f3e3-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 20240510.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: May 10, 2024 5:18:03 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 480401b003bfd2eb989c315da5d6b99ad13a968c\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET. As Canonical does not build/publish .2xx and higher SDK feature bands due to breaking changes, new Snap will only support .1xx SDK feature band for the lifetime of a major .NET version.\r\n- .NET previews (.NET 9 previews) will not be available to install via Snap.\r\n\r\n   _Stay tuned for date and call to action to switch from old to new .NET Snaps._\r\n\r\n### Issue Log\r\nAfter ownership is transferred from Microsoft to Canonical in May, log any .NET Snap issues to the dotnet-snap repository under the Canonical org [https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcanonical%2Fdotnet-snap&data=05%7C02%7Cashitanagar%40microsoft.com%7Cc5b9b895923f4c11483908dc57efcb4c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638481934634983274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fvusMJ%2Fl94m3WaJvpM7kK85%2BzIXGLsenPt7BmKPtRSU%3D&reserved=0).\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n[.NET SDK Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-sdk)\r\n[Canonical GitHub Repository](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/304","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Snap Ownership Transfer from Microsoft to Canonical\" (#304)"},{"Id":"2234072927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T18:22:01","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"303","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 8.0.

It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BinaryFormatter is being removed in .NET 9\" (#293)"},{"Id":"2072888869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:52","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"292","RawContent":null,"Title":" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build.

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. \r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/53246\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nThis impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of project templates listed in [affected software](#affected-software). \r\nOther project templates e.g., console applications, MAUI applications, Windows Forms or WPF applications, are not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nThis impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of the below project templates.\r\n\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web API\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)\r\n-\tBlazor Server App\r\n-\tBlazor WebAssembly App\r\n\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you are you using project templates listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you may be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### For existing projects:\r\nIf you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -> New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. \r\n- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/) \r\n- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/) \r\n\r\nIf your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n#### For new projects:\r\nTo remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

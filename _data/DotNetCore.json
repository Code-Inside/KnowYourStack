Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the MCU.  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.

to 3.1 - Fix a native memory leak in EventPipe","State":"closed","Body":"Port of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35924.\r\n\r\nA customer reported a seemingly unbounded memory usage growth over time when using AppInsights: https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/issues/1678.\r\n\r\nEventPipeBuffers were being allocated using `malloc`, and over time this may cause an internal fragmentation within glibc's internal data structure, resulting in a memory leak over time. A usage pattern that worsens this leak is to start tracing, fill up all the buffers, then stop tracing, and repeat that many times. This fix mitigates the issue by making EventPipeBuffer to use ClrVirtualAlloc instead of malloc.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nOn Linux platforms (specifically ones that use glibc), customers may see an unexpected growth in the native heap size over a long period of time if using EventPipe for a long time (ex. using Application Insights Service Profiler), making our first-party and third-party tracing solutions potentially problematic in production scenarios when used for elongated periods of time.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNo, EventPipe buffers were always allocated using malloc.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe fix was tested against the scenario the customer provided and . Additional performance tests that use EventPipe showed minimal performance regression (<4 % in the worst case). \r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nI believe the risk is low - the fix is localized to only 3-lines change and the behavior is well-understood. I have tested the fix locally for the past three weeks for various performance measurements and the fix passed all the runtime tracing tests that I ran locally and all the tests in the CI when I merged https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35924.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28038","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Port to 3.1 - Fix a native memory leak in EventPipe\" (#28038)"},{"Id":"607419146","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-13T16:54:21","Actor":"janvorli","Number":"28036","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port to 3.1 - Fix DynamicMethodDesc::Destroy vs code heap enum. race","State":"closed","Body":"Port of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/713\r\nThere is a race between DynamicMethodDesc::Destroy called from\r\nthe finalizer thread and the MethodDescs enumeration called from\r\nETW::MethodLog::SendEventsForJitMethods at process exit.\r\nDynamicMethodDesc::Destroy cleans up its members m_pSig and\r\nm_pszMethodName and then it calls GetLCGMethodResolver()->Destroy();\r\nThat calls EEJitManager::FreeCodeMemory, which tries to take the\r\nm_CodeHeapCritSec lock.

The implicit ref prevents this or other processes from attempting to destroy the mutex while it is locked. The implicit ref is removed in either of these cases:\r\n      - The mutex gets another reference from within the same process\r\n      - The thread that owns the lock exits and abandons the mutex, at which point that would be the last reference to the mutex and the process would not reference the mutex anymore\r\n  - The implementation based on file locks is less restricted, but for consistency that implementation also follows the same behavior\r\n- There was also a race between an exiting thread abandoning one of its locked named mutexes and another thread releasing the last reference to it, fixed by using the creation/deletion process lock to synchronize\r\n\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34271 in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- Random crashes were seen on Unixes\r\n- When a named mutex is locked and the last reference to it is released from a different thread in any process, the underlying pthread mutex object is destroyed and that has undefined behavior.

If no, what is the benefit of the new feature?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1748","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Is it legal to decompile .NET libraries?\" (#1748)"},{"Id":"595131445","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T13:46:58","Actor":"Nekuskus","Number":"1754","RawContent":null,"Title":"System.TypeInitializationException","State":"open","Body":"I keep getting `System.TypeInitializationException: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Can't find file or assembly 'System.Private.CoreLib, Version=4.0.0.0', Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e` exception after moving my app from .NET Core to .NET Framework 4.7.2.

It is adding .NET Framework configurations to our OOB packages so that they won't require netsandard shims for projects ingesting them and targeting .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nThings that need to happen before merging this PR:\r\n\r\n- [X] Add Net461 configurations to all projects that today ship as NuGet packages and have a .NET Standard asset when consumer targets .NET Framework 4.6.1/4.6.2/4.7/4.7.1/4.7.2/4.8. (This will be done with the first commit, so that it is easier to review this commit by commit.)\r\n- [X] Add Net461 configuration to OpenSSL OOB package which also needs it, but it will be treated specially given that it requires some special types in S.S.C.Algorithms that are not present in 461. (Done with commit 10df782)\r\n- [x] Baseline all of the packages that have new configurations from steps 1 and 2, and now service all packages above that depend on them so that all new package versions will depend on these new packages that have the new configs. After doing this, all of our latest NuGet packages should not require the .NET Standard shims. (Done with 14b5db5)\r\n- [x] Do some extensive testing to make sure API wasn't regressed by adding these new configurations. (I have more info on how I did this here https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42901#issuecomment-611770142).\r\n\r\n**Customer Impact**\r\n\r\nCustomers that have hit problems caused by this issue have been trying to add manual workarounds on their projects and custom logic for deploying. Once this is fixed, customers will have to remove those workarounds from their projects and reference the new packages in order to get the benefits of not needing the extra facades or binding redirects for their application.\r\n\r\n**Regression?**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**Packaging reviewed?**\r\n\r\nIt will involve packaging changes, so it will require a review by packaging experts.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow. We didn't increase Assembly Version in order to not require new binding redirects from apps. The risk here is that we are effectively causing NuGet to use a different asset from the package to pass to the compiler and a different one as well for the implementation, but we did extensive testing to ensure that we were not removing or adding API and that there was no visible difference between the assets that they used to get and the ones they will get now.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42901","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Adding .NET Framework configurations to OOB packages so that they won't require the netstandard shims when targeting .NET Framework\" (#42901)"},{"Id":"599126181","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-13T21:23:23","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"42903","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update BuildTools to rc1-05113-01 (release/2.1)","State":"closed","Body":"/cc @dotnet/maestro-reviewers-core","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42903","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update BuildTools to rc1-05113-01 (release/2.1)\" (#42903)"},{"Id":"597967932","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-10T20:32:09","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"42902","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to preview5","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42902","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to preview5\" (#42902)"},{"Id":"591386734","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-31T22:29:33","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"42899","RawContent":null,"Title":"Stablise the 3.1 branch","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42899","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Stablise the 3.1 branch\" (#42899)"},{"Id":"590339010","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-30T14:37:07","Actor":"s-tarasov","Number":"42898","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update README.md","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42898","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update README.md\" (#42898)"},{"Id":"588584064","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-27T15:18:16","Actor":"joperezr","Number":"42894","RawContent":null,"Title":"Addressing feedback, Documenting TranscodingWriteStream.MaxbyteBuffer Size and Replacing MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse with .ctor since it performs better","State":"closed","Body":"This is porting the last 3 commits that went into https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/33459.\r\n\r\ncc: @Jozkee @ericstj ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42894","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Addressing feedback, Documenting TranscodingWriteStream.MaxbyteBuffer Size and Replacing MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse with .ctor since it performs better\" (#42894)"},{"Id":"588766967","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-26T23:06:51","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"42897","RawContent":null,"Title":"building platforms package","State":"closed","Body":"Related PR https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42872","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42897","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"building platforms package\" (#42897)"},{"Id":"588726249","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-26T22:51:13","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"42896","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr\r\n- **Subscription**: dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5\r\n- **Build**: 20200326.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/26/2020 5:57 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 83c2d68edf0cc18cf06b12fb2d7eb41031676a3f\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Specify which framework to run using '--framework'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's unacceptable as a default experience for samples, and only to enable a more advanced scenario.\r\n\r\nNext approach is to configure the project for the min-support TFM and then mutate via the CLI:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS D:\\git\\testapps\\versioninfo> dotnet run\r\n**.NET Core info**\r\nVersion: 3.1.2\r\nFrameworkDescription: .NET Core 3.1.2\r\nCoreCLR Build: 3.1.2-servicing.20066.2\r\nCoreCLR Hash: fd22fd600a2526a7c58536da0e80325eb710d7f1\r\nCoreFX Build: 3.1.2\r\nCoreFX Hash: e946cebe43a510e8c6476bbc8185d1445df33a1a\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\nOSVersion: Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\r\nOSDescription: Microsoft Windows 10.0.19624\r\nOSArchitecture: X64\r\nProcessorCount: 8\r\n\r\nPS D:\\git\\testapps\\versioninfo> dotnet build /p:TargetFramework=net5.0\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.7.0-preview-20220-01+80e487bff for .NET Core\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

That'd be awesome.\r\n\r\nNot what I want, but I did discover that the following pattern works:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp3.0;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS D:\\git\\testapps\\versioninfo> dotnet run\r\n**.NET Core info**\r\nVersion: 3.1.2\r\nFrameworkDescription: .NET Core 3.1.2\r\nCoreCLR Build: 3.1.2-servicing.20066.2\r\nCoreCLR Hash: fd22fd600a2526a7c58536da0e80325eb710d7f1\r\nCoreFX Build: 3.1.2\r\nCoreFX Hash: e946cebe43a510e8c6476bbc8185d1445df33a1a\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\nOSVersion: Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\r\nOSDescription: Microsoft Windows 10.0.19624\r\nOSArchitecture: X64\r\nProcessorCount: 8\r\n\r\nPS D:\\git\\testapps\\versioninfo> dotnet run -f net5.0\r\n**.NET Core info**\r\nVersion: 5.0.0\r\nFrameworkDescription: .NET 5.0.0-preview.4.20227.9\r\nCoreCLR Build: 5.0.0-preview.4.20227.9\r\nCoreCLR Hash: 6d1f7e01d3429054ec3dcb7c75b3450b9fe1429e\r\nCoreFX Build: 5.0.0-preview.4.20227.9\r\nCoreFX Hash: 6d1f7e01d3429054ec3dcb7c75b3450b9fe1429e\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\nOSVersion: Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19624.0\r\nOSDescription: Microsoft Windows 10.0.19624\r\nOSArchitecture: X64\r\nProcessorCount: 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor clarity, I don't like this approach for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- It is an abomination of the project format.\r\n- It requires including all the TFMs I want to support. This is similar to how RIDs were in 1.0. Super painful.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the existing `dotnet build` support for my use case is satisfactory (super happy it works), but on the other, it seems the scenario is broken for `dotnet run` where `run` and `build` should have parity.\r\n\r\nSo, I think this should be fixed.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better.

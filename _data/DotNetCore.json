It was a way of determining if the Solution instance you had was a Solution that had ever been teh .CurrentSolution of a workspace, or if you had a forked solution off of one of those solutions.  Needing to know if you were one of these has never been clear as to why that's important.  Roslyn operates in snapshots, and attempts to do so in a purely functional fashion.  What does it matter if you were on a .CurrentSolution, or a fork of that, or a fork of that fork?\r\n\r\nAt one point we definitely used this when it came to persisting data.  We didn't want analysis about a fork of a solution to overwrite data in our persistence service corresponding to the primary solution.  However, that code went away ages ago when:\r\n\r\n1. we stopped storing diagnostic information in the persistence layer.\r\n2. we ensured that all persisted data is stored with a checksum.\r\n\r\nAt that point, there was no concern about overwriting data with something invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR gets rid of hte BranchId concept entirely and fixes up any remaining stragglers to get off of it."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"23625651519","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-08-25T03:25:35","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/27440","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn\" (#27440) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:03acf5d2-59bd-494b-c390-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn\r\n- **Subscription**: 03acf5d2-59bd-494b-c390-08d8e9750d9d\r\n- **Build**: 20220824.8\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 25, 2022 2:09:00 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 24d6e0136b5656f80cd5d7e7c7fc9961cb583baf\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key.

As an example provided in that issue, this memory manager:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\nprivate sealed class BasicMemoryManager : MemoryManager<byte>\r\n{\r\n    private readonly byte[] _buffer;\r\n    public BasicMemoryManager(int size = 1024) => _buffer = new byte[size];\r\n\r\n    protected override bool TryGetArray(out ArraySegment<byte> segment)\r\n    {\r\n        segment = new ArraySegment<byte>(_buffer);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    public override Span<byte> GetSpan() => _buffer;\r\n\r\n    public override MemoryHandle Pin(int elementIndex = 0) => throw new NotSupportedException();\r\n    public override void Unpin() => throw new NotSupportedException();\r\n    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail two of the following tests:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n[Theory]\r\n[InlineData(0, 32)]\r\n[InlineData(0, 29)]\r\n[InlineData(32, 32)] // fail: length 0\r\n[InlineData(32, 29)] // fail: length -3\r\npublic void OffsetTest(int offset, int length)\r\n{\r\n    var mgr = new BasicMemoryManager(1024);\r\n    var slice = mgr.Memory.Slice(offset, length);\r\n    Assert.Equal(length, slice.Length);\r\n\r\n    var ros = new ReadOnlySequence<byte>(slice);\r\n    Assert.True(ros.IsSingleSegment);\r\n    Assert.Equal(length, ros.Length);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nFailing test has been added in this PR.\r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nLow, as the change is very simple and obvious when you look at `ReadOnlySequence<T>` ctor that accepts `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` (notice line 133 versus lines 140 and 148):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/0d40b482e6b6c232131dc808182d6b32d9d37394/src/System.Memory/src/System/Buffers/ReadOnlySequence.cs#L130-L149\r\n\r\nMoreover, the changed code gets triggered only when creating a `ReadOnlySequence` from a `ReadOnlyMemory` backed by a `MemoryManager`. All other use cases (including creating from an array or from a `ReadOnlyMemory` backed by an array or a string) are unaffected.

Needing to know if you were one of these has never been clear as to why that's important.  Roslyn operates in snapshots, and attempts to do so in a purely functional fashion.  What does it matter if you were on a .CurrentSolution, or a fork of that, or a fork of that fork?\r\n\r\nAt one point we definitely used this when it came to persisting data.  We didn't want analysis about a fork of a solution to overwrite data in our persistence service corresponding to the primary solution.  However, that code went away ages ago when:\r\n\r\n1. we stopped storing diagnostic information in the persistence layer.\r\n2. we ensured that all persisted data is stored with a checksum.\r\n\r\nAt that point, there was no concern about overwriting data with something invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR gets rid of hte BranchId concept entirely and fixes up any remaining stragglers to get off of it.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63578","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove BranchId from the workspace.\" (#63578)"},{"Id":"1349909212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-25T00:02:50","Actor":"jmarolf","Number":"63575","RawContent":null,"Title":"Send Document outline telemetry","State":"closed","Body":"default log level is debug and we only send telemetry if it is Info or higher","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63575","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Send Document outline telemetry\" (#63575)"},{"Id":"1349824857","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T23:29:07","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"63573","RawContent":null,"Title":"Do not offer ?. if the rhs will be a static member","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/63557","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63573","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Do not offer ?. if the rhs will be a static member\" (#63573)"},{"Id":"1350116704","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T23:12:49","Actor":"MattGal","Number":"63585","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move to -Svc pool provider in release branches","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63585","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Move to -Svc pool provider in release branches\" (#63585)"},{"Id":"1350114685","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T23:09:37","Actor":"MattGal","Number":"63584","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move to -Svc pool provider in release branches","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63584","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Move to -Svc pool provider in release branches\" (#63584)"},{"Id":"1349783142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T22:40:32","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"63572","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't offer 'use compound operator' if pp-directives are present","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/63552","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63572","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't offer 'use compound operator' if pp-directives are present\" (#63572)"},{"Id":"1350095478","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T22:37:13","Actor":"tmat","Number":"63583","RawContent":null,"Title":"SourceText created in didOpen LSP handler needs encoding and checksum algorithm","State":"open","Body":"In future we plan to update the workspace with the `SourceText` instances created by `didOpen` to avoid Solution snapshot duplication.

Method(string? param) => null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt feels like if you annotate that the behavior depends on the value of some input here, and you *never read that input*, something is wrong.\r\n\r\nIf we started to warn when such parameters are unread, we would catch the above case, and via the existing enforcement would continue to do the right thing in cases like the following:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n[return: NotNullIfNotNull(nameof(param))]\r\nstring? Method1(string? param)\r\n{\r\n    if (param == null) { return null; } // ok\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n[return: NotNullIfNotNull(nameof(param))]\r\nstring?

To handle these, we would have to make the investment of distinguishing *possibly null* from *definitely null*, which would be expensive. However, by catching the trivial scenario above I think we've added enough utility here to make the change worth making.\r\n```cs\r\n[return: NotNullIfNotNull(nameof(param))]\r\nstring?

Since use of multiple essentially has *or* semantics currently.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n[return: NotNullIfNotNull(nameof(param1)), NotNullIfNotNull(nameof(param2))]\r\nstring?

The issue is the using declaration can't tell when to close due to the goto. The same issue can be more simply created like this:\n\n```\npublic static void Test()\n{\n\tStringSplitOptions temp = StringSplitOptions.None;\n\tswitch (temp)\n\t{\n\t\tcase StringSplitOptions.None:\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\n\t\tcase StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries:\n\t\t\tusing var streamReader = new StreamReader(\"file1.txt\");\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n}\n```\nHowever, in this case, intellisense and the compiler can see and explain what is wrong:\n>error CS8647: A using variable cannot be used directly within a switch section (consider using braces).\n\nInterestingly, this can be fixed by simply wrapping the whole case in braces like this:\n\n```\npublic static void Test()\n{\n\tStringSplitOptions temp = StringSplitOptions.None;\n\tswitch (temp)\n\t{\n\t\tcase StringSplitOptions.None:\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\n\t\tcase StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries:\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tusing var streamReader = new StreamReader(\"file1.txt\");\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n}\n```\nHowever, the same trick doesn't work when the break is replaced with a goto statement, as evident from the first code snippet.\nSimilarly noteworthy, is that if the first code snippet is changed such that the using declaration is in the first case of the switch, it compiles:\n\n```\npublic static void Test()\n{\n\tStringSplitOptions temp = StringSplitOptions.None;\n\tswitch (temp)\n\t{\n\t\tcase StringSplitOptions.None:\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tusing var streamReader = new StreamReader(\"file1.txt\");\n\t\t\t\tgoto case StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\tcase StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries:\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWhether this should compile is somewhat beside the point as the real issue (for me at least) was the lack of information about what the issue was when it was occurring. Once I understood the problem, I could easily fix it.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 4/12/2022, 07:53 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Feedback Bot on 4/26/2022, 08:11 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/63570","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"using statement declaration within switch ending in goto results in \"csc.exe\" exited with code -2146232797\" (#63570)"},{"Id":"1349726083","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T16:26:10","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"63568","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disallow ModuleInitializer attribute on abstract/virtual static methods.","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #63481.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63568","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Disallow ModuleInitializer attribute on abstract/virtual static methods.\" (#63568)"},{"Id":"1349645991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T15:37:35","Actor":"jmarolf","Number":"63566","RawContent":null,"Title":"make roslyn solution default on unix","State":"open","Body":"I am opening this for discussion. @davidwengier had mentioned that he wanted building all of Roslyn.sln to be the default but I want @333fred and others from the compiler team to way in.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63566","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"make roslyn solution default on unix\" (#63566)"},{"Id":"1349606494","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T15:14:57","Actor":"TessenR","Number":"63565","RawContent":null,"Title":"Implicitly typed lambdas with `[UnscopedRef]` don't match their own anonymous delegate types","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: \r\n```\r\ncommit e041ae9802b68f7c6f6903ec92b56d27ff0caec3\r\nAuthor: Youssef Victor <youssefvictor00@gmail.com>\r\nDate:   Wed Aug 24 16:00:43 2022 +0200\r\n\r\n    Delete extra character in Syntax.xml (#63561)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n\r\nusing System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;\r\n\r\npublic ref struct RefStruct { }\r\npublic struct RegularStruct { }\r\n\r\ndelegate void D1([UnscopedRef] ref RefStruct s);\r\ndelegate void D2([UnscopedRef] out RegularStruct s);\r\n\r\npublic class C\r\n{\r\n  public void M()\r\n  {\r\n    var x = ([UnscopedRef] ref RefStruct s) => { }; // error CS8986: The 'scoped' modifier of parameter 's' doesn't match target '<anonymous delegate>'.\r\n    var y = ([UnscopedRef] out RegularStruct s) => { }; // error CS8986: The 'scoped' modifier of parameter 's' doesn't match target '<anonymous delegate>'.\r\n    D1 q = ([UnscopedRef] ref RefStruct s) => { };\r\n    D2 w = ([UnscopedRef] out RegularStruct s) => { };\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnamespace System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis\r\n{\r\n  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.All, Inherited = false)]\r\n  internal sealed class UnscopedRefAttribute : Attribute\r\n  {\r\n    public UnscopedRefAttribute()\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nNo errors for lambda expressions assigned to `var` variables.

If no C# project is loaded then default to the more modern .NET Core.\r\n\r\n## Background and Motivation\r\n.NET Framework 4 is now only receiving security and maintenance updates, having been superseded by the cross-platform .NET Core (now just \".NET\"). \r\n\r\nThe C# Interactive Window still loads in a .NET Framework 4 scripting environment by default, even if the currently loaded project is targeting .NET Core. In addition, the title bar for the window does not indicate which version of the environment has been loaded unless the user executes a `#reset [32|64|core]` command:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7127766/186436944-531ada2e-d097-47f2-84f6-71bec45ffb2a.png)\r\n(Which version has been loaded here? I am developing a .NET 6 application, but the Interactive Window is actually running .NET Framework 4.)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7127766/186438263-e4011434-15cb-474e-84f4-04b77eee2973.png)\r\n(After resetting to 64-bit .NET Framework environment the version info is present in the title bar.)\r\n\r\nThis is an obvious source of confusion for the user who naturally wants to explore language features or libraries related to the project they are currently working on.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nWhen the C# Interactive window is opened, Visual Studio should inspect the current project's target version for C# and automatically load in the relevant version. This would save the user having to use the `#reset [core|32|64]` command, which is not widely known.\r\n\r\nIf the current project does not target C#, the window should load the latest .NET Core environment, as this is most likely to be the one which the user will want to explore, given the current .NET landscape.\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n1. Provide the user the opportunity to choose a default for the Interactive Window when first using it. This would remove the need to interrogate the project properties. Alternatively, make this a preference and document it when opening the window each time.\r\n2. Highlight the `#reset [32|64|core]` command when opening the window each time, and indicate clearly what environment is being loaded instead of just printing \"Loading context from 'CSharpInteractive.rsp'.\" This small addition would make things more obvious to beginners and explain why modern .NET features are not available, even if the default cannot be changed for some reason.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\nFinally, provide the user with a drop-down list of the available scripting environments in the window's toolbar area, surfacing the switching functionality in a much more discoverable fashion when compared to learning the `#reset` command syntax.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/63563","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"C# Interactive Window should default to .NET Core if the current project targets it\" (#63563)"},{"Id":"1349373946","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T14:00:43","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"63561","RawContent":null,"Title":"Delete extra character in Syntax.xml","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/63561","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Delete extra character in Syntax.xml\" (#63561)"},{"Id":"1349393963","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T12:48:07","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"63562","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/dev17.0-vs-deps] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:059d41e3-5449-49d0-f30d-08d9a488296d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 059d41e3-5449-49d0-f30d-08d9a488296d\r\n- **Build**: 20220823.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 23, 2022 8:34:52 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 0db07252ccb18afdf94820ba6125da6de729ec04\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe [dotnet/announcements](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements) repo is intended to keep everyone informed about important information related to the .NET platform. It is a one-way broadcast that plays nicely with GitHub notifications, making it desirable to watch/subscribe to it.\r\n\r\nWe've come up with some best practice guidelines on how to use these announcements. Our approach to announcements enables some things to work well and requires a little extra care with others.\r\n\r\n## Design points\r\n\r\nAs a broad description, think of dotnet/announcements as an aggregated mirror of important issues and GitHub notifications as an RSS feed for it. The issues in this repo are NOT the canonical copy, but a mirror.\r\n\r\nThe key design points of dotnet/announcements:\r\n\r\n- Issues-only repo.\r\n- Only a few people can create issues.\r\n- Issues are mirrored copies of issues from other repos.\r\n- Issues are locked immediately.\r\n\r\nThese design points significantly reduce the scale of notifications from this repo, resulting in high signal to noise. It also avoid two sets of uncoordinated discussions. Discussions only occur on the canonical issue.\r\n\r\nNote: We (ab)use \"temporary interaction limits\" so that only a few people can post to the repo. It would be ideal if this model (one-way broadcast) was better supported and we could just pin arbitrary org issues to an read-only announcements repo. \r\n\r\n## Best practices\r\n\r\nThe following best practices are intended to result in best overall community experience.\r\n\r\n### Don't link to dotnet/announcements from GitHub\r\n\r\nGitHub includes [references to other issues or PRs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7038#ref-issue-1224354673) that link to an issue or PR as part of the comment/activity history. It's an excellent feature that helps us understand who else cares about a given topic. We actively rely on it and sometimes [reach out to other projects to help them](https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/3276#issuecomment-1118911927).\r\n\r\nThis feature doesn't work with locked issues (which makes sense). Please do not link -- from GitHub -- to the locked mirror issue on dotnet/announcements, but to the unlocked canonical issue. Your reference will be blocked by the lock. That's counter-productive.\r\n\r\nYou can see this dynamic playing out in the following matching/pair issues. The canonical issue has all the messy (and useful) activity and the locked dotnet/announcement issue is a clean replica.\r\n\r\n- [Canonical issue](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428)\r\n- [dotnet/announcements mirror issue](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218)\r\n\r\nYou'll see the same pattern with other [dotnet/announcement issues](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues).\r\n\r\n### Prefer linking to dotnet/announcements from the web\r\n\r\nThere is value in linking to dotnet/announcements from blogs and other sites (like StackOverflow, just not GitHub). The value is that more people might discover dotnet/announcements, subscribe to it, and be better informed about .NET platform news.\r\n\r\nFrom dotnet/announcements, users can quickly jump to a canonical issue should they want to. However, if you want to link directly to canonical issues, that's A-OK.\r\n\r\n### Create your own queries\r\n\r\nIt is easy to create your own queries of dotnet/announcement issues. The easiest way to do that is via [labels](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels).\r\n\r\nHere are some good ones:\r\n\r\n- [Docker](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Docker)\r\n- [Monthly-Update](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Monthly-Update)\r\n- [Breaking%20Change](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Breaking%20Change)\r\n\r\nLooks like we messed up when we created the breaking change label. Team, let's try to avoid labels with spaces in future. We could change it, but ...\r\n\r\nYou can also create slightly more complex queries:\r\n\r\n- [.NET 6.0 + Security](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASecurity+label%3A%22.NET+6.0%22)\r\n- [.NET 6.0 + Monthly Update](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMonthly-Update+label%3A%22.NET+6.0%22+)\r\n\r\nNote: This best practice creates query links to dotnet/announcements, which can be seen as violating the previous practice. The query links unavoidably target dotnet/announcements.\r\n\r\n### Subscribe to notifications\r\n\r\nSubscribe to notifications will help keep you up to date with .NET Platform news. To subscribe, click the \"Watch\" button.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"614\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/175190716-572b42db-494e-44c9-9a74-add258c234fa.png\">\r\n\r\nYou will want to select \"All Activity\".\r\n\r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/175190922-19c15684-17e1-462c-9fc9-48cfd14cdfef.png\">\r\n\r\n## Bests practices for Microsoft folks\r\n\r\nMicrosoft folks should follow these practices when posting issues to dotnet/announcements\r\n\r\n### Direct reader to the canonical issue\r\n\r\nDirect readers to the canonical issue as an immediate call out, with following pattern:\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7556. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/223\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/227\r\n\r\nThe canonical issue should not link to the dotnet/announcements mirror issue.\r\n\r\n### Consider creating the canonical issue as a discussion\r\n\r\nThe GitHub discussion feature is very good. For issues that are sure to spark feedback and/or benefit from more discussion, you should use a discussion issue.\r\n\r\nGood discussion example: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/discussions/71042\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/229","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet/announcements best practices\" (#229)"},{"Id":"1287906136","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T21:30:32","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"228","RawContent":null,"Title":"`System.Drawing.Common` will only be supported on Windows","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n***Note:** This is a re-post of a design point we already discussed and shipped in .NET 6. I'm posting this here because (1) some people have tried to find it here and (2) some folks have never heard of it.*\r\n\r\nMoving forward, `System.Drawing.Windows` will only be supported on Windows. The library is marked as Windows-only (which results in build warnings when used from cross-platform code) and will throw by default when used from a non-Windows OS. For the time being, there is a runtime switch that enables users to still carry and use their own copy of `libgdiplus`. We intend to remove this functionality eventually as well.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nIn the .NET Core 2.x days we created the `Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility` package which exposes many Windows-only APIs so that more people can migrate to .NET Core. As part of this, we also ported `System.Drawing.Common`. This was mainly meant for .NET Core users that still target Windows, however since Mono already had a cross-platform implementation, we decided to bring that over. The cross-platform functionality is provided via the native library `libgdiplus`. Sadly, `libgdiplus` is a community supported library and at this point effectively unmaintained.\r\n\r\nWhile `libgdiplus` has helped a lot of customers expand to cross-platform it has also caused some headaches. `System.Drawing.Common` is very Windows driven as it is mostly a wrapper around GDI+ and is heavily coupled to Windows Forms, which keeps evolving and diverging from cross-platform graphics. This has caused some confusion over why some things don't work well on Unix or don't work at all.\r\n\r\nThe cross-platform implementation of `System.Drawing.Common` is mainly provided on the native side, via `libgdiplus`. It's effectively a re-implementation of the parts of Windows that `System.Drawing.Common` is depending on. As you can imagine, that makes `libgdiplus` a very non-trivial component. It's around 30k lines of pretty old C code, virtually untested, and lacks a lot of functionality. `libgdiplus` also has a lot of external dependencies for all the image processing and text rendering, such as `cairo`, `pango`, and other native libraries, which makes maintaining and shipping it even more challenging.\r\n\r\nSince `System.Drawing.Common` was really designed to be a thin wrapper over Windows technologies, its cross-platform implementation is a bit like a square peg in a round hole; it's subpar because it was only designed with Windows in mind.\r\n\r\nSince the inclusion of the Mono cross-platform implementation we spent lot of time redirecting issues to `libgdiplus` that never got fixed, or helping people install `libgdiplus` correctly (because it's not part of .NET Core proper). This is very different from other external dependencies we have taken, for example, `icu` or `openssl`, which are high-quality libraries, rather than poorly maintained re-implementation of Windows components. Thus, we have come to believe that it's not viable to get `libgdiplus` to the point where its feature set and quality is on par with the rest of the .NET stack.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed (such as from analysis of NuGet packages) that `System.Drawing.Common` is used on cross-platform mostly for image manipulation like QR code generators and text rendering. We haven't noticed heavy graphics usage as our cross-platform graphics support is very incomplete. For example, right now some components crash on macOS because the native APIs we use have been deprecated and are no longer included with recent macOS releases. We have never gotten a report about that crash; we discovered it ourselves while making `System.Drawing.Common` trim compatible.\r\n\r\nThe usages we see of `System.Drawing.Common` in non-Windows environments are typically well supported with `SkiaSharp` and `ImageSharp`.\r\n\r\nThus, we believe it is not worth investing in making `System.Drawing.Common` work on non-Windows platforms and instead propose we only keep evolving it in the context of Windows Forms and GDI+.\r\n\r\n## Design Approach\r\n\r\nFor more details on the design approach, see [this design document](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234/files?short_path=5a79205#diff-5a79205cd271d8ec2d3c5d74112f6874998e1e1aa7ee00900db727eef25561d8).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/228","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`System.Drawing.Common` will only be supported on Windows\" (#228)"},{"Id":"1284382326","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T00:31:43","Actor":"richlander","Number":"227","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 ","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/71231. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 \r\n \r\nThe [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist) package has historically allowed us to fast-track EventSource API bug fixes out-of-band for .NET Framework 4.x. In recent years we continued to ship versions of this package concurrently with .NET Core releases, but the last time it was used to intentionally distribute out-of-band fixes for .NET Framework was package version 1.1.28 from 2015. The fixes that originally made the package useful have long since been applied to the .NET Framework in-box EventSource API and now we plan to phase out this package. Support for the current 6.0 version of the package will continue for as long as .NET 6.0 is supported but no future versions concurrent with .NET 7 and beyond are planned.\r\n \r\nWe recommend developers targeting .NET Framework 4.x use the in-box version of the EventSource API, System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource. Developers who want to track future feature development in the EventSource API should target System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource included in the latest available release of .NET runtime, currently .NET 6.\r\n \r\n## Details\r\n \r\n### How to migrate away from Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist\r\n \r\n1. For apps and libraries targeting .NET Framework ensure you are targeting at least version 4.6.2. For apps and libraries targeting\r\n .NET Standard, .NET Core, or .NET 5+ no targeting change is needed.\r\n \r\n2. Replace references in source to the namespace `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing`\r\n with `System.Diagnostics.Tracing` instead. For example\r\n \r\n```\r\nusing Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing;\r\n```\r\nshould now be\r\n```\r\nusing System.Diagnostics.Tracing;\r\n```\r\n \r\n3. Remove package references to Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracking.EventSource.Redist from project files. You can do this in Visual Studio UI by selecting References->Manage NuGet packages... , then selecting the package from the installed package list and click the uninstall button. Alternately you can use the [Uninstall command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-uninstall-package) in Visual Studio package manager. For apps developed using the .NET CLI tools you can use the [dotnet remove package command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-remove-package).\r\n \r\n### What happens if I do nothing?\r\n \r\nThe Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package should continue to work as-is, but support for the [latest major version of the package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist/6.0.0) will end November 12, 2024. After that point the package will receive no further fixes for security or any other reason. There are no known security vulnerabilities in this package but it is always possible new issues will be discovered in the future.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/227","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 \" (#227)"},{"Id":"1277625586","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T01:45:44","Actor":"richlander","Number":"226","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET support for Windows 7 and 8.1 will end in January 2023","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7556.

These packages will be maintained by the .NET team and kept up to date as part of each servicing release for each of the supported .NET versions.\r\n\r\nThese are the package identifiers of the new set of packages to be added:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.Preview\r\n\r\n## Implementation Timeline\r\n\r\n1. Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking Change to .NET Packages on Winget\" (#218)"},{"Id":"1224334047","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T16:38:05","Actor":"leecow","Number":"217","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Package Maintenance\r\n\r\n.NET Core was released in June 2016, and over the last six years, many thousands of NuGet packages have been published under the .NET umbrella. Many of these packages are legacy or out-of-support already. As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered. Please see the [.NET Package Deprecation list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/net-package-deprecation.md) and use issue https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7420 to comment.\r\n\r\n## 22-June Update\r\n\r\nWe have started the 'get-clean' process beginning with DNX packages and will proceed cautiously through the older, out-of-support releases. If you believe this package is deprecated by mistake please file a new [Package Deprecation](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdotnet%2Fcore%2Fissues%2Fnew%3Fassignees%3D%26labels%3Dpackage-deprecation%26template%3D03_package_deprecation.yaml%26title%3D%255BPackageId%255D%253A%2B%255Bversion%2528s%2529%255D&data=05%7C01%7Cleecow%40microsoft.com%7C717f6f8141854cb2a90e08da52fe38d9%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637913549082767132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=jOKETWh%2FPS0YI4wFPL8ErBuGJhawlOCnkqt1QVRaty4%3D&reserved=0) Issue and share your reasoning.

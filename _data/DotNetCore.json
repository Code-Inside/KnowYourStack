This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present.

It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28073","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[.NET Core 3.1] Don't rely on the built-in interface marshaller during COM activation.\" (#28073)"},{"Id":"670175635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T23:15:55","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

When a thread is created coreclr requests for the processor affinity of the new thread to be changed to the process' affinity, which is not allowed under Snap's strict confinement.\r\n- There are a couple of workarounds, but both involve manual/non-default steps (inconvenient) and give the process more control than desired:\r\n  - Specify the process-control plug and manually connect it before running the app\r\n  - Require the classic confinement instead and specify it when installing the app\r\n- The workarounds may also cause some difficulty, especially longer-term, for .NET Core apps to be added to the public snap store due to the extra control the process would require.\r\n  - It is possible to specify to auto-connect the process-control plug using store processes, but it requires review and justification, and the purpose of working around this issue may be difficult to justify longer-term\r\n  - Apps that use the classic confinement run without any sandboxing, and may not be allowed in the public snap store for the purpose of working around this issue\r\n  - See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1634#issuecomment-667332468 for more information\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested a small app under Snap's strict confinement\r\n- PAL, coreclr, and libraries tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- Instead of the creating thread changing the affinity of the created thread, the created thread changes its own affinity after starting, the difference is mostly invisible\r\n- Where appropriate, used a fallback to use the pthread implementation for setting the affinity when sched_setaffinity is not available, so in the theoretical possibility of a different pthread implementation for setting the affinity, there would be no change from before","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28071","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Change new thread's affinity after thread starts, from the same thread, as a workaround for Snap\" (#28071)"},{"Id":"668934448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-30T17:04:31","Actor":"silvioguiso","Number":"28069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Decodes bitstream to string","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Decodes bitstream to string\" (#28069)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CLI-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"702390737","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T02:07:19","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"13561","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1.4xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/sdk","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n- **Subscription**: 74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae\r\n- **Build**: 20200915.25\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/16/2020 1:56 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 7c8ec1ed801d80116a87da8f6f874f0cc3f4b18e\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1.4xx\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

If no, what is the benefit of the new feature?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1748","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Is it legal to decompile .NET libraries?\" (#1748)"},{"Id":"595131445","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T13:46:58","Actor":"Nekuskus","Number":"1754","RawContent":null,"Title":"System.TypeInitializationException","State":"open","Body":"I keep getting `System.TypeInitializationException: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Can't find file or assembly 'System.Private.CoreLib, Version=4.0.0.0', Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e` exception after moving my app from .NET Core to .NET Framework 4.7.2.

There is no workaround and if running long enough, .NET will consume all available memory and crash. The `SecTrustRef` is internal structure and holds additional objects - like URL of OCSP or CRL responder so leaked memory is bigger than small. \r\n\r\n## Customer  Impact \r\nWe have worked with a major customer who has been hitting this leak in an app that they intend to widely deploy within their organization (10K”s of deployments).

Section headers based on globbing or relative file paths are ignored.\r\n\r\n- File/directory _agnostic_ configuration:\r\n  - No implicit discovery: Need to be explicitly specified in the MSBuild targets/project file to be passed to the compiler:\r\n     ```xml\r\n     <ItemGroup>\r\n       <EditorConfgFiles Include=\"<%path_to_global_analyzer_config%>\" />\r\n     </ItemGroup>\r\n     ```\r\n   - No globbing or relative file path based section headers allowed: All supported analyzer configuration entries must either be _top level without section header_ OR _section header must have an absolute file path_. Entries under any section headers that are based on globs, say `[*.cs]` or `[*]`, or section headers that use relative file paths are ignored.\r\n\r\n- Core scenarios: Support identical analyzer configuration entries as editorconfig files, but for different core scenarios:\r\n   - Allow NuGet packages and SDKs to ship compilation level analyzer configuration files that apply to all source files in the project, regardless of the actual file names or file paths of these source files.\r\n   - Allow passing in project-level MSBuild property values and item metadata to analyzers and source generators: Details [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/source-generators.cookbook.md#consume-msbuild-properties-and-metadata)\r\n   - Allow configuration of no-location analyzer diagnostics that do not have a file path and hence cannot be configured via regular editorconfig files.\r\n\r\n- Conflict resolution:\r\n   - Entries with same key coming from different global analyzerconfig files are ignored and compiler generates warnings about each of these conflicts.\r\n   - Lowest precedence for option configuration entries: For entries with same key coming from a global analyzerconfig and editorconfig file, the editorconfig file entry always overrides the global analyzerconfig entry\r\n   - Lowest precedence for diagnostic severity configuration entries: Diagnostic severity settings that come from editorconfig files and those that come from command line options (`/nowarn`, `/warnaserror`) always override the entries from global analyzerconfig files.\r\n\r\n- Example: \r\n\r\n```ini\r\n# Top level entry required to mark this as a global analyzer config file\r\nis_global = true\r\n\r\n# NOTE: No section headers for configuration entries\r\n\r\n#### .NET Coding Conventions ####\r\n\r\n# this. and Me. preferences\r\ndotnet_style_qualification_for_method = true:warning\r\n\r\n#### Diagnostic configuration ####\r\n\r\n# CA1000: Do not declare static members on generic types\r\ndotnet_diagnostic.CA1000.severity = warning\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Confusion points\r\n\r\nThe core points of confusion are:\r\n\r\n- Both file kinds have a similar end user goal of configuring analyzers and/or source generators, even though they have completely orthogonal purposes - path based vs path agnostic configuration for source files in the compilation.\r\n- Both files have similar format for the core configuration entries: key-value pair based entries, including support for the well-known diagnostic severity configuration entries\r\n- Use of same compiler switch for both files + Use of the editorconfig terminology in the MSBuild item name to specify global analyzerconfig files, i.e. `<EditorConfgFiles Include=\"path_to_global_analyzer_config\"/>`. This was done to reduce the engineering cost on project system side, especially legacy project system. However, this makes the user feel the file name and format must match regular .editorconfig files, including use of globbing based section headers. For example, classic user mistake highlighted in the issue [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/43080#issuecomment-688816162). \r\n- Global analyzer config files can be named `.editorconfig` and things work just fine as long as entries abide by the global analyzerconfig's required format.\r\n- Global analyzer config files silently ignore analyzer configuration entries under section headers\r\n- Lack of tooling support in VS to create/edit global config files, so user has to manually do all the steps, making it hard to reason about the subtle differences between the two file formats.\r\n\r\n# Action items for future work\r\n\r\nThere are few action items that we plan to take up to reduce the above confusion:\r\n- [ ] [**@mavasani**] Documentation: Add official documentation on docs.microsoft.com on global analyzerconfig files and add a FAQ section for the differences between regular editorconfig files and global analyzerconfig files.\r\n- [ ] [**@chsienki**] Better compiler warnings in global analyzerconfig files:\r\n   - Generate a compiler warning for use of editorconfig style globbing based or relative file path based section headers, instead of silently ignoring these.\r\n   - Consider generating a compiler warning for global analyzerconfig files that are name \".editorconfig\", recommending user to choose a different file name for clarity. This likely indicates user is confusing both these file kinds to be the same format, and might be heading towards shooting themselves in the foot.\r\n- [ ]  [**@chsienki**] Potential MSBuild item name change: Consider using a different MSBuild item name for specifying global analyzer config files. Instead of recommending users to include `<EditorConfgFiles Include=\"<%path_to_global_analyzer_config%>\" />`, we should consider introducing a new item name, say `<GlobalAnalyzerConfgFiles Include=\"<%path_to_global_analyzer_config%>\" />`. Under the covers, compiler MSBuild targets will just append both editorconfig files and global analyzerconfig files to a single list of config files passed to the compiler. However, this will likely reduce the chances of user getting confused into thinking these are regular editorconfig files.\r\n- [ ] [**@chsienki**] Bug fix: We should update the GeneratedCodeUtilities heuristic to consider source files without a file path as generated files, currently they are considered as non-generated files: http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/InternalUtilities/GeneratedCodeUtilities.cs,63","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47707","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Editorconfig vs Global analyzerconfig\" (#47707)"},{"Id":"701948176","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-15T13:50:23","Actor":"svick","Number":"47706","RawContent":null,"Title":"FindNode can't find OmittedArraySizeExpressionSyntax","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: 3.7.0\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\nRun the following code:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar type = SyntaxFactory.ParseTypeName(\"int[]\");\r\n\r\nvar omittedExpression = type.DescendantNodes().OfType<OmittedArraySizeExpressionSyntax>().Single();\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(type.FindNode(omittedExpression.FullSpan, getInnermostNodeForTie: true).Kind());\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**: The code prints `OmittedArraySizeExpression`.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**: The code prints `ArrayRankSpecifier`.\r\n\r\nPresumably, the issue is that the width of the `OmittedArraySizeExpression` node is zero, i.e. its `FullSpan` is `[4..4)`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47706","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FindNode can't find OmittedArraySizeExpressionSyntax\" (#47706)"},{"Id":"702346326","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-22T11:39:05","Actor":"dimkadv2","Number":"47730","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to block terminate application","State":"open","Body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nI need to block terminate app (windows service),\r\n\r\ni try using next code:\r\n\r\n```c#        \r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostApplicationLifetime appLifetime)\r\n{\r\n    appLifetime.ApplicationStopping.Register(async () => await OnStopping(app));\r\n    .....\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate async Task OnStopping(IApplicationBuilder app)\r\n{\r\n    var processingService = app.ApplicationServices.GetRequiredService<ProcessingEventBus>();\r\n    while (processingService.ExistTasks())\r\n    {\r\n           await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut all object inherited from IDisposable called Dispose method.\r\n\r\nHow do I defer standard completion until the method processingService.ExistTasks() return false?\r\n\r\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47730","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to block terminate application\" (#47730)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CoreRT-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"702278186","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-15T21:13:48","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8335","RawContent":null,"Title":"ARM64: FlushProcessWriteBuffers","State":"open","Body":"-Redirect FlushProcessWriteBuffers from Unix Pal to the Unix GC Env.

The question here is only if the conversion should be done on the C# or C side?\r\n\r\nThe handle might be more tricky as pthread_t doesn't need to be a numeric type. \r\n\r\nTherefore my idea is to store the handle in the managed part a a intptr. For systems that uses a numeric type for pthread_t that is smaller than a pointer we can just use it direct. On other systems we need to allocate some memory to store a copy of pthread_t and the managed part will store a pointer to this memory. But we need to make sure the memory is freed when the managed thread object is collected. \r\n\r\nThe other option would be doing it in the same way as socket addresses are store. The managed part asks the native how much space is needed. It creates a byte array and every time a native call is made the array is pinned. While this is very straight forward it might be less efficent.

The easiest thing I could think of was this:\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net5.0-windows</TargetFramework>\r\n    <UseWindowsForms>True</UseWindowsForms>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis compiles and runs, but the process isn't connected to the current console host, which causes no output to appear in the shell from which the console app was launched. I assume that's because the produced .exe uses the wrong subsystem.\r\n\r\nI was able to work this around by not using `UseWindowsForms` and instead referencing the desktop framework:\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net5.0-windows</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that `UseWindowsForms` somehow overwrites the `OutputType` property.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

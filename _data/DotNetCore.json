It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Roslyn should then _actually_ exit. However, looking at the implementation of the handler for the exit notification, I cannot find anything related to actually exiting the server.\n\nAs a test, I added this:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/LanguageServer/Protocol/Handler/ServerLifetime/LspServiceLifeCycleManager.cs b/src/LanguageServer/Protocol/Handler/ServerLifetime/LspServiceLifeCycleManager.cs\nindex 0c224504a53..a7f25770d29 100644\n--- a/src/LanguageServer/Protocol/Handler/ServerLifetime/LspServiceLifeCycleManager.cs\n+++ b/src/LanguageServer/Protocol/Handler/ServerLifetime/LspServiceLifeCycleManager.cs\n@@ -68,7 +68,9 @@ public async Task ShutdownAsync(string message = \"Shutting down\")\n         }\n     }\n \n-    public async Task ExitAsync()\n+    public Task ExitAsync()\n     {\n+        Environment.Exit(0);\n+        return Task.CompletedTask;\n     }\n }\n```\n\nand now it works exactly as expected for me.\n\nI am not sure if the above snippet will cause any issues with for example the test suite, but I do believe this is an issue where the LSP specification is not followed as it should, and it requires a change here.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/82069","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"LSP: actually `exit` server in exit handler\" (#82069)"},{"Id":"3826563370","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-18T09:54:16","Actor":"glen-84","Number":"82068","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix grammar errors in incremental-generators.md","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/82068","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix grammar errors in incremental-generators.md\" (#82068)"},{"Id":"3826473252","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-18T07:47:04","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"82067","RawContent":null,"Title":"Not for review","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/82067","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Not for review\" (#82067)"},{"Id":"3826080368","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-18T00:09:00","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"82066","RawContent":null,"Title":"Using a JsonSchemaSegment with a json comment breaks visual studio auto complete and syntax highliting","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Using-a-JsonSchemaSegment-with-a-json-co/11026128)._\n\n---\n[severity:Other]\n**Description:**\nThere is a feature where you can append the schema for json files using the MSBuild attribute `JsonSchemaSegment`. You can include this schema within a NuGet package to help provide validation for users editing their appsettings. However if that schema is invalid, in any form it will break the inteilises and auto complete of the last two versions of visual studio. A simple way to break it is to add a comment in the json schema.\n\nThere is no errors, anywhere. Deleting bin, obj, .vs, visual studios internal cache still does not resolve the issue. I even looked in Structured Log Viewer to find any, not a single hint. This lead to me wasting wayyyy to much time trying to figure out why it was broken. \n\nI have attached a demo project which will recreate the issue. Just build the `Poisioned.Package` and then build the `Source Project`. You will need to close visual studio and reopen. At that point you will notice syntax highlting will be gone on all nuget packages, in this case Newtonsoft.Json\n\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=B0aba22830b1c48df9733d4be3298d586639035253218852230_20260108-221521-image.png&tid=0aba22830b1c48df9733d4be3298d586639035253218852230)\n\n**Effects:**\n* Visual Studio 2022\n* Visual Studio 2026\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 1/9/2026, 06:08 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We recently reviewed pull usage for .NET Framework 3.5 images (across all Windows Server versions) and found that it is low. We plan to stop producing (and no longer document) the `3.5` tag for Server 2025 before it gets significant usage. We only [recently added support for Windows Server 2025](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/pull/1183). We will not be publishing .NET Framework 3.5 images for Windows Server 2025+ going forward.\n\nWe plan to stop producing .NET Framework 3.5 tags for Windows Server 2025 on May 13th.\n\nWindows Server 2025 tags for .NET Framework 3.5 look like the following:\n\n```\n3.5-20250211-windowsservercore-ltsc2025, 3.5-windowsservercore-ltsc2025, 3.5\n```\n\nDocumentation for installing .NET Framework 3.5 is provided here: [How to install .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows Server Core container images](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/blob/main/documentation/install-netfx3.md).\n\nWe are currently considering opportunities to consolidate 4.x images.

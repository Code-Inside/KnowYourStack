The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

For example, if a generator needs to produce a type for JSON serialization, the output of the first generator needs to be treated as input to another generator (JSON source generation). The same is true for other generators, like LibraryImport.\n\n## Proposal\n\nUse attributes as an interchange mechanism. The majority of well-behaved generators are attribute-based incremental generators. This means that they are triggered exclusively by the presence of specific attributes in the source code.\n\nThis also means that there's an implicit API contract that Roslyn can take advantage of. By scanning the output of all generators using FAWMN, Roslyn can run generators if and only if source code is generated that matches a FAWMN-tagged generator. This should be a relatively cheap operation (syntax-only) for Roslyn to perform.\n\nTo support this pattern, generators would have to publish a list of the trigger attributes, much like they publish a set of diagnostics. If they do so, Roslyn will perform the following task:\n\n1. Load and run generators like now.\n2. For every generated file, scan using FAWMN logic and all registered attribute names.\n3. If any attributes are found in the generated files, re-run the registered generator with precisely those files, plus the original compilation.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no more attributes are produced.\n5. Compile and emit with all source files, like today.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/82271","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: FAWMN generator chaining\" (#82271)"},{"Id":"3892478797","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-03T17:58:06","Actor":"akhera99","Number":"82268","RawContent":null,"Title":"Skip CodeGenClosureLambdaTests.InvalidGotoLiftingBetweenGotoAndLabel4","State":"open","Body":"Tracking issue while skipping due to flaky behavior.

Update all `*.cs` files under `src/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers/` that currently have missing/incorrect headers (e.g., old Microsoft copyright header) to the required .NET Foundation header.\r\n>    - Preserve any existing UTF-8 BOM if present.\r\n>    - Preserve any `#nullable`, `#if`, or other preprocessor directives—only adjust the leading header comment block.\r\n>    - Do not change code logic/formatting beyond the header block.\r\n>    - If a file is clearly imported/third-party and intentionally uses a different license header, do NOT change it; instead, keep it excluded or add a narrower exclusion with justification (but prefer updating headers if these are now SDK-owned).\r\n> 2. Remove the IDE0073 exclusion for NetAnalyzers from the repository root `.editorconfig`:\r\n>    - Delete the section:\r\n>      - `[src/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers/**.cs]`\r\n>      - `dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0073.severity = none`\r\n> 3. Ensure IDE0073 enforcement applies and the directory is clean:\r\n>    - Run/validate formatting or build steps as appropriate to ensure no IDE0073 warnings remain for files in this directory.\r\n> \r\n> ## Constraints / Notes\r\n> - This will be a large mechanical change across many files; keep commits focused and avoid unrelated edits.\r\n> - Ensure `.editorconfig` still enforces the header template repo-wide.\r\n> - Update only C# files as part of IDE0073 scope described above.\r\n> \r\n> ## Deliverable\r\n> Open a pull request against `dotnet/sdk` targeting `main` with these changes and a clear description referencing issue #52775.\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\r\n\r\n*This pull request was created from Copilot chat.*\r\n>\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\r\n---\r\n\r\n💬 We'd love your input!

No logs are displayed in the terminal.\n> \n> However, when I separate the arguments using `--`, the output works correctly.\n> \n> ### Reproduction Steps\n> 1. Create a new console or web application (`dotnet new web`).\n> 2. Run the application using: `dotnet watch run --no-hot-reload`.\n> 3. Observe the terminal output.\n> \n> ### Expected Behavior\n> The application logs (e.g., `Now listening on: https://localhost...`) should be visible in the terminal, just like they are with standard `dotnet run`.\n> \n> ### Actual Behavior\n> The application starts (verified by accessing localhost), but the terminal remains blank. No output is forwarded to the console.\n> \n> ### Known Workaround\n> None\n> \n> ### Correction regarding workaround\n> I previously thought that `dotnet watch -- run --no-hot-reload` was a workaround.\n> However, closer inspection reveals that while this restores `stdout`, it **fails to disable Hot Reload** (the watcher ignores the flag behind the separator and prints `🔥 Hot reload enabled`).\n> \n> Therefore, currently, there seems to be **no way** to run `dotnet watch` with Hot Reload disabled AND keep the console output visible.\n> \n> ### Environment\n> - **IDE:** Visual Studio 2026 (Preview)\n> - **OS:** Windows 11\n> - **.NET SDK:** 10.0.100\n> \n> ### Additional context\n> It seems like `dotnet watch` is consuming the stdout stream or failing to pipe it correctly when the `--no-hot-reload` flag is parsed directly by the watcher without the separator.</issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n- Fixes dotnet/sdk#51856\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Then, if a user deletes the `sdk-manifests` folder manually to try to fix this, this isn't sufficient to reset workloads to a clean state—somewhere on disk, the SDK still thinks workloads are installed. Users currently have no reliable way to get back to a \"blank slate\" for workloads.\n> \n> ## Problem\n> \n> `dotnet workload clean --all` does not remove all workload-related components:\n> - Workload sets may remain on disk\n> - Other artifacts that track installed workload state persist\n> - Users can get stuck in states where workloads appear installed but are broken\n> \n> ## Proposed Solution\n> \n> Enhance `dotnet workload clean --all` to:\n> 1. Remove workload sets\n> 2. Remove all manifest-related files\n> 3. Clear any other persisted state that tracks installed workloads\n> 4. Effectively restore the SDK to a state as if no workloads were ever installed\n> \n> This would give users a reliable escape hatch when workloads get into a bad state, rather than requiring manual hunting for files across the disk.\n> \n> ## Additional Context\n> \n> - Related PR: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52434 (workload repair for missing manifests)\n> - The `--all` flag already implies a more aggressive cleanup, so this enhancement aligns with user expectations\n> </issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>dotnet workload clean was created before workload sets.

Since both reference the same SDK file path, they have identical Identity values, causing a duplicate key error.\n\n## Fix\n\nFollowing the established pattern used by JSModules, ScopedCss, and ServiceWorker targets:\n\n1. **Copy to intermediate folder**: The HotReload JS module is copied to `$(IntermediateOutputPath)hotreload\\` before being defined as a StaticWebAsset\n2. **Unique Identity**: Each project now has a unique Identity for the asset (pointing to their own intermediate folder)\n3. **No filter changes needed**: The copy-to-intermediate pattern naturally avoids duplicates without modifying filter logic\n\nThis follows @javiercn's guidance: \"What we do in other situations with assets like this is to copy them to the intermediate output folder before defining them.\"\n\n## Testing\n\nThe `Publish_HostingMultipleBlazorWebApps_Works` test now passes.\n\ncc @javiercn @maraf","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52816","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix hotreload duplicate assets\" (#52816)"},{"Id":"3893128820","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-02-03T20:42:58","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"52815","RawContent":null,"Title":"Investigate consolidating ReplaceFilesWithSymbolicLinks into DeduplicateAssembliesWithLinks","State":"open","Body":"  ### Background                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n  We now have two tasks that deduplicate files in the SDK layout by creating symbolic links:                                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n  | | **ReplaceFilesWithSymbolicLinks** | **DeduplicateAssembliesWithLinks** |                                                                                             \n  |---|---|---|                                                                                                                                                            \n  | **Input** | Two directories: `Directory` and `LinkToFilesFrom` | Single directory: `LayoutDirectory` |                                                                 \n  | **Matching** | By **filename** (then verifies content) | By **content hash** (filenames can differ) |                                                                  \n  | **Scope** | Links files from one known location to another | Finds duplicates anywhere in the tree |                                                                   \n  | **Platform** | Unix only | Cross-platform |                                                                                                                            \n  | **Link type** | Symlinks only | Hard links or symlinks |                                                                                                               \n  | **File types** | All files | Assemblies only (.dll/.exe) |                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n  `ReplaceFilesWithSymbolicLinks` is used specifically to link runtime pack files to shared framework files, while `DeduplicateAssembliesWithLinks` is a general-purpose   \n  deduplication task.                                                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n  ### Proposal                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n  Investigate whether `ReplaceFilesWithSymbolicLinks` can be removed in favor of `DeduplicateAssembliesWithLinks`, which would:                                            \n  -

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.

Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.

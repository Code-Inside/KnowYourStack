That release [coincided with .NET Core 3.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/#introducing-the-new-sqlclient). We‚Äôve been developing [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) in the [dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient) repo since that time, over the last five years. It‚Äôs now time to start the deprecation process for the [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) package. We plan to take a staged process to deprecation, with the intent to align support changes and associated code transition activities between these libraries to natural migration points between .NET major versions.\r\n\r\nAll System.Data.SqlClient users are encouraged to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. We offer improvements and significantly higher support via the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nWe intend to deprecate the System.Data.SqlClient package in stages.\r\n- **Before .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - Publish a new 5.0.0 package, including the following changes.\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 7 and earlier and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and earlier.\r\n  - Publish assets for the following target frameworks: .NET 8, .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n  - Add [Obsolete attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#obsolete-attribute) to .NET 8 and .NET Standard 2.0 assets. This will generate new warnings for .NET 8+ and .NET Standard users.\r\n  - Continue to offer security servicing, for .NET 8, and .NET Framework 4.6.2+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - No change\r\n  - We will not support this package for .NET 9+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 8 EOL:**\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 8 users (the .NET 8 library will be removed).\r\n  - Maintain support for .NET Framework 4.6.2+ users.\r\n  - Security servicing will be provided via .NET Framework, not the package, at that point.\r\n  - We do not expect to update the package again after this point.\r\n  - We will not mark the package as deprecated since it will only support .NET Framework users with an implementation provided by .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nWe will remove support in the package for unsupported .NET and .NET Framework versions at various stages of this deprecation plan. Users affected by those changes are encouraged to move to a supported .NET or .NET Framework version and to adopt the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove support for .NET 6 since it will go EOL shortly after this new package is released, even though .NET 6 will still be supported at the time. Publishing a .NET 8 library significantly simplifies the plan, both in terms of what we will deliver and what we need to explain.\r\n\r\nFor .NET dates, see [.NET Releases.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) .NET 9 will [GA in November](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) of this year. .NET 8 will go EOL in November, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe current package version of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) is 4.8.6, at the time of writing. These changes will be made with a 5.0.0 version and later.\r\n\r\n**Note:** _This deprecation doesn‚Äôt apply to the System.Data.SqlClient namespace in .NET Framework._\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n\r\nDaily downloads of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient on nuget.org are nearing 50% higher than System.Data.SqlClient. We expect the gap in usage between the two libraries will continue to increase. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is the best library we offer to access SQL Server.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing high-quality, performance-driven, and secure data access technologies. We strongly encourage users to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. It is actively maintained and supports the latest SQL Server features.\r\n\r\n### How to migrate? \r\n\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project, then update your references and using statements. Our [porting cheat sheet](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/blob/master/porting-cheat-sheet.md) provides a step-by-step set of changes you may need to make.\r\n\r\n1. **Update your project references:** Replace references to System.Data.SqlClient with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n2. **Modify your using statements:** Update your using statements in your code files from System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n3. **Test your application:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected after the migration.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to [support semi-automatic migration](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/issues/1593) via [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant).\r\n\r\n**Support & Feedback:** If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please reach out through our [official support channels](https://support.microsoft.com/) or join the discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues).\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions - dotnet/SqlClient Wiki - GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\n- [Introduction to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16)\r\n- [SQL Server and ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql)\r\n- [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Standard":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreFx":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"42841795291","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-14T23:37:38","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/75508","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix symbol package name\" (#75508) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"It seems \"Symbols\" in the symbol package name has to be capitalized to be skipped for nuget publishing ([val build log](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=10386730&view=logs&j=d8f66498-7756-5707-3b43-f2312930a35f&t=bbe08150-3f17-5cb4-1e71-ad095ec298fb))\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/d408230503cc2ba987fae8e29df7dd73892413d6/eng/publish-assets.ps1#L73\r\n"},{"Id":"42841734134","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-14T23:33:12","Actor":"genlu","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/75508","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Fix symbol package name\" (#75508) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"It seems \"Symbols\" in the symbol package name has to be capitalized to be skipped for nuget publishing ([val build log](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=10386730&view=logs&j=d8f66498-7756-5707-3b43-f2312930a35f&t=bbe08150-3f17-5cb4-1e71-ad095ec298fb))\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/d408230503cc2ba987fae8e29df7dd73892413d6/eng/publish-assets.ps1#L73\r\n"},{"Id":"42841734044","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-14T23:33:12","Actor":"dibarbet","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/75509","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Warn instead of crashing if we get a request with unknown language\" (#75509) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Resolves https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/issues/7656\r\n\r\nSometimes VSCode will send a request or two with the old URI after it renames a temporary file.

The only legal syntax they can have is `X = { }` which is a no-op setter, and since it's more of a trick than is being actually used, we do not offer the user the recommendation. They are still free to use the unrecommended members in the initializer, but only being able to \"assign\" `{ }` as shown above.\r\n\r\nWe only filter `Array` itself because it does not support indexing. Array types with a concrete rank can be indexed within the initializer like so:\r\n```csharp\r\nnew()\r\n{\r\n    // assume Array2D is int[,]\r\n    Array2D = { [0, 0] = value, [0, 1] = value1 },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\nThis is limited to just the known types as specified above. Other types that could be filtered out with the same properties, which would require traversing their members on-demand. This is a risky option because of the performance implications that could heavily affect the performance of the recommendation service which is intended to operate in real-time. It would be nice to have, but my personal view on solving that leans towards a cached value showing whether the type symbol can support object or collection initializers, being synchronized as the compilation is updated. Such a system would be very complicated and is not taken yet into consideration."},{"Id":"42840646618","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-14T22:25:52","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/75506","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Suggestion: warn on use of \"not A or B\" pattern matching syntax\" (#75506) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"## Problem summary\n\nI have observed significant ecosystem use of the `is not <a> or <b>` pattern matching syntax recently. However, it appears that much of the usage is incorrect due to developers misunderstanding the order of operations during evaluation.\n\nIn colloquial usage, the phrase \"if _x_ is not _y_ or _z_\" is understood by most participants to mean \"if _x_ is neither _y_ nor _z_.\" (That is: `¬¨(y ‚à® z)`, or `(¬¨y) ‚àß (¬¨z)`.) Instead, in C#, the expression is understood by the compiler to mean `(¬¨y) ‚à® z`.\n\nIn fairness, this mirrors the more traditional Boolean syntax `if (!y || z)`, where the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator. However, there's evidence that developers largely do not expect this same precedence when using the new pattern matching syntax, perhaps because it throws their brains into colloquial English mode rather than software engineering mode.\n\n## Evidence\n\nI searched for the `not <x> or <y>` pattern across all first-party code bases using CodeQL and found 96 files which use the pattern, then I manually inspected each file to see whether the author intended the colloquial \"neither / nor\" meaning or the engineering \"not / or\" meaning. Of the 96 results, 85 of them indicate incorrect usage. **That's an 89% error rate for developers using this syntax.**\n\nI can't share exact internal data, but you can see this using normal GitHub scans as well.\n\n* Searching for `is not null or ...` ([link](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%24%5Cs*if%5Cs*%5C%28%5B%5Cs%5Cw%5D*is+not+null+or%2F+language%3AC%23&type=code))\n* Searching for `is not \"literal\" or ...` ([link](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%24%5Cs*if%5Cs*%5C%28%5B%5Cs%5Cw%5D*is+not+%5C%22%5B%5E%5C%22%5D*%5C%22+or%2F+language%3AC%23&type=code))\n* Searching for `is not 0 or ...` ([link](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%24%5Cs*if%5Cs*%5C%28%5B%5Cs%5Cw%5D*is+not+0+or%2F+language%3AC%23&type=code))\n\nThe top offenders seem to be these patterns:\n\n* `is not null or <anything>`\n* `is not \"literal string\" or \"different literal string\"`\n* `is not MyEnum.SomeValue or MyEnum.OtherValue`\n* `is not LiteralInt or DifferentLiteralInt`\n\nThere are variations, but they're a long tail compared to the above.\n\n## Proposal\n\nI propose that the C# compiler produce a warning for any occurrence of `not a or b` unless the first expression is parenthesized like `(not a) or b`. This should make it clear to developers what the interpreted order of operations will be.\n\n## Further exploration\n\nAt the request of the C# team in a group chat, I also searched for occurrences of the `is not <x> and <y>` pattern. That is - we wondered if developers also frequently misinterpreted \"not / and\" as \"neither / nor\" - same as they were doing with \"not / or\". An internal scan showed only one or two questionable hits. The team may want to consider making this a warning as well for symmetry, but I am unable to provide evidence that \"not / and\" is causing developers to run into the same kind of issue.\n\nAs a general consideration, if the developer writes `x or y` (or `x || y`), and if the compiler can prove that `y ‚áí x`, then the compiler may want to consider emitting a warning, because it means the _y_ component of those expressions will never evaluate to true.\n\nFor example, given `is not null or \"\"`, an empty string implicitly satisfies not null.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

The only legal syntax they can have is `X = { }` which is a no-op setter, and since it's more of a trick than is being actually used, we do not offer the user the recommendation. They are still free to use the unrecommended members in the initializer, but only being able to \"assign\" `{ }` as shown above.\r\n\r\nWe only filter `Array` itself because it does not support indexing.

Other types that could be filtered out with the same properties, which would require traversing their members on-demand. This is a risky option because of the performance implications that could heavily affect the performance of the recommendation service which is intended to operate in real-time. It would be nice to have, but my personal view on solving that leans towards a cached value showing whether the type symbol can support object or collection initializers, being synchronized as the compilation is updated. Such a system would be very complicated and is not taken yet into consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/75507","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Restrict some types in object initializer setters when not directly settable\" (#75507)"},{"Id":"2587182038","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-14T22:25:51","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"75506","RawContent":null,"Title":"Suggestion: warn on use of \"not A or B\" pattern matching syntax","State":"open","Body":"## Problem summary\n\nI have observed significant ecosystem use of the `is not <a> or <b>` pattern matching syntax recently. However, it appears that much of the usage is incorrect due to developers misunderstanding the order of operations during evaluation.\n\nIn colloquial usage, the phrase \"if _x_ is not _y_ or _z_\" is understood by most participants to mean \"if _x_ is neither _y_ nor _z_.\" (That is: `¬¨(y ‚à® z)`, or `(¬¨y) ‚àß (¬¨z)`.) Instead, in C#, the expression is understood by the compiler to mean `(¬¨y) ‚à® z`.\n\nIn fairness, this mirrors the more traditional Boolean syntax `if (!y || z)`, where the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator. However, there's evidence that developers largely do not expect this same precedence when using the new pattern matching syntax, perhaps because it throws their brains into colloquial English mode rather than software engineering mode.\n\n## Evidence\n\nI searched for the `not <x> or <y>` pattern across all first-party code bases using CodeQL and found 96 files which use the pattern, then I manually inspected each file to see whether the author intended the colloquial \"neither / nor\" meaning or the engineering \"not / or\" meaning. Of the 96 results, 85 of them indicate incorrect usage. **That's an 89% error rate for developers using this syntax.**\n\nI can't share exact internal data, but you can see this using normal GitHub scans as well.\n\n* Searching for `is not null or ...` ([link](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%24%5Cs*if%5Cs*%5C%28%5B%5Cs%5Cw%5D*is+not+null+or%2F+language%3AC%23&type=code))\n* Searching for `is not \"literal\" or ...` ([link](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%24%5Cs*if%5Cs*%5C%28%5B%5Cs%5Cw%5D*is+not+%5C%22%5B%5E%5C%22%5D*%5C%22+or%2F+language%3AC%23&type=code))\n* Searching for `is not 0 or ...` ([link](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%24%5Cs*if%5Cs*%5C%28%5B%5Cs%5Cw%5D*is+not+0+or%2F+language%3AC%23&type=code))\n\nThe top offenders seem to be these patterns:\n\n* `is not null or <anything>`\n* `is not \"literal string\" or \"different literal string\"`\n* `is not MyEnum.SomeValue or MyEnum.OtherValue`\n* `is not LiteralInt or DifferentLiteralInt`\n\nThere are variations, but they're a long tail compared to the above.\n\n## Proposal\n\nI propose that the C# compiler produce a warning for any occurrence of `not a or b` unless the first expression is parenthesized like `(not a) or b`. This should make it clear to developers what the interpreted order of operations will be.\n\nI don't propose warning on `!a || b` unless there is evidence this pattern trips people up. I have never seen such evidence myself, nor am I actively searching for such evidence.\n\n## Further exploration\n\nAt the request of the C# team in a group chat, I also searched for occurrences of the `is not <x> and <y>` pattern. That is - we wondered if developers also frequently misinterpreted \"not / and\" as \"neither / nor\" - same as they were doing with \"not / or\". An internal scan showed only one or two questionable hits. The team may want to consider making this a warning as well for symmetry, but I am unable to provide evidence that \"not / and\" is causing developers to run into the same kind of issue.\n\nAs a general consideration, if the developer writes `x or y` (or `x || y`), and if the compiler can prove that `y ‚áí x`, then the compiler may want to consider emitting a warning, because it means the _y_ component of those expressions will never evaluate to true.\n\nFor example, given `is not null or \"\"`, an empty string implicitly satisfies not null. This basically means that you'll always end up with `true || true` or `false || false`. If we charitably assume that developers aren't frequently in the business of writing throwaway code, perhaps this is an indication that they expected something else to happen?

When I click F12 in the API project on a function of the .Net standard project, the first time it opens the source file and show the function. When I close the source file and click again F12 on the same function then it opens a metadata file instead of the source file.\n\nI have done the following acctions which didn‚Äôt solve the issue:\n- removed and readded the project reference\n- deleted the hidden .vs folder\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 9/19/2024, 09:07 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

This only seems to occur for me trying to go to the definition in a VB project from a C# project, but not from VB to VB. I find that it is sporatic as to whether it will open the actual source file or the metadata, but in many cases, it rarely, or sometimes never, opens the actual source file.<br>\nSometimes removing and readding the project reference seems to fix the issue, but this only seems to be temporary, and this typically does not change the project files in any way. I have also tried deleting the .VS folder, but it does not help.<br>\nAlso note that I experienced this in version 17.10.4, which is why I updated to the latest. Testing it there I found that it has the same bad behaviour.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, ALT-F12 often seems to work correctly, even when F12 never does, although I cannot say that it does so 100% of the time. I am not sure why it works better, but it certainly is less intuitive to use.<br>\nUpdate:  In a recent project I was working on Alt-F12 failed to work, just like F12.  It seems to be sporatic as to what will make it work correctly.  I even tried rebooting, but that did not seem to completely eliminate the bad behaviour.</p>\n\n#### Mark Dell on 10/10/2024, 11:19 AM: \n\n<p>Note that while <a target='_blank' href=\"https:///user/1375554\">Filip Masset</a> has designated the this as [severity:It bothers me.

If a project contains a reference to a package with runtime identifiers no longer supported by .NET SDK 8, a [NETSDK1206](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/sdk-errors/netsdk1206) warning is reported when building.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe `CopyWithPrivateKey` methods that combine a certificate with its associated private key fail on macOS 15 when using in-memory (ephemeral) keys.  This failure is most commonly seen when creating new certificates via `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` or when loading a certificate and key from a PEM file (or files) with `X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem`, which utilize the affected methods.\r\n\r\nCallers of these methods on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\") will receive a `CryptographicException`, specifically `Interop+AppleCrypto+AppleCommonCryptoCryptographicException: The specified item is no longer valid. It may have been deleted from the keychain.`  The `dotnet dev-certs https` command relies on `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` and fails with this error.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects .NET 6, .NET 8, and .NET 9. The issue is addressed in the upcoming .NET 6.0.34, .NET 8.0.10, and 9.0.0-rc2 releases, scheduled for release in October 2024.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nmacOS 15 uses a different status code to indicate a key is not in a Keychain than prior versions do.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have not already upgraded to macOS 15 from a prior version and use .NET, you are not impacted by this issue.  If you are planning to upgrade to macOS 15, the workaround is to upgrade to .NET 6.0.34. .NET 8.0.10, or .NET 9.0.0-rc2 (scheduled for October 2024) prior to upgrading to macOS 15.\r\n\r\nLoading a certificate and its associated private key from a PKCS#12/PFX are not affected.  If you are using an application that supports loading a certificate (and associated private key) by either PFX or PEM, converting your PEM contents to PFX - and updating configuration appropriately -

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nWe [announced Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/) in the first half of 2019 and [shipped the first stable](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-1-0/ba-p/825859) package later that year. That release [coincided with .NET Core 3.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/#introducing-the-new-sqlclient). We‚Äôve been developing [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) in the [dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient) repo since that time, over the last five years. It‚Äôs now time to start the deprecation process for the [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) package. We plan to take a staged process to deprecation, with the intent to align support changes and associated code transition activities between these libraries to natural migration points between .NET major versions.\r\n\r\nAll System.Data.SqlClient users are encouraged to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. We offer improvements and significantly higher support via the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nWe intend to deprecate the System.Data.SqlClient package in stages.\r\n- **Before .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - Publish a new 5.0.0 package, including the following changes.\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 7 and earlier and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and earlier.\r\n  - Publish assets for the following target frameworks: .NET 8, .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n  - Add [Obsolete attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#obsolete-attribute) to .NET 8 and .NET Standard 2.0 assets. This will generate new warnings for .NET 8+ and .NET Standard users.\r\n  - Continue to offer security servicing, for .NET 8, and .NET Framework 4.6.2+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - No change\r\n  - We will not support this package for .NET 9+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 8 EOL:**\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 8 users (the .NET 8 library will be removed).\r\n  - Maintain support for .NET Framework 4.6.2+ users.\r\n  - Security servicing will be provided via .NET Framework, not the package, at that point.\r\n  - We do not expect to update the package again after this point.\r\n  - We will not mark the package as deprecated since it will only support .NET Framework users with an implementation provided by .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nWe will remove support in the package for unsupported .NET and .NET Framework versions at various stages of this deprecation plan. Users affected by those changes are encouraged to move to a supported .NET or .NET Framework version and to adopt the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove support for .NET 6 since it will go EOL shortly after this new package is released, even though .NET 6 will still be supported at the time. Publishing a .NET 8 library significantly simplifies the plan, both in terms of what we will deliver and what we need to explain.\r\n\r\nFor .NET dates, see [.NET Releases.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) .NET 9 will [GA in November](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) of this year. .NET 8 will go EOL in November, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe current package version of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) is 4.8.6, at the time of writing. These changes will be made with a 5.0.0 version and later.\r\n\r\n**Note:** _This deprecation doesn‚Äôt apply to the System.Data.SqlClient namespace in .NET Framework._\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n\r\nDaily downloads of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient on nuget.org are nearing 50% higher than System.Data.SqlClient. We expect the gap in usage between the two libraries will continue to increase. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is the best library we offer to access SQL Server.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing high-quality, performance-driven, and secure data access technologies. We strongly encourage users to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. It is actively maintained and supports the latest SQL Server features.\r\n\r\n### How to migrate? \r\n\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project, then update your references and using statements. Our [porting cheat sheet](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/blob/master/porting-cheat-sheet.md) provides a step-by-step set of changes you may need to make.\r\n\r\n1. **Update your project references:** Replace references to System.Data.SqlClient with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n2. **Modify your using statements:** Update your using statements in your code files from System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n3. **Test your application:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected after the migration.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to [support semi-automatic migration](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/issues/1593) via [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant).\r\n\r\n**Support & Feedback:** If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please reach out through our [official support channels](https://support.microsoft.com/) or join the discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues).\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions - dotnet/SqlClient Wiki - GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\n- [Introduction to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16)\r\n- [SQL Server and ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql)\r\n- [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcement: System.Data.SqlClient package is now deprecated\" (#322)"},{"Id":"2464032272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T19:08:47","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"321","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 Preview 7","State":"open","Body":"We are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Preview 7.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs [announced earlier](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293), starting with .NET 9, we no longer include an implementation of `BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (.NET Framework remains unchanged). The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type. Hence, setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient to use `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n* We published the [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide]. We'd appreciate if could give it a read and give us feedback by filling issues in the [dotnet/docs] repo.\r\n* If you experience issues related to BinaryFormatter's removal not addressed in this migration guide, please file an issue in the [dotnet/runtime][dotnet/runtime] repo and indicate that the issue is related to the removal of `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Why was it removed?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][security-guide]*\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that BinaryFormatter is unsafe. Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is a common weakness enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue: [CWE-502 \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"][CWE502]. `BinaryFormatter` is such a deserializer. We also cover this in the [BinaryFormatter security guide][security-guide].\r\n\r\n### What are my options to move forward?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][migration-guide]*\r\n\r\nYou have two options to address the removal of `BinaryFormatter`'s implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Migrate away from BinaryFormatter**. We strongly recommend you to investigate options to stop using `BinaryFormatter` due to the associated security risks. The [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide] lists several options.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep using BinaryFormatter**. If you need to continue using `BinaryFormatter` in .NET 9, you need to depend on the unsupported [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters][compat-pack] NuGet package, which restores the unsafe legacy functionality and replaces the throwing implementation.\r\n\r\n[compat-pack]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package\r\n[migration-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/\r\n[security-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide\r\n[CWE502]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\r\n[dotnet/docs]: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-general-issue.yml\r\n[dotnet/runtime]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/new\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106240.

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET. As Canonical does not build/publish .2xx and higher SDK feature bands due to breaking changes, new Snap will only support .1xx SDK feature band for the lifetime of a major .NET version.\r\n- .NET previews (.NET 9 previews) will not be available to install via Snap.\r\n\r\n   _Stay tuned for date and call to action to switch from old to new .NET Snaps._\r\n\r\n### Issue Log\r\nAfter ownership is transferred from Microsoft to Canonical in May, log any .NET Snap issues to the dotnet-snap repository under the Canonical org [https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcanonical%2Fdotnet-snap&data=05%7C02%7Cashitanagar%40microsoft.com%7Cc5b9b895923f4c11483908dc57efcb4c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638481934634983274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fvusMJ%2Fl94m3WaJvpM7kK85%2BzIXGLsenPt7BmKPtRSU%3D&reserved=0).\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n[.NET SDK Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-sdk)\r\n[Canonical GitHub Repository](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/304","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Snap Ownership Transfer from Microsoft to Canonical\" (#304)"},{"Id":"2234072927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T18:22:01","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"303","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 8.0.

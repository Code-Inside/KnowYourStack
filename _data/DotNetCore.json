See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs [announced earlier](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293), starting with .NET 9, we no longer include an implementation of `BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (.NET Framework remains unchanged). The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type. Hence, setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient to use `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n* We published the [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide]. We'd appreciate if could give it a read and give us feedback by filling issues in the [dotnet/docs] repo.\r\n* If you experience issues related to BinaryFormatter's removal not addressed in this migration guide, please file an issue in the [dotnet/runtime][dotnet/runtime] repo and indicate that the issue is related to the removal of `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Why was it removed?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][security-guide]*\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that BinaryFormatter is unsafe. Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is a common weakness enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue: [CWE-502 \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"][CWE502]. `BinaryFormatter` is such a deserializer. We also cover this in the [BinaryFormatter security guide][security-guide].\r\n\r\n### What are my options to move forward?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][migration-guide]*\r\n\r\nYou have two options to address the removal of `BinaryFormatter`'s implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Migrate away from BinaryFormatter**. We strongly recommend you to investigate options to stop using `BinaryFormatter` due to the associated security risks. The [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide] lists several options.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep using BinaryFormatter**. If you need to continue using `BinaryFormatter` in .NET 9, you need to depend on the unsupported [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters][compat-pack] NuGet package, which restores the unsafe legacy functionality and replaces the throwing implementation.\r\n\r\n[compat-pack]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package\r\n[migration-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/\r\n[security-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide\r\n[CWE502]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\r\n[dotnet/docs]: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-general-issue.yml\r\n[dotnet/runtime]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/new\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106240.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key.

And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43141","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix ReadOnlySequence created out of sliced Memory owned by MemoryManager\" (#43141)"},{"Id":"1224389900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:24:35","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.26","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43143","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.26\" (#43143)"},{"Id":"1202264239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T04:53:34","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43142)"},{"Id":"1193653850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:51:59","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Roslyn-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2467218196","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-15T02:35:11","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"74765","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: Allow user to control if they want generated-doc results to appear in navigate to.","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74765","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: Allow user to control if they want generated-doc results to appear in navigate to.\" (#74765)"},{"Id":"2467019099","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-15T00:13:37","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"74764","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-35214.134","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/2158b59104a5fb7db33796657d4ab3231e312302...bba7ceac50f68468ec9733a6a66f2314227101d4?w=1)\n- [Refactor semantic snippets (74712)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74712)\n- [Use existing property to access services](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74749)\n- [Disable build on test refresh (74751)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74751)\n- [Switch to primary constructor](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74748)\n- [Fix some small things with readme (74709)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74709)\n- [Avoid async void methods](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74744)\n- [Switch API to immutable-array from params-array](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74741)\n- [Fix URI comparisons for different casing (74746)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74746)\n- [Remove implicit unsafe cast in foreach](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74747)\n- [Remove unnecessary type for wrapping analyzer references.](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74739)\n- [Some minor renames/cleanup before an upcoming large refactoring](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74743)\n- [Send a TextDocumentidentifier for razor dynamic file requests/responses (74727)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74727)\n- [Rename file and wrap long parameter list](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74735)\n- [Modify MergedNamespaceDeclaration.MakeChildren to to allocate less (74698)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74698)\n- [Preserve document extension for the preview content we create](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74724)\n- [Remove unused parameter in analyzer loading code](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74720)\n- [Reenable workspace pull diagnostics](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74722)\n- [Make analyzer mvid part of our checksum](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74721)\n- [Disable targeted notifications in integration tests (73987)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73987)\n- [Revise usage of `<code>` tag in `IOperation` docs (74719)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74719)\n- [Modify ISyntaxTreeFactoryService.CreateSyntaxTree to take in an optional SourceText.

That is, something that doesn't contribute to the compilation, or even do anything other than appear in the run result for the generator.\r\n\r\nRazor would like to use this to store the intermediate state that was used to generate documents, which is needed for the tooling.\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful in testing scenarios. We have lots of places today where we want to check something was called, or some operation produced some output, and we 'smuggle' the result out by adding some source with a content like `// {result.ToString()}`. Host outputs would allow us an easy mechanism to do this sort of result-based testing.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nImplementation PR: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74750/\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis\r\n{\r\n    public readonly partial struct IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext\r\n    {\r\n+       public void RegisterHostOutput<TSource>(IncrementalValueProvider<TSource> source, Action<HostOutputProductionContext, TSource> action);\r\n+\r\n+       public void RegisterHostOutput<TSource>(IncrementalValuesProvider<TSource> source, Action<HostOutputProductionContext, TSource> action);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n+   public readonly struct HostOutputProductionContext\r\n+   {\r\n+        /// <summary>\r\n+        /// Adds a host specific output\r\n+        /// </summary>\r\n+        /// <param name=\"name\">The name of the output to be added.</param>\r\n+        /// <param name=\"value\">The output to be added.</param>\r\n+        /// <remarks>\r\n+        /// A host output has no defined use.

We decided on `string` because there were worries about things like serialization and how we would handle that. This proposal switches back to `object` as the seralization overhead for Razor is going to be far too much and we've explicitly designed co-hosting to live in the same process.\r\n\r\nFor third party usage, I think we should just make it clear that it's entirely up to the host what happens with these outputs, and there is no defined expectation. \r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease mention any risks that to your knowledge the API proposal might entail, such as breaking changes, performance regressions, etc.\r\n-->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/74753","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RegisterHostOutputs\" (#74753)"},{"Id":"2464440955","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T23:06:45","Actor":"jkoritzinsky","Number":"74752","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use the Microsoft.Bcl.Memory package for the System.Index/System.Range implementation downlevel","State":"open","Body":"The .NET Libraries team has recently shipped a new assembly, Microsoft.Bcl.Memory, which defines the System.Index and System.Range types for downlevel usage.

This would enable core source generator authors to:\r\n\r\n- **Check the state of user-defined metadata**\r\n- **Allow third-party or the same authors to generate code** based on the information shared among authors of custom data through the proposed provider.\r\n- **Integrate or extend existing generated code** by creating an execution mechanism, (could evolving into a tree-execution-queue).\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach comes with performance concerns, such as potential deadlocks, especially when relying on extension SGen authors’ implementations. To mitigate these issues, one solution could involve propagating the cancel token and execute 3rd party SGens with some predefined timeout.\r\n\r\n#### Key-points\r\n\r\n- Coordination of 3rd party SGens, though can they cause waiting subsequent dependent (also the reason of the cancellation token and timeout, something you the team can consider to be taken differently)\r\n- Avoid implementation collisions (namings and duplicate implementations)\r\n- Obviously, compilation contexts (as well as nodes and syntaxes) can't be shared or accessed by different authors. (only metadata, not generation context)\r\n- Subsequent generators must generate their own code only based on the given metadata shared by core SGens authors and can be combined with other providers\r\n- Shared metadata should be an intermediary assembly not being the same core SGens assembly (not a good idea I guess)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Proposed API**\r\n\r\nTo address the outlined scenario, the following API can be introduced:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic sealed class AnalyzerExtensibilityProvider\r\n{\r\n    static IncrementalValueProvider<T> Publish<T>(T exchangedData, CancellationToken cancelToken);\r\n    static IncrementalValueProvider<AnalyzerSubscription<T>> SubscribeTo<T>(Func<T, CancellationToken, bool> exchangedData);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic sealed class AnalyzerSubscription<T>\r\n{\r\n    public T State { get; }\r\n    // Report back to the publisher the current state changes\r\n    public void Return(CancellationToken token);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n> ### Names are proposal. Maybe you can provide better ones according to their usage context\r\n- **`Publish<T>`**: Allows the core source generator to publish data to third-party consumers.\r\n- **`SubscribeTo<T>`**: Allows third-party authors to subscribe to the data published by the core source generator.\r\n- **`AnalyzerSubscription<T>`**: Represents the subscription, allowing subscribers to return the state changes to the publisher.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Usage Sample**\r\n\r\n#### **Core Source Generator Author Example**\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar compilationProvider = incrementalGeneratorInitializationContext.CompilationProvider;\r\n\r\n// Usage of AnalyzerExtensibilityProvider as a property\r\nvar extensibilityProvider = incrementalGeneratorInitializationContext.AnalyzerExtensibilityProvider;\r\n\r\nvar collectedServiceContainerSymbols = context.SyntaxProvider\r\n    .ForAttributeWithMetadataName(ServiceContainerAttributeFQName,\r\n        (node, a) => true,\r\n        (t, c) => (t.SemanticModel, Class: (INamedTypeSymbol)t.TargetSymbol)) \r\n    .Collect();\r\n\r\nincrementalGeneratorInitializationContext.RegisterSourceOutput(\r\n    compilationProvider\r\n        .Combine(extensibilityProvider)\r\n        .Combine(collectedServiceContainerSymbols), \r\n    (sourceProducer, ((compilation, interop), collectedServiceContainer), cancellationToken) => {\r\n\r\n        HashSet<string> namesSet = new(NameUniquenessComparer); //ensure file name uniquness name\r\n\r\n        foreach (var (semanticModel, serviceContainerSymbol) in collectedServiceContainer)\r\n        {\r\n            if(ServiceContainerGenerator\r\n                .DiscoverServicesFor(\r\n                    compilation, \r\n                    semanticModel,\r\n                    serviceContainerSymbol,\r\n                    namesSet,\r\n                    unresolvedDependencyHandler: (ServiceMetadata serviceDesc) => {\r\n                                                  // ServiceMetadata type is hosted at some core-author assembly \r\n                                                  // to exchange custom metadata info with other interested SGen writers\r\n                        interop.Publish(serviceDesc, cancellationToken);\r\n                    })\r\n                .TryBuild(out string fileName, out string code))\r\n            {\r\n                sourceProducer.AddSource(fileName, code);\r\n            };\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### **Third-Party Source Generator Author Example**\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar compilationProvider = incrementalGeneratorInitializationContext.CompilationProvider;\r\n\r\n// Usage of AnalyzerExtensibilityProvider as a property\r\nvar emittedLoggerServices = incrementalGeneratorInitializationContext.AnalyzerExtensibilityProvider\r\n    .SubscribeTo<ServiceMetadata>((serviceMetadataSub, cancelToken) => \r\n    {\r\n        if (IsLogger(serviceMetadataSub.State))\r\n        {\r\n            serviceMetadataSubscription.State.Resolved = true;\r\n            serviceMetadataSubscription.State.Name = serviceMetadataSubscription.;\r\n            // Reports changes made to the current shared state for this SGen \r\n            // and no more changes can be reported in order to avoid delay on core-sgen publisher of this metadata\r\n            serviceMetadataSubscription.Return(cancelToken); \r\n\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n        return false;\r\n    })\r\n    .Collect();\r\n\r\nincrementalGeneratorInitializationContext.RegisterPostInitializationOutput(CreateLoggerFactory);\r\n    \r\nincrementalGeneratorInitializationContext.RegisterSourceOutput(\r\n    compilationProvider.Combine(emittedLoggerServices), \r\n    (sourceProducer, info, cancellationToken) => {\r\n        var (compilation, emittedLoggerServicesData) = info;\r\n        // Proceed to generate third-party code, with the help of the current Compilation context \r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Risks**\r\n\r\n- **Performance Concerns**: The proposed mechanism could lead to potential deadlocks, particularly when extension SGen authors' implementations are not well-coordinated.\r\n- **Broadcasting Solution**: As a potential mitigation, broadcasting shared types might alleviate some of these risks, but this too introduces its own challenges in managing the broadcast and ensuring consistent state across participants.\r\n\r\n@sharwell ...

This telemetry is reported through [MSBuild's built-in telemetry hooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.build.utilities.tasklogginghelper.logtelemetry?view=msbuild-16#microsoft-build-utilities-tasklogginghelper-logtelemetry(system-string-system-collections-generic-idictionary((system-string-system-string)))), which for the `dotnet` CLI ends up forwarding telemetry from MSBuild through the CLI Telemetry's configuration (aka the environment variable mentioned above: `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`). \r\n\r\nThere was a bug in the MSBuild engine's handling of this telemetry data, which we fixed [in this PR](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10464), and this bug is the cause of the crash that's reported. We found this error during final testing, but too late to include it in the 400 release, and so began the process of making a hotfix immediately. This hotfix, 8.0.401, should be available in the next day or so.\r\n\r\nThe main reason we decided to do a hotfix for this is that the proposed workaround - setting `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` to `1`/`true`/other truthy values - did not consistently work in broader testing. This is because MSBuild is a multi-node system, and telemetry events generated on a worker node must be serialized and forwarded to the central node. This serialization is where the bug lies. If you can guarantee that MSBuild operates in a single-node mode (via `/m:1` or similar) that may work as a workaround as well, but several high-impact use cases like `azd` deployment do not expose the configuration necessary to ensure this behavior.\r\n            \r\n\r\nOther reports:\r\n* https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/10437\r\n* https://github.com/dotnet/sdk-container-builds/issues/587\r\n* https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10518\r\n* https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/42719","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/42731","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[8.0.400] MSBuild Crash when publishing containers\" (#42731)"},{"Id":"2465977833","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-14T14:13:50","Actor":"ronymeyer","Number":"42730","RawContent":null,"Title":"Razer escape @@ results in build error since SDK 8.0.400","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nSince preview of 8.0.400 and now also in final version of 8.0.400 compilation of razor pages containing @@ fail with:\r\n\r\nFileName.cshtml: error CS9008: Sequence of '@' characters is not allowed.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs [announced earlier](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293), starting with .NET 9, we no longer include an implementation of `BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (.NET Framework remains unchanged). The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type. Hence, setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient to use `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n* We published the [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide]. We'd appreciate if could give it a read and give us feedback by filling issues in the [dotnet/docs] repo.\r\n* If you experience issues related to BinaryFormatter's removal not addressed in this migration guide, please file an issue in the [dotnet/runtime][dotnet/runtime] repo and indicate that the issue is related to the removal of `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Why was it removed?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][security-guide]*\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that BinaryFormatter is unsafe. Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is a common weakness enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue: [CWE-502 \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"][CWE502]. `BinaryFormatter` is such a deserializer. We also cover this in the [BinaryFormatter security guide][security-guide].\r\n\r\n### What are my options to move forward?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][migration-guide]*\r\n\r\nYou have two options to address the removal of `BinaryFormatter`'s implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Migrate away from BinaryFormatter**. We strongly recommend you to investigate options to stop using `BinaryFormatter` due to the associated security risks. The [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide] lists several options.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep using BinaryFormatter**. If you need to continue using `BinaryFormatter` in .NET 9, you need to depend on the unsupported [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters][compat-pack] NuGet package, which restores the unsafe legacy functionality and replaces the throwing implementation.\r\n\r\n[compat-pack]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package\r\n[migration-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/\r\n[security-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide\r\n[CWE502]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\r\n[dotnet/docs]: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-general-issue.yml\r\n[dotnet/runtime]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/new\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106240.

FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n\r\n Version:   8.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 8.0.3\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.5  Runtime or .NET 8.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.19 or SDK 7.0.119 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n\r\n Version:   8.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 8.0.3\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.5  Runtime or .NET 8.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.19 or SDK 7.0.119 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update.

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET.

It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BinaryFormatter is being removed in .NET 9\" (#293)"},{"Id":"2072888869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:52","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"292","RawContent":null,"Title":" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

You should also consider updating the System.Data.SqlClient package as keeping dependencies up to date is good general hygiene, but updating this package is neither necessary nor sufficient to fix the issue in a .NET Framework-based application.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the difference between Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient please read the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient initial announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/)  for an explanation,\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

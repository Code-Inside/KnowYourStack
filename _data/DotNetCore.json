Customer reported this impact in a migration from .NET Framework to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Packaging Impact\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\nRegression from .NET Core 1.0, and .NET Framework.\r\n \r\n### Testing\r\nSee benchmark testing in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/32767.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow. The change avoids the cache and allocates a distinct `Expression<TDelegate>` each time.\r\n\r\ncc @ericstj"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"19231930374","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-12-08T05:23:55","Actor":"davidwengier","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/57996","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"[SourceLink] Create output window for logging, and tell the user what is going on\" (#57996) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/57352\r\nPart of #55834\r\nIncludes #57978 so just review [`33072b9` (#57996)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/57996/commits/33072b9b176d16a6913152a036529b7f478beb44)\r\n\r\nThe idea is to help library authors work out why their embedded or source link sources might not be working, we can provide this output window.

This can cause lock contention in high-traffic applications if multiple threads call these methods concurrently. We discovered this contention issue while investigating the contention issue described in https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28201.\r\n\r\nThis fix does not remove the lock outright, but it shrinks the window in which any given thread holds the lock. Previously, the logic was:\r\n\r\n1. Acquire the lock.\r\n2. Compute the key which will be used to query the dictionary. (Computing the key is string concatenation.)\r\n3. Query the dictionary.\r\n4. Release the lock.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the key is computed (2) _before_ the lock is taken (1). This means that the only operation which takes place within the lock is a dictionary lookup - not a string concatenation - and such lookups are expected to be very fast.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. This is a perf improvement compared to 3.1 RTM. Aside from the perf improvement, no behavioral changes should be observed.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow. This does not change the logical flow of this method, as all string components are already floating around within the method as locals. We're not introducing any new method calls (aside from the string allocation itself) outside the lock.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to port https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26567 in its entirety. That PR fixes some race conditions in this code in addition to moving the string concatenation before the lock acquisition. That PR has been baking in the product since 5.0 RTM and we have not received any complaints about it, so it should be considered stable if we'd instead prefer to bring that along. However, it is larger than the absolute minimum necessary to solve the lock contention issue the customer is seeing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28202","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Reduce lock contentions in GetCultureInfoHelper\" (#28202)"},{"Id":"991644745","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-09-13T17:14:20","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"28201","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Port dotnet/runtime#40116 (MemberInfo lock contention) to 3.1","State":"closed","Body":"Ports the fix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35851 from 5.0 to 3.1 per customer request.\r\n\r\n## Customer impact\r\n\r\nThe methods `Type.GetMethod` and `Type.GetField` take a per-Type lock while searching for the target member. This can cause lock contention in high-traffic applications if multiple threads call these methods concurrently on the same Type instance. We've received reports of customers' applications impacted by this contention and their RPS dropping precipitiously.\r\n\r\nThe fix avoids the lock entirely in the common case where all MemberInfo instances have already been cached. Multiple threads can walk this cache concurrently without contention.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. This is a perf improvement compared to 3.1 RTM. Aside from the perf improvement, no behavioral changes should be observed.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow. This change originally went in to 5.0, and we've received no bug reports for these code paths since 5.0 RTM shipped. The code path also \"fails safe\", meaning that if the cache appears to be improperly initialized (perhaps because another thread is currently in the process of updating it) the method will fall back down the slower \"take the lock\" code path.

Any providers declared in machine.config / app.config would be ignored (only the programmatic registration would apply). \r\n\r\nIs there a workaround while we migrate our application to .NET 5?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1790","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide DbProviderFactories as NuGet Package for .NET Standard 2.0\" (#1790)"},{"Id":"852541719","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-07T15:50:35","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"1788","RawContent":null,"Title":"Class ValueTask has different definitions between .Net Standard 2.1 and .Net 5","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Class-ValueTask-has-different-definition/1384249)._\n\n---\nClass ValueTask has different definitions between .Net Standard 2.1 and .Net 5: \nstatic property ValueTask.CompletedTask and static methods ValueTask.FromResult, ValueTask.FromCanceled and ValueTask.FromException are not available in .Net Standard 2.1.\n\nRegards,\nPaco.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 3/29/2021, 10:45 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"705166145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-20T19:05:41","Actor":"Korporal","Number":"1775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confusing behavior when using AssemblyInfo.cs ","State":"open","Body":"I'm completely perplexed.\r\n\r\nI created a .Net Standard 2.0 library project.\r\n\r\nI explicity added an AssemblyInfo.cs file, we need this because we use this utility to \"stamp\" our assemblies when we build them:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ygoe/NetRevisionTool\r\n\r\nThat utility is run as a pre/post build event and temporarily replaces placeholders in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute with runtime values (like repo folder name, commit ID, branch etc etc).\r\n\r\nThe completed assembly then has this info \"burned\" into it as we go forward.\r\n\r\n.Net Standard is not working with this.\r\n\r\n1.

when a window update (WINDOW_UPDATE frame) is received at the same time as the HTTP/2 request is being completed.\r\nWe saw the very same problem in 5.0 in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220 (reported by customer) and fixed it in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769 for .NET 5.0.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in firstly locking connection sync object and then stream's (window update) while request completions attempts to lock stream and than connection.\r\n\r\nIn 5.0 (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769), we've split `Http2Stream` lock into 2 objects, one for the stream itself (used for completion etc.) and other for credit handling (window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\nIn 3.1, `Http2Stream` looks slightly different and uses credit manager's sync object as stream's sync object. So redefining stream's sync object to lock over `this` achieves the same thing as the fix in 5.0 since operations over `Http2Stream` are guarded with stream's lock and operations with credit lock credit manager itself (separate sync object for window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReliability problem.\r\nReported by customer using YARP. They are hitting it for specific backend server (likely due to timing). Temporary workaround is to disable HTTP/2 for the endpoint - such solution does not scale for larger number of backends and might not be acceptable for other backends.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\nLocal test run for 3.1.\r\nWhen we fixed the issue in 5.0, we got a confirmation from the reporting customer that the fix helped and that it didn't break anything.\r\nYARP customer needing the 3.1 fix is unable to verify the fix on unsigned binaries.\r\n\r\n### Link to PR / issue in main\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220\r\n6.0 (main) PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769\r\n5.0.5 servicing PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47921\r\n\r\n### Is there a packaging impact?\r\n\r\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43116","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[H/2] Split lock to prevent deadlock in WindowUpdate processing\" (#43116)"},{"Id":"1005855962","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-10-14T20:50:03","Actor":"jonfortescue","Number":"43109","RawContent":null,"Title":"Switch to 1ES servicing pools on release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"Tracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core-eng/issues/14276","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43109","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Switch to 1ES servicing pools on release/3.1\" (#43109)"},{"Id":"1024511482","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-10-13T17:20:09","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43113","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43113","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43113)"},{"Id":"1024513240","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-10-12T23:03:10","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43114","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43114","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43114)"},{"Id":"1021364082","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-10-12T23:02:00","Actor":"safern","Number":"43112","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add SetLastError to Gdiplus PInvokes","State":"closed","Body":"Given that the files are very different on the 6.0/7.0 branch because we did some cleanup, I had to do a manual port of the changes in: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/ca74e9a05558533827369b14ee507da46bdc0fd8\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nRegression from .NETFramework and .NETCore causing a unexpected `ExternalException` related to session transitions (sleep/wake, Remote Desktop, etc)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nVery low.

I don't recall it ever happening when running things from a Linux host (or WSL2 Ubuntu instance).\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n[I've setup an example in this repo](https://github.com/grangerg/dotnetBuildHang).  It's just the VS2022 \"Empty Asp.Net Core\" project template being built by a Powershell script. Just clone the repo somewhere and run the `_deploy.ps1` script. If you clone the repo into Azure, you can use the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to run the build.\r\n\r\nThe very first time you run `_deploy.ps1` on a Windows host, it'll hang after the build/publish completes. The second time, it's fast. I've found that, almost all of the time, you can make it hang again if you modify the timestamp on `Program.cs` in between builds (e.g. open it, add a space, remove the space, save the file).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\nI've experienced this in Windows 10 Home, Professional, and in an Azure \"windows-2022\" based pipeline. I was able to reproduce the issue locally while using the `-bl` switch, so I've attached that [msbuild.binlog.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/files/7672458/msbuild.binlog.zip). Note that the .binlog was completely generated before the \"hang\". I.e. it was created and modified almost instantly, and then `dotnet` hung for the ~10min before finally exiting, and no further modifications were made to the .binlog file during the \"hang\" or after. Hopefully, it's still useful.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/22948","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet publish hangs in Windows for ~10min after completion\" (#22948)"},{"Id":"1073865174","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-08T00:11:36","Actor":"marcpopMSFT","Number":"22947","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update macos leg to 1015","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22947","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update macos leg to 1015\" (#22947)"},{"Id":"1073563827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T23:45:23","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"22939","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 5.0.405","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22939","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 5.0.405\" (#22939)"},{"Id":"1073563652","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T23:45:06","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"22937","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.417","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22937","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.417\" (#22937)"},{"Id":"1073563761","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T23:44:58","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"22938","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 5.0.211","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22938","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 5.0.211\" (#22938)"},{"Id":"1073846889","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T23:43:08","Actor":"TanayParikh","Number":"22946","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove AoT `Publish Test Results` Step","State":"open","Body":"Helix test results aren't output here, and since the AoT test suite is exclusively Helix tests, this step isn't needed.\r\n\r\nAvoids `##[warning]No test result files matching artifacts/TestResults/Release/*.xml were found.`\r\n\r\nExample: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=1501826&view=logs&j=c87185f3-6209-5c78-5ae3-375ac5d75c64&t=10041bc9-1a80-5757-2318-098cba9bf69b&l=11","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22946","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Remove AoT `Publish Test Results` Step\" (#22946)"},{"Id":"1073594942","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T23:41:08","Actor":"dsplaisted","Number":"22941","RawContent":null,"Title":"Switch to Ubuntu 1804 (6.0.1xx)","State":"closed","Body":"Port #22875 / #17260 to 6.0.1xx.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22941","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Switch to Ubuntu 1804 (6.0.1xx)\" (#22941)"},{"Id":"1073723576","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T23:29:44","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"22944","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:bdbeb850-6d82-4277-c391-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/templating\r\n- **Subscription**: bdbeb850-6d82-4277-c391-08d8e9750d9d\r\n- **Build**: 20211207.16\r\n- **Date Produced**: December 7, 2021 9:52:27 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: b01f72accf138c77b9a577d683062cd69b745322\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateSearch.Common**: [from 7.0.100-alpha.1.21606.3 to 7.0.100-alpha.1.21607.16][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ItemTemplates**: [from 7.0.100-alpha.1.21606.3 to 7.0.100-alpha.1.21607.16][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Abstractions**: [from 7.0.100-alpha.1.21606.3 to 7.0.100-alpha.1.21607.16][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Cli**: [from 7.0.100-alpha.1.21606.3 to 7.0.100-alpha.1.21607.16][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Orchestrator.RunnableProjects**: [from 7.0.100-alpha.1.21606.3 to 7.0.100-alpha.1.21607.16][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Utils**: [from 7.0.100-alpha.1.21606.3 to 7.0.100-alpha.1.21607.16][2]\r\n\r\n[2]: https://github.com/dotnet/templating/compare/b97a0a9...b01f72a\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:bdbeb850-6d82-4277-c391-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22944","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating\" (#22944)"},{"Id":"1073790565","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T22:03:16","Actor":"TanayParikh","Number":"22945","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unskip Blazor Integration Tests","State":"open","Body":"Tests were skipped to unblock https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22892.

I have a proxy setup script configured on a corporate laptop that does not apply for VPN connections (I'm on a VPN). However, NuGet will still use this configuration even though it does not apply. I then get errors trying to use any NuGet-related `dotnet` command, such as `dotnet add package` or `dotnet tool restore`. I will get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnable to load the service index for source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\r\nThe proxy tunnel request to proxy '<the internal proxy server>' failed with status code '407'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can reach that URL via a browser, and I can restore using Visual Studio. Upgrading from NuGet version 5.10 to 5.11 allowed me to use `nuget install Foo`. \r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nConfigure proxy to have:\r\n- Automatically detect settings ON\r\n- Use setup script ON\r\n- A script address to a proxy server that requires authentication\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n<!-- \r\nInclude the exception you get when facing this issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\nI validated on 6.0.100, 6.0.101, and 6.0.200-preview.21607.2.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/22942","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Embedded version of NuGet client does not respect \"no_proxy\" configuration\" (#22942)"},{"Id":"1073351935","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T17:20:04","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"22932","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:3d9043af-0e17-4eb5-f3e3-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 3d9043af-0e17-4eb5-f3e3-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 20211206.6\r\n- **Date Produced**: December 6, 2021 11:43:56 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 5d969787afb2fd87f642458687e3ad41094ac3ab\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions**: [from 7.0.0-beta.21603.6 to 7.0.0-beta.21606.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.21603.6 to 7.0.0-beta.21606.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool**: [from 7.0.0-beta.21603.6 to 7.0.0-beta.21606.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.21603.6 to 7.0.0-beta.21606.6][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/b3e9491...5d96978\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:3d9043af-0e17-4eb5-f3e3-08d8e97c775d)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22932","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#22932)"},{"Id":"1073505220","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T17:06:52","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"22936","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/6.0.2xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/msbuild","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:96e706c0-2cf0-4ee9-89e0-08d99e509282)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild\r\n- **Subscription**: 96e706c0-2cf0-4ee9-89e0-08d99e509282\r\n- **Build**: 20211207.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: December 7, 2021 3:28:33 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: a70ee3087277b8d5c908d911ffca0e5deb19ecd5\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Build.Localization**: [from 17.1.0-preview-21607-01 to 17.1.0-preview-21607-02][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.Build**: [from 17.1.0-preview-21607-01 to 17.1.0-preview-21607-02][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/compare/7e5c40e...a70ee30\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:96e706c0-2cf0-4ee9-89e0-08d99e509282)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22936","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/6.0.2xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/msbuild\" (#22936)"},{"Id":"1073452470","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-07T14:58:43","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"22935","RawContent":null,"Title":"Localized file check-in by OneLocBuild Task: Build definition ID 140: Build ID 1500846","State":"open","Body":"This is the pull request automatically created by the OneLocBuild task in the build process to check-in localized files generated based upon translation source files (.lcl files) handed-back from the downstream localization pipeline.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) was shipped in May 30, 2018 and was declared an LTS release with the 2.1.3 update in August 2018. The 3-year lifecycle for the 2.1 release has come to an end on August 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.1 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.1 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.1, will be accessible through the [.NET Downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) page. \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.1 has reached end of life\" (#199)"},{"Id":"974082248","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-08-18T21:49:10","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Main is now targeting .NET 7","State":"open","Body":"This is a heads up that the primary repos of the stack have branched for .NET 6 GA/servicing/RCs, and that the `main` branch for those repos has become .NET 7.\r\n\r\n## Anything special to note about .NET 7?\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between .NET 6 and .NET 7 flow is that the SDK repos will have their own channel (.NET 7.0.1xx SDK) from the very beginning.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"updating-2.1\"></a> Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework\r\nIf you are running .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework you need to check your projects for dependencies and update them accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\n* If your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 2.1 incrementally. This means that users who reference the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` package must add a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\n* The shared framework for .NET Core 3.1 and later does not include `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.dll`. Users targeting netcoreapp3.1 or later must also update their `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package version.\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 3.1 and later completely. This means users who reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` can bump that version to 2.1.30. They don't need a new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` reference.\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core or .NET 5, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

At the same time, continuing to build for all frameworks we ever shipped increases the complexity and size of a package. In the past, we've solved this issue by *harvesting*, which basically means:\r\n \r\n1. We build only for \"current\" frameworks\r\n2. During build, we download the earlier version of the package and \"harvest\" the binaries for earlier frameworks we no longer build for\r\n \r\nWhile this means that you can always update without worrying that we drop a framework it also means that you'll never get any bug fixes or new features if you consume a harvested binary. In other words, harvested assets can't be serviced which is now hidden because from your point of view you're able to keep updating the package to a later version even thought you're consuming the same old binary that we're no longer updating.\r\n \r\nFor .NET 6, we plan to no longer perform any form of harvesting to ensure that all assets we ship can be serviced. This means we're dropping anything older than:\r\n\r\n* .NET Framework 4.6.1\r\n* .NET Core 3.1\r\n* .NET Standard 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're currently referencing an impacted package from an earlier framework, you'll no longer be able to update the referenced package to a later version. Your choice is to either retarget your project to a later version or not updating the referenced package (which is generally not a huge take back because you're already consuming a frozen binary anyways).\r\n \r\n## Affected packages\r\n\r\nThese packages no longer ship old frameworks:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry.AccessControl`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition.Registration`\r\n* `System.Composition.AttributedModel`\r\n* `System.Composition.Convention`\r\n* `System.Composition.Hosting`\r\n* `System.Composition.Runtime`\r\n* `System.Composition.TypedParts`\r\n* `System.Data.Odbc`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.EventLog`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols`\r\n* `System.Drawing.Common`\r\n* `System.IO.Packaging`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipelines`\r\n* `System.Management`\r\n* `System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler`\r\n* `System.Reflection.Context`\r\n* `System.Runtime.Caching`\r\n* `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData`\r\n* `System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController`\r\n* `System.Speech`\r\n* `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages`\r\n* `System.Text.Encodings.Web`\r\n* `System.Threading.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Threading.Channels`\r\n\r\nThese packages will no longer be updated because their implementation is now part of the .NET 6 platform:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.IO.FileSystem.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Principal.Windows`\r\n\r\n## Timelines\r\n\r\nMany of these changes are shipping in .NET 6 Preview 5 while some will ship in .NET 6 Preview 6.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please comment in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54365.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/190","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dropping older framework versions\" (#190)"},{"Id":"915260827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-06-08T17:03:51","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0 and .NET Core 3.1.

This shift is intended to make it easier for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) customers to choose whether to allow .NET 6 and beyond on their environments, without the side effects a key shared between multiple products might have.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nToday Microsoft signs .NET artifacts with a variety of certificates. For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change. Only newly built .NET 6 binaries will get the new certificate. Some tooling utilized in Visual Studio will remain on the existing cert.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nQuestions or concerns?

We decided that there is a value in having a unified naming convention across all our repos as opposed to having a split like \"new repos use `main`, existing repos use what they currently have\".

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\nUpdates: \r\n- [NuGet repository signature certificate will expire on April 14th, 2021](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/58)\r\n- [.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions using NSS or ca-certificates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/net-5-nuget-restore-failures-on-linux-distributions-using-nss-or-ca-certificates/) (NuGet blog)\r\n- [.NET April 2021 Updates – 5.0.5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-april-2021-updates/) (.NET blog)\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-3/)\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NuGet package restore broken on .NET 5+ with Removal of Trust of VeriSign CA\" (#180)"},{"Id":"837071846","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"Nirmal4G","Number":"179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master","State":"closed","Body":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179)"},{"Id":"826383777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:01:29","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"178","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 2.1.

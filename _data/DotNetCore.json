See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage both ASP.NET Core 2.1 and ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

\"Visual Studio 2019\" under Tools > Options > Text Editor > C# > Advanced for the Blue color theme as well as for the Dark color theme.\n\nWhen using the color theme \"Use system setting\" (under Tools > Options > Environment > General), the \"Editor Color Scheme\" option is not available any more. The message there states: _Editor color scheme options are only available when using a color theme bundled with Visual Studio. The color theme can be configured from the Environment > General options page_.\n\nThis is not expected behavior since the \"Use system settings\" color theme should just switch between the Blue and the Dark theme which both are bundled with Visual Studio. Unfortunately, I don't want to use the \"Use system setting\" color theme, when the \"Visual Studio 2019\" editor color scheme is not available there.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 3/25/2024, 08:29 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)"},{"Id":"44493700783","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-12-05T08:02:13","Actor":"JoeRobich","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76276","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Cache the MEF composition in the Roslyn LSP.\" (#76276) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"To improve startup time of the LSP we can cache the MEF composition and load it from file instead of building up a new composition.\r\n\r\nThe cache is invalidated when:\r\n1.

Most of the time they fail with OutOfMemory exceptions, sometimes segmentation faults. Before the build the machine is using 1.25 out of 8 GB RAM during the build it goes up to about 1.58 GB when looking at with htop, so whatever peaks OOM must be doing a huge allocation. Its a virtual ubuntu machine with no swap configured for performance. (This was preconfigured either by the VM hosting company or the ubuntu installation image and not configured by me so I assume its a common setup.)\n\nCommand line to publish is `dotnet publish server -c Release -f net9.0 -r linux-x64 --self-contained false -o /game/bin`\n\nWe had no issues building the same codebase in .NET 8, first few builds on .NET 9 were fine too, before it suddenly started to regularly fail with OOM. Nothing really changed on the machine side I'm aware of and I'd like to know if there's anything I can do to diagnose this further.\n\n### To Reproduce\nThe git repo where this occurs is not public

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Use an older Fody DLL (ReactiveUI.Fody I think version 19.5.41) to mutilate a .NET DLL.  (Put [Reactive] attribute on a property.)\n3. It adds System.Runtime version 8.0 to the DLL.  There is also already a System.Runtime version 9.0 in the DLL.  I suspect this is not supposed to be.  (I see two separate references in the DLL using dotPeek.)\n4. Debug with VS2022 preview or use `dotnet watch` and make a hot reload change.\n5. No matter what the change is, it fails with CS7038.\n\n**Diagnostic Id**:\n\nerror CS7038: Failed to emit module 'Xyz.Core': Changing the version of an assembly reference is not allowed during debugging: 'System.Runtime, Version=8.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' changed version to '9.0.0.0'.\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n\nHot reload works.\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n\nHot reload fails with this error:\n\n```\ndotnet watch :x: error CS7038: Failed to emit module 'Xyz.Core': Changing the version of an assembly reference is not allowed during debugging: 'System.Runtime, Version=8.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' changed version to '9.0.0.0'.\n```\n\n**Suggestions for fix**:\n\n- [Suggestion 1] Detect this scenario: the assembly has v8, v9 references of a DLL before Hot Reload, and the same two versions after, so do not fail with CS7038, because this is inaccurate: no assembly versions of references actually changed.\n- [Suggestion 2] Improve the error message in this scenario: \"DLLs are not allowed to have multiple references to the same DLL, with different version numbers.  Bad IL exception.\"  (...that's if this is true.  I have no idea.)\n\nNote on bigger picture: Hot Reload has a bad reputation for not working a lot of the time, so any time Microsoft can detect problems caused by 3rd parties (i.e. buggy Fody mutilations), it would be great, in order to rehabilitate the Hot Reload reputation.  I almost gave up on tracking this down but I'm glad I didn't.

This is an intuitive default as it means users generally don't have to think about pp trivia when removing nodes (since often the PP trivia is actually spread over many physical nodes, even though it looks to surround one 'virtual' node).\r\n\r\nHowever, the logic for actually doing this was not great.  When the api detected a PP directive to keep, it would grab *only* it and keep *only* that in the resultant tree.  This means that a PP-directive that was indented, would become indented, leading to ill formatted code.\r\n\r\nFor directives like `#if` this was rarely an issue as VS-formatting and the .Net ecosystem almost always has those left-aligned on column 1.  However, for `#region` directives, this was suboptimal as it meant the directive would go from being indented, to left-aligned.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to have the removal logic try to keep leading whitespace before the PP directive, to ensure that it stays at the same location, even when the rest of the trivia around it is removed","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76275","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix directive placement when removing nodes using syntax API.\" (#76275)"},{"Id":"2719065258","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-05T00:40:08","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"76274","RawContent":null,"Title":"Area - Remove Unnecessary Parentheses","State":"open","Body":"Parent issue tracking the \"Remove Unnecessary Parentheses\" area.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76274","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Area - Remove Unnecessary Parentheses\" (#76274)"},{"Id":"2719054532","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-05T00:28:23","Actor":"WeihanLi","Number":"76273","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update SystemTextJsonVersion","State":"open","Body":"fix vulnerability nuget audit\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bcfd26b-3cf9-47d7-a997-debfc550821e)\r\n\r\nmsbuild already using the `8.0.5` version\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ff3b76-4f1e-41ec-a699-8f7949147acf)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76273","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update SystemTextJsonVersion\" (#76273)"},{"Id":"2718922434","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-05T00:05:33","Actor":"arunchndr","Number":"76271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Codeql suppression in SemanticSearchToolWindowImpl","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76271","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Codeql suppression in SemanticSearchToolWindowImpl\" (#76271)"},{"Id":"2718844987","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-04T23:07:00","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"76270","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update filenames in file banners when moving a type to a new file.","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/74703","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76270","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update filenames in file banners when moving a type to a new file.\" (#76270)"},{"Id":"2718511282","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-04T18:31:10","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"76269","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update regex messages","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76269","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update regex messages\" (#76269)"},{"Id":"2718356607","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-04T17:15:39","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"76268","RawContent":null,"Title":"Area - Convert Local Function to Method","State":"open","Body":"Parent issue tracking the \"Convert Local Function to Method\" area.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76268","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Area - Convert Local Function to Method\" (#76268)"},{"Id":"2718349731","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-04T17:12:30","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"76267","RawContent":null,"Title":"Area - String Copy/Paste","State":"open","Body":"Parent issue for the \"String Copy/Paste\" area.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76267","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Area - String Copy/Paste\" (#76267)"},{"Id":"2718332265","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-04T17:03:54","Actor":"jtschuster","Number":"76266","RawContent":null,"Title":"Interceptors suppress analyzer warnings when location is the entire `InvocationExpressionSyntax`, but not when location is `InvocationExpressionSyntax.Expression`","State":"open","Body":"Version 4.13.0-2.24570.4\n\nIn the ILLink analyzer, we provide warnings on the entire invocation syntax, but for `RequiresX` warnings, it makes more sense to warn only on the reference to the method. https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/110086 changes these warning to be on the `InvocationExpressionSyntax.Expression` rather than the entire `InvocationExpressionSyntax`, but it causes new warnings to appear on invocations that have been intercepted to call non-warnings methods.

Most of the time they fail with OutOfMemory exceptions, sometimes segmentation faults. Before the build the machine is using 1.25 out of 8 GB RAM during the build it goes up to about 1.58 GB when looking at with htop, so whatever peaks OOM must be doing a huge allocation. Its a virtual ubuntu machine with no swap configured for performance. (This was preconfigured either by the VM hosting company or the ubuntu installation image and not configured by me so I assume its a common setup.)\n\nCommand line to publish is `dotnet publish server -c Release -f net9.0 -r linux-x64 --self-contained false -o /game/bin`\n\nWe had no issues building the same codebase in .NET 8, first few builds on .NET 9 were fine too, before it suddenly started to regularly fail with OOM.

The asset manifest that gets produced in a BuildPass>2 build contains all the assets from the previous dependent vertical manifests. This is undesirable in general but also causes an issue when we merge all manifests together because there are duplicates that can't be resolved.\r\n\r\n2. Artifacts from the dependent verticals get uploaded to the \"<JobName>_Artifacts\" pipeline artifact in CI in addition to the new artifacts produced which is a waste of resources. It also makes it harder to differentiate what actually got produced in the BuildPass>1 leg.\r\n\r\n3. The log that lists all the artifacts that got produced by the repo build also outputs the artifacts from the dependent verticals because their manifests were considered as well.\r\n\r\n4. Repo asset manifests from dependent verticals have the same name and therefore got ignored. Only the first one gets copied, all the other repo asset manifest files are ignored.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIsolate the asset manifests that get produced by the build and then later read to generated the merged (vertical) manifest, from the downloaded dependent vertical manifests. Upload the vertical manifest only, instead of all the inner repo manifests. Name the manifest based on the job name to avoid conflicts.\r\n\r\nDon't upload everything under artifacts/assets and artifacts/packages. Instead read from the current vertical merged manifest to identify the assets to upload. Leverage an msbuild project for this that prepares the directory to upload. As part of that, also introduce a YML configuration property that defaults to Release and pass that into the build to be able to find the path to the vertical manifest without hardcoding a certain configuration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45323","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix BuildPass>1 artifacts and asset manifest content\" (#45323)"},{"Id":"2719783326","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-05T08:56:49","Actor":"mariam-abdulla","Number":"45322","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add mstest dependency","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45322","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add mstest dependency\" (#45322)"},{"Id":"2719719367","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-05T08:25:58","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"45321","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0.2xx] [dotnet-format] Include the .NET Framework buildhost executable in the SDK.","State":"open","Body":"Backport of #45290 to release/9.0.2xx\n\n/cc @JoeRobich","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45321","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/9.0.2xx] [dotnet-format] Include the .NET Framework buildhost executable in the SDK.\" (#45321)"},{"Id":"2719207813","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-05T07:29:39","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"45319","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 20241204.10\r\n- **Date Produced**: December 5, 2024 2:54:11 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 66fe036f1e4f11e39953cb281e39162b37fa4d7d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe `CopyWithPrivateKey` methods that combine a certificate with its associated private key fail on macOS 15 when using in-memory (ephemeral) keys.  This failure is most commonly seen when creating new certificates via `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` or when loading a certificate and key from a PEM file (or files) with `X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem`, which utilize the affected methods.\r\n\r\nCallers of these methods on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\") will receive a `CryptographicException`, specifically `Interop+AppleCrypto+AppleCommonCryptoCryptographicException: The specified item is no longer valid. It may have been deleted from the keychain.`  The `dotnet dev-certs https` command relies on `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` and fails with this error.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects .NET 6, .NET 8, and .NET 9. The issue is addressed in the upcoming .NET 6.0.34, .NET 8.0.10, and 9.0.0-rc2 releases, scheduled for release in October 2024.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nmacOS 15 uses a different status code to indicate a key is not in a Keychain than prior versions do.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have not already upgraded to macOS 15 from a prior version and use .NET, you are not impacted by this issue.  If you are planning to upgrade to macOS 15, the workaround is to upgrade to .NET 6.0.34. .NET 8.0.10, or .NET 9.0.0-rc2 (scheduled for October 2024) prior to upgrading to macOS 15.\r\n\r\nLoading a certificate and its associated private key from a PKCS#12/PFX are not affected.  If you are using an application that supports loading a certificate (and associated private key) by either PFX or PEM, converting your PEM contents to PFX - and updating configuration appropriately - may unblock you.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/324","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Certificate Issues on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\")\" (#324)"},{"Id":"2517880984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T21:26:30","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"323","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 RC 1","State":"open","Body":"# Announcement\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Release Candidate 1.\r\n\r\nThis release contains the following improvements:\r\n\r\n## **📚Libraries**\r\n\r\n* [WebSocket `Keep-Alive` Ping and Timeout APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#websocket-keep-alive-ping-and-timeout)\r\n* [Add ZLib, Brotli compression options](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-zlib-and-brotli-compression-options)\r\n* [Add TarEntry.DataOffset](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-tarentrydataoffset)\r\n* [`HttpClientFactory` no longer logs header values by default](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#httpclientfactory-no-longer-logs-header-values-by-default)\r\n* [Out-of-proc Meter wildcard listening](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#Out-of-proc-Meter-wildcard-listening)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md)\r\n\r\n## **🛠️ SDK**\r\n\r\n* [Workload History](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md#workload-history)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md)\r\n\r\n## **🌐 ASP.NET Core**\r\n\r\n* [Improvements to SignalR distributed tracing](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#improvements-to-signalr-distributed-tracing)\r\n* [Keep-alive timeout for WebSockets](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keep-alive-timeout-for-websockets)\r\n* [Keyed DI in middleware](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keyed-di-in-middleware)\r\n* [Override `InputNumber` type attribute](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#override-inputnumber-type-attribute)\r\n* [Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-linux)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md)\r\n\r\n## **📱 .NET MAUI**\r\n\r\n* [Added `HorizontalTextAlignment.Justify`](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md#added-horizontaltextalignmentjustify)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md)\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\nTo get started with .NET 9, [install the .NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).\r\n\r\nIf you're on Windows using Visual Studio, we recommend installing the latest [Visual Studio 2022 preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/). .NET 9 is now can be installed directly through the Visual Studio installer starting with Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Visual Studio Code and the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension with .NET 9.\r\n\r\nYou can find [.NET 9 RC 1 Installer & Binaries](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/9.0.0-rc.1.md) on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Team Announcements & Discussions\r\n\r\nDiscuss this release with the product teams on GitHub through the announcements for this release.\r\n\r\n* [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/discussions/24698)\r\n* ASP.NET Core(https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/discussions/57787)\r\n\r\n## Stay up-to-date with .NET 9\r\n\r\nYou can stay up-to-date with all the features of .NET 9 with:\r\n\r\n* [What's new in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview)\r\n* [What's new in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0)\r\n* [What's new in .NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/whats-new/dotnet-9)\r\n* [What's new in EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew)\r\n* [Breaking Changes in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/9.0)\r\n* [.NET 9 Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/README.md)\r\n\r\nFor .NET 9 previews we are utilizing GitHub Discussions to make announcements.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nWe [announced Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/) in the first half of 2019 and [shipped the first stable](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-1-0/ba-p/825859) package later that year. That release [coincided with .NET Core 3.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/#introducing-the-new-sqlclient). We’ve been developing [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) in the [dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient) repo since that time, over the last five years. It’s now time to start the deprecation process for the [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) package. We plan to take a staged process to deprecation, with the intent to align support changes and associated code transition activities between these libraries to natural migration points between .NET major versions.\r\n\r\nAll System.Data.SqlClient users are encouraged to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. We offer improvements and significantly higher support via the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nWe intend to deprecate the System.Data.SqlClient package in stages.\r\n- **Before .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - Publish a new 5.0.0 package, including the following changes.\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 7 and earlier and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and earlier.\r\n  - Publish assets for the following target frameworks: .NET 8, .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n  - Add [Obsolete attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#obsolete-attribute) to .NET 8 and .NET Standard 2.0 assets. This will generate new warnings for .NET 8+ and .NET Standard users.\r\n  - Continue to offer security servicing, for .NET 8, and .NET Framework 4.6.2+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - No change\r\n  - We will not support this package for .NET 9+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 8 EOL:**\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 8 users (the .NET 8 library will be removed).\r\n  - Maintain support for .NET Framework 4.6.2+ users.\r\n  - Security servicing will be provided via .NET Framework, not the package, at that point.\r\n  - We do not expect to update the package again after this point.\r\n  - We will not mark the package as deprecated since it will only support .NET Framework users with an implementation provided by .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nWe will remove support in the package for unsupported .NET and .NET Framework versions at various stages of this deprecation plan. Users affected by those changes are encouraged to move to a supported .NET or .NET Framework version and to adopt the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove support for .NET 6 since it will go EOL shortly after this new package is released, even though .NET 6 will still be supported at the time. Publishing a .NET 8 library significantly simplifies the plan, both in terms of what we will deliver and what we need to explain.\r\n\r\nFor .NET dates, see [.NET Releases.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) .NET 9 will [GA in November](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) of this year. .NET 8 will go EOL in November, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe current package version of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) is 4.8.6, at the time of writing. These changes will be made with a 5.0.0 version and later.\r\n\r\n**Note:** _This deprecation doesn’t apply to the System.Data.SqlClient namespace in .NET Framework._\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n\r\nDaily downloads of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient on nuget.org are nearing 50% higher than System.Data.SqlClient. We expect the gap in usage between the two libraries will continue to increase. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is the best library we offer to access SQL Server.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing high-quality, performance-driven, and secure data access technologies. We strongly encourage users to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. It is actively maintained and supports the latest SQL Server features.\r\n\r\n### How to migrate? \r\n\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project, then update your references and using statements. Our [porting cheat sheet](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/blob/master/porting-cheat-sheet.md) provides a step-by-step set of changes you may need to make.\r\n\r\n1. **Update your project references:** Replace references to System.Data.SqlClient with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n2. **Modify your using statements:** Update your using statements in your code files from System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n3. **Test your application:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected after the migration.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to [support semi-automatic migration](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/issues/1593) via [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant).\r\n\r\n**Support & Feedback:** If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please reach out through our [official support channels](https://support.microsoft.com/) or join the discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues).\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions - dotnet/SqlClient Wiki - GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\n- [Introduction to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16)\r\n- [SQL Server and ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql)\r\n- [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcement: System.Data.SqlClient package is now deprecated\" (#322)"},{"Id":"2464032272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T19:08:47","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"321","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 Preview 7","State":"open","Body":"We are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Preview 7.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs [announced earlier](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293), starting with .NET 9, we no longer include an implementation of `BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (.NET Framework remains unchanged). The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type. Hence, setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient to use `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n* We published the [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide]. We'd appreciate if could give it a read and give us feedback by filling issues in the [dotnet/docs] repo.\r\n* If you experience issues related to BinaryFormatter's removal not addressed in this migration guide, please file an issue in the [dotnet/runtime][dotnet/runtime] repo and indicate that the issue is related to the removal of `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Why was it removed?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][security-guide]*\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that BinaryFormatter is unsafe. Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is a common weakness enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue: [CWE-502 \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"][CWE502]. `BinaryFormatter` is such a deserializer. We also cover this in the [BinaryFormatter security guide][security-guide].\r\n\r\n### What are my options to move forward?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][migration-guide]*\r\n\r\nYou have two options to address the removal of `BinaryFormatter`'s implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Migrate away from BinaryFormatter**. We strongly recommend you to investigate options to stop using `BinaryFormatter` due to the associated security risks. The [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide] lists several options.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep using BinaryFormatter**. If you need to continue using `BinaryFormatter` in .NET 9, you need to depend on the unsupported [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters][compat-pack] NuGet package, which restores the unsafe legacy functionality and replaces the throwing implementation.\r\n\r\n[compat-pack]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package\r\n[migration-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/\r\n[security-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide\r\n[CWE502]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\r\n[dotnet/docs]: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-general-issue.yml\r\n[dotnet/runtime]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/new\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106240.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n\r\n Version:   8.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 8.0.3\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.7  Runtime or .NET 8.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.32 or SDK 6.0.132 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0 and .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty.

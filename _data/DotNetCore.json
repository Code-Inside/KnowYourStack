This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present.

It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and given few have hit this and it does impact that scenario the fix to follow the COM rules is warranted."},{"Id":"13076993016","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-31T20:04:51","Actor":"sdmaclea","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28072","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()\" (#28072) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present. As .NET 5 releases and adoption increases the assumption would be this issue will become more common.\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/38950 for user reported issue.\r\n\r\n.NET 5 PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40228.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from .NET Framework and has been present since COM support was added to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidation of the above user scenario and updated tests in .NET 5 to verify the scenario. The test updates did not get ported to this PR but can be if those changes are desired. The minimum updates to tests were applied here to enable build and run of existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThe risk of this change has two facets. It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28073","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[.NET Core 3.1] Don't rely on the built-in interface marshaller during COM activation.\" (#28073)"},{"Id":"670175635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-31T20:04:50","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()","State":"open","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

Since the CTR already knows with what token it's associated, allowing you to get the token from the CTR saves you from also needing to separately store the token, which lets you improve memory utilization by not carrying it around effectively twice.  We took advantage of that, for example, in FileStream's Read/WriteAsync operations, to decrease the size of the object allocated for those operations.  However, the CTR.Token property is incorrectly throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed, which introduces an ODE where there wasn't previously one (just accessing a CancellationToken you already had stored).  This is causing regressions in code that created a token source, registered with its token, and then disposed the source.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nExceptions on background threads that crash the process when performing operations like:\r\n```C#\r\nvar cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\nTask<int> t = fileStream.ReadAsync(..., cts.Token);\r\ncts.Dispose();\r\nint result = await t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe fixed this in 2.2 but so far held off on backporting to 2.1 pending more customer data since it's an LTS release. Since then we've had 2 more reports (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37641) most recently a customer that says:\r\n\r\n> It may take the rest of the year to reach 3.1. In the meantime our servers are crashing and clients are getting mad! I can only apologize to them, mitigate the issues as best as possible and then blame you for not updating an LTS version!\r\n\r\nSince the change is very low risk -- it's been in the product since 2.2 -- we are proposing we now backport to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes.  It's not a regression in CancellationTokenRegistration.Token, which was only introduced in 2.1, but rather a regression in that it's behavior isn't matching code it was used to replace, so it's for example a regression in FileStream.Read/WriteAsync.\r\n\r\n#### Packaging reviewed? \r\n\r\nChange affects System.Private.CoreLib only.\r\n\r\n#### Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

This would severely degrade the UX for usage of function pointers though.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo. This is supporting a new C# feature and previous .NET runtimes never tested/supported this scenario.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidated both 32 and 64 bit struct of the field marshalling scenario.

Such filesystem pollution can be a problem. If you are running on Windows a quite severe problem, since NTFS... well, let's not go there, you all know (or should know) how bad that is.\n\nSince there's approximately zero percent chance Microsoft would ever (be able to, even if it wanted, which it don't) implement fast hierarchical filesystem-mounting support, with filesystems optimized for various kinds of payloads, that is a dead end.\n\nA fully user-mode and portable way to handle this problem could be to add read-only VFS support for msbuild/dotnet/VS. While researching this idea, I came across two different implementations for VSCode, so it's clearly not an unwanted feature.\n\nWhile zip is inferior in just about every concievable way to other archive formats, it can be created and handled by tools on just about any operating system on the planet. It'd also still be far superior to general filesystem (such as, and especially, NTFS) for these scenarios, with the added benefit .NET already contains all the code to handle zip archives.\n\nIf you use the archive format only, without compression (a.k.a. -z0), you get multiple benefits from such a design, while still allowing such archives to reside in \"chunking\" SCM's (such as git) where they can be updated without incurring the otherwise massive size-explosion you could experience with compressed archives (where each revision would effectively become a whole new BLOB).\n\nSuch a design would reduce resource consumption on multiple levels, meaning less wasted RAM, disk, CPU, electricity, and in the end money.\n\n- Memory pressure. For the curious at Microsoft, ask anyone on the Cc team how well it handles a million small files, or how large the allocation granularity is for cache data, or someone on the Ob team how much the overhead would be if trying to open a million files.\n\n- Cache- and CPU-friendly. NT's Cc obviously works better with a large data stream than a million small ones. Since the data is uncompressed, there's no decompression-overhead on read.\n\n- CPU. No more round-trips to kmode and back to open a file, or iterate files. This benefit becomes even larger if you are using an Intel CPU, where the Meltdown and Spectre mitigations are in effect; I have seen figures as large as 60% performance hit due to Intel's cheating.\n\n- Disk space. The disk space savings can be significant, and that's without even mentioning how much fragmentation can be reduced (again, for the curious, ask someone on the NTFS team and see them uneasily study their shoes while trying to downplay the impact).\n\n- OS file handles. There would be exactly one file handle per consumer to the archive containing such a collection of files. This translates to increase in speed, and reduction of OS resource consumption.\n\n- MSBuild dependency checking. It could f.ex. know (with 100% certainty) that any file within such an archive is unmodified while the archive is open (or even the archive date is unmodified); all files within such an archive would effectively be one single lookup, instead of one million lookups (and a minimum of one million context switches).\n\n- Roslyn speedups. This could allow for **massive** optimization for Roslyn, if it gets support to recognize such read-only mounted source trees. It could f.ex. replace the file references (currently stored as UCS-2 string representations of GUID's, I believe, i.e. a minimum of 66 bytes instead of 16 -- each) with a single DWORD containing archive # and file index #.\n\nPlease note that this could benefit not only Microsoft's customers, but also Microsoft's own developers and therefore Microsoft itself.\n\nAnyway, you now have the idea. Do with as you please.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 8/6/2020, 00:57 AM: \n\nThank you for taking the time to provide your suggestion.&nbsp; We will do some preliminary checks to make sure we can proceed further.&nbsp; We'll provide an update once the issue has been triaged by the product team.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/46635","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"VS, build system and Roslyn (Zip) read-only VFS support for C #\" (#46635)"},{"Id":"675190769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-07T18:24:19","Actor":"jnm2","Number":"46634","RawContent":null,"Title":" Stop emitting ModuleInitializerAttribute as a custom attribute since it has no runtime meaning","State":"open","Body":"The presence of ModuleInitializerAttribute as a custom attribute in the metadata doesn't make sense for the same reason that MethodImplAttribute/SerializerAttribute/IndexerNameAttribute wouldn't make sense in the metadata.

But, not very functional for collapsing stuff. If you toggle and collapse, since it's recursive,  you'll end up as in the following state (Picture1). Quite frankly, I don't know how the community organizes their code, but in my case I almost never want to see my code in this state.<br><br>I'd suggest the following option:<br>- Expand-collapse for attributes (available in Tweaks extension): this option should expand/collapse only the attributes (Picture2)<br>- Expand-collapse for regions: this should work only for the region (Picture3)<br><br>If we want more general rule of this, that probably might be : collapse everything recursively inside class content. I can't find a case where this might cause issues for the community! But, once again, the community might have different preferences.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Fati Iseni</p><p><a href=\"https://developercommunityapi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/storage/attachments/149234-picture1.png\"> Image:149234-picture1.png</a></p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://developercommunityapi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/storage/attachments/149231-picture2.png\"> Image:149231-picture2.png</a></p><p><a href=\"https://developercommunityapi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/storage/attachments/149232-picture3.png\"> Image:149232-picture3.png</a></p>\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 8/3/2020, 03:19 AM: \n\nThank you for taking the time to provide your suggestion.&nbsp; We will do some preliminary checks to make sure we can proceed further.&nbsp; We'll provide an update once the issue has been triaged by the product team.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/46632","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Additional outlining options\" (#46632)"},{"Id":"675186824","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-07T18:15:58","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"46631","RawContent":null,"Title":"Suggest to import namespaces for generated event handlers","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/idea/1118141/suggest-to-import-namespaces-for-generated-event-h.html)._\n\n---\n<p>When I write the code to attach an event handler, VS suggests to generate a new method.

There are inevitably going to end up confusing people, and I can already see the flood of questions on the C# discord about \"Why does the && not do what I told it to do here?\". Some examples where this can fall down:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nswitch ((bool?)false)\r\n{\r\n    case true || false: break; // Does not handle false, because false || true is a constant expression!\r\n\tcase null: break;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (o is 1 || true) {} // Always enters this if\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should consider having a rule to flag these types of suspect cases and offer to rewrite them using `or` patterns, much like we do for `!is` today. The basic rules for such an analyzer (I think) have 2 forms:\r\n\r\nForm 1: Pattern expressions\r\n\r\nThese are things inside a pattern, such as in a case block or nested inside some other pattern. This is the much simpler case:\r\n1. If you encounter a `||`, offer to change it to an `or`. If you encounter an `&&`, offer to change it to an `and`.\r\n\r\nInside a pattern, this can almost never go wrong, as everything has to be constant, or the compiler will error anyway. There are cases when you could legitimately use `||` and `&&` inside a pattern (if, say, you were composing a single boolean check out of multiple `#if`-set flags), but these cases are few, far between, confusing to the reader, and I would argue should have a warning suppression.\r\n\r\nForm 2: Trailing `is` expression constants\r\n\r\nThese are much harder to detect and implement, and false positives are much more likely, but I think at least offering an `info` diagnostic and a refactoring would be useful. A implementation of this rule might be:\r\n\r\n1. See an `is` expression.\r\n2. Walk to the next node past the pattern (and trivia) of the expression. If that is not a logical operator (either `&&` or `||`), goto step 5.\r\n3. Walk to the next sub-expression, the expression on the right of this logical operator.\r\n4. Check the constant value of this expression. If there is no constant value, goto step 5. If there is, add the expression to a list of constants to add to the pattern, and whether it was an `and` or an `or`. Go to step 2.\r\n5. If no constants were found, end. Otherwise, gather the list of constants and their conjunctions, and rewrite the pattern use `and`s and `or`s instead of `&&` and `||`.\r\n\r\nFinally, we should consider having a refactoring going the other direction, particularly for non-constants. For example, if I write `if (a is nonConstant1 or nonConstant2)`, I'd get an error. A refactoring to convert that to `if (a == nonConstant1 || a == nonConstant2)` would be useful. For this idea, also consider saving `a` to a temp if it's something like a method call, as that's what the pattern form will do. Perhaps offer 2 refactorings, one that will save and one that will not.\r\n\r\nBoth of these refactorings might change the semantics of the code, so it's important to call that out. But I believe that new users will end up being confused by the different syntaxes here, and we should try to help them.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/46637","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"C# 9 Analyzer: Flag suspect pattern usages\" (#46637)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CoreRT-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"675591803","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-08T21:35:56","Actor":"yowl","Number":"8259","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wasm: add support for overflow checks on unsigned ints","State":"open","Body":"This PR add supports and a couple of tests for overflow checks on unsigned int32s and int64s.

The Team had it already running with Mono but was not satisfied with the overall performances. Therefore I was tasked with checking if the performances can be improved or finding an alternative to using Mono. \r\n\r\nAs getting CoreRT working on the XBox was an very easy task I was able to get the core module of our C# code run in a few hours. As it runs more than twice as fast compared to Mono it was decided to go ahead. PlayStation was a little bit more work but it worked after a few days and showed the same performances improvements. Unfortunately while goingon to the Switch I noticed that the ARM64 support was incomplete and using ARM was not an option because of some limitations on the target system. As the team still wanted the performances improvements I started to implement the missing parts. It took some time but I was able to get our test case running and again it was more than twice as fast as the Mono version. It does not use all .Net features therefore there are still parts missing. But as our test test case (around 5MB of C# code) was able to run for hours with the precise GC I assume it is at least a big part.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately priorities changed and this project was put on hold. After things have changed again it was decided to give a switch from Mono to CoreRT a second try. This time I although got the permission to submit anything that does not touch the various NDAs. As you might assume I needed to add code on different places including the jit itself. As anything was done on a now nearly one year old version I need to reintegrate all these changes again. But I'd like to make sure they can easily go back in the main code branch. \r\n\r\nTherefore the question on which of these changes you are interested in and what's your recommended work flow?\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8236","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ARM64 and cross compile support\" (#8236)"},{"Id":"658291999","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-16T15:29:50","Actor":"ogxd","Number":"8234","RawContent":null,"Title":"Link error 1181 when building the NativeLibrary sample as a shared library","State":"closed","Body":"I just cloned the repository.\r\n\r\nThe C# dll builds fine, but then when I try to compile it as a shared library using : \r\n`dotnet publish /p:NativeLib=Shared -r win-x64 -c Release`\r\n\r\nIt throws the following exception : \r\n`LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'kernel32.lib' [...\\corert\\samples\\NativeLibrary\\NativeLibrary.csproj]\r\n...\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.dotnet.ilcompiler\\1.0.0-alpha-29116-02\\build\\Microsoft.NETCore.Native.targets(310,5): error MSB3073: The command \"link  @\"obj\\Release\\netstandard2.0\\win-x64\\native\\link.rsp\"\" exited with code 1181.

(For a full context of why we need that, please refer to the gitter conversation, or feel free to contact me directly)\r\n\r\nThanks to all the great work that's already been done via LLVM for wasm, perhaps the project wouldn't be as crazy as I immediately think.\r\n\r\nWith help from @MichalStrehovsky and @yowl, and based on Michal's zerosharp code, I got a tiny little no-corelib Hello world to compile via LLVM an x86 Mac executable:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corert/compare/master...christianscheuer:macllvm\r\n\r\nTo test it, make sure to install the prerequisites (it needs llvm 10.0 and the MacOS 10.13 SDK installed, see the README for more info), then build CoreRT in Debug and skip the tests: `./build.sh skiptests`, then go into the `tests/src/llvm` directory and run `./build.sh`.\r\nIt will run CSC to compile to IL, run the modified ILC from the repo to compile to bitcode (which uses the WebAssembly LLVM backend with some hardcoded modifications) - and then use the installed LLVM 10 linker (it needs to be the same major version of LLVM that's used to produce the bitcode, and we're using libLLVM 10 to produce the bitcode) to produce a runnable executable. It then runs it, it prints Hello world and returns 42 :)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow all of this raises a bunch of questions it would be great to get your input to.\r\n\r\n- Assuming that we would be going down this path, I expect the first step would be to look at how to refactor the WebAssembly backend so that a new, generic ILToLLVMImporter can be created as a base class, and have ILToWebAssemblyImporter inherit from that, as well as other derived classes for the new x86, x64, arm64 targets (or, some other structure). For example, I suspect many opcode importers, stack management etc. should be the same no matter if the \"architecture\" is wasm or x64 (accounting for different pointer sizes), so there should be a lot of code that can be reused. Things like the shadow stack however I don't think we'll need for anything but wasm, if I understand the reasons behind it correctly, so there would be a challenge to see how to structure the code so both a shadow stack based and regular stack based version can coexist.\r\nSo the question is - with all of this in mind: How would you approach code structuring of such an endeavor?\r\nObviously we can do a clean copy-paste into a different directory, but I thought the two implementations could benefit from each other if they were linked...\r\n\r\n- Overall engineering plan\r\nWhat would be the best way to approach the rest of the bringup, once that initial refactor has been done? What would be the best order of x64-ifying it (ie. add support for 8 byte pointer sizes, potentially remove the shadow stack, etc.)\r\nAny other considerations?\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8230","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Investigating LLVM as a general backend for x86, x64 and arm64 code generation\" (#8230)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"SDK-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"675756728","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-10T05:23:24","Actor":"rekaerst","Number":"12841","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET core sdk is still SPYING it's users even after it's \"disabled\" by \"DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1\" environment variable","State":"closed","Body":"My dotnet sdk is extremely slow on creating new projects, so I dug a little on this abnormal behavior, and then I found that dotnet is making a lot of network requests.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- .NET SDK 5.0.202 -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- .NET 6 Preview 3 -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions."},{"Id":"15752631045","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git."},{"Id":"15626592773","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-21T13:01:45","Actor":"Nirmal4G","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git."},{"Id":"15469684782","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:01:30","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/178","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\" (#178) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 2.1.

The change can have harmless non-test effects, for example a default interface method may be jitted redundantly fewer times after the change (as expected), since before the change the call to `GetNativeCode()` here would always return null for a default interface method and the method may be jitted again unnecessarily.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/867aa5e1141c8801796a80171a3749d944c6b9af/src/vm/codeversion.cpp#L2304-L2309\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the main purpose of the port is to fix some GCStress tests to make CI runs more reliable and useful for testing other fixes made to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n@echesakovMSFT has verified that all related GCStress failures are fixed after the change on Windows arm64 where the issues were seen.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- The change has been in all of the 5.0 releases\r\n- The change makes tracking of the native code for default interface methods similar to other methods that have a precode and don't have a stable entry point, so the behavior would be more consistent with other types of methods\r\n- The native code slot for default interface methods is a pointer-size extra memory per such method, it wouldn't be significant as the number of such methods is typically low compared to other types of methods, and most other methods already use a native code slot","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[3.1] Use native code slot for default interface methods (#25770)\" (#28153)"},{"Id":"807495713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-10T12:31:00","Actor":"briansull","Number":"28146","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backport the fix for dotnet/runtime issue 46529","State":"closed","Body":"5.0.x version of this change: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47741\r\n\r\n### Incorrect behavior a 64-bit long with shift of 32 or more combined with a cast to int \r\n\r\nThe JIT generates incorrect code for this code pattern:\r\n\r\n`(int) (X << C)`\r\n\r\nwhere C >= 32 and\r\nand  X is anything with a potential side-effect and is 64-bit integer type\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReported by customer who was migrating to .Net Core from the Desktop runtime.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis is a regression that was introduced in the .Net 3.X timeframe by \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/19899\r\n\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\nFixes issue #47724","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28146","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backport the fix for dotnet/runtime issue 46529\" (#28146)"},{"Id":"809951727","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-10T12:26:40","Actor":"davmason","Number":"28148","RawContent":null,"Title":"GCStress eventing fix","State":"closed","Body":"Port #26776 to 3.1. \r\n\r\nEventPipe had an issue where it would see a reentrant stackwalk during GCStress, which triggers asserts on checked or debug builds.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nHaving tests fail under GCStress means we are less confident when preparing fixes for 3.1.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"705166145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-20T19:05:41","Actor":"Korporal","Number":"1775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confusing behavior when using AssemblyInfo.cs ","State":"open","Body":"I'm completely perplexed.\r\n\r\nI created a .Net Standard 2.0 library project.\r\n\r\nI explicity added an AssemblyInfo.cs file, we need this because we use this utility to \"stamp\" our assemblies when we build them:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ygoe/NetRevisionTool\r\n\r\nThat utility is run as a pre/post build event and temporarily replaces placeholders in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute with runtime values (like repo folder name, commit ID, branch etc etc).\r\n\r\nThe completed assembly then has this info \"burned\" into it as we go forward.\r\n\r\n.Net Standard is not working with this.\r\n\r\n1.

multi-targetting projects","State":"open","Body":"PR should be reviewed with whitespace changes off.\r\n\r\nCurrently our Find-Refs UI can be pretty unpleasant when dealing with multi-targetting projects.  As roslyn internally represents tehse as separate projects, with their own separate references to linked files, you end up with situations like the following:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/114626279-56b27580-9c68-11eb-8bc5-5af577474e11.png)\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of duplication here that makes it hard to navigate and get to the locations you care about.  First, the symbol itself is duplicated since it is defined in a file linked into two separate project contexts.  We view each of these symbols as unique (as each may have distinct references).  We then have the references per symbol.  Again, there is a lot of duplication here as several (though not all) of the references appear for both views of the symbol.\r\n\r\nWe recently improved a similar problem for navigate-to here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/50128\r\n\r\nIn that PR we changed it so that we merge effectively equivalent results, just adding more information to the display showing that the merged item comes from multiple locations.  Like so:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/114626660-e35d3380-9c68-11eb-909e-86ac6346d59d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR brings a similar concept to FindRefs, merging both definitions that are effectively equivalent, as well as references.  Looking at the scenario above, this reduces the UI down to:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/114626734-f8d25d80-9c68-11eb-9393-956d6686edba.png)\r\n\r\nThis is already a lot better.  We can see that there's effectively one definition (albeit for several project flavors), and tehre are only 5 references (though three of them come from a multi-flavored location).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/52618","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Improve the Find-References UI for multi-targetting projects\" (#52618)"},{"Id":"857341153","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-13T21:36:05","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"52617","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge 'features/compiler' into 'features/GlobalUsingDirective'","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/52617","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge 'features/compiler' into 'features/GlobalUsingDirective'\" (#52617)"},{"Id":"857322250","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-13T21:06:40","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"52616","RawContent":null,"Title":"Handle 'is' operators and patterns in definite assignment","State":"open","Body":"Related to #51463\r\n\r\nImplements the following section of the spec: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/improved-definite-assignment.md#is-operator-and-is-pattern-expressions","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/52616","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Handle 'is' operators and patterns in definite assignment\" (#52616)"},{"Id":"857320919","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-13T21:04:33","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"52615","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge main to main-vs-deps","State":"open","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from main into main-vs-deps.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main-vs-deps\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

This interface was always internal, which of course meant that any host (like Visual Studio for Mac) that wasn't directly in the Roslyn codebase had to have InternalsVisibleTo access.\r\n\r\nThis abstraction was so good, in the intervening years the VS platform needed a similar concept, and so the platform introduced IUIThreadOperationExecutor, which was their name for basically the same thing. But unlike ours (which was internal), theirs is public, and already has implementations for our hosts. And anybody wanting to host Roslyn already will have to define the editor version, so having to also force hosts to define a second implementation is a waste of everybody's time. Specifically this often creates a lot of confusion around creating MEF containers when it's just not necessary anymore.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm moving Roslyn off of our internal interface but leaving the implementation there; that's because we have some other users via InternalsVisibleTo that are still using this directly. The methods and types are now marked as Obsolete, and the users can simply migrate to the editor APIs like we are too.\r\n\r\nThere is one extra thing our implementation also did which the platform one won't, and that's talk to our global operation service which is potentially used to pause long-running operations when there is a user-blocking operation active. I'm skeptical that is providing much value, because when we migrated to the editor's command handling, we migrated most of our uses of IWaitIndicator to use the platform provided context, and it seems everything was fine.\r\n\r\nAs a small note, our implementation of IWaitIndicator also implemented a second copy of the interface that's defined in\r\nMicrosoft.VtsualStudio.Text.Internal. I believe the editor has wanted us to stop doing that for a long time since they couldn't delete those types, even if they themselves had stopped using it.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/52597","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Delete IWaitIndicator in favor of the public platform types\" (#52597)"},{"Id":"856525930","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-13T03:13:16","Actor":"XiaoYaoHui","Number":"52596","RawContent":null,"Title":"Roslyn plugin does not work for vs2019 16.3.2","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: VS2019 16.3.2\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1.

x64] coexistence","State":"open","Body":"[Microsoft](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/) are both producing new OSes for Arm64 that support x64 emulation. For .NET, we need to determine how to support .NET Arm64 and x64 builds on those OSes in a way that offers a reasonable user experience and that has reasonable cost.\r\n\r\n## Problem to solve\r\n\r\nAs stated, we need to offer x64 and Arm64 builds of .NET within one 64-bit namespace (without much help from the OS on how to manage it). That leads to three issues:\r\n\r\n- How do we separate the products in some directory structure (peer directories or unified)?\r\n- Do customers manage using the arm64 vs arm64 product via which one is in the path (or absolute paths to dotnet)?\r\n- Do the directory names represent the product in the way we want?\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nThe Windows and macOS plans and implementations are similar but have key differences, per our understanding.\r\n\r\n\t- Same: No WoW64 subsystem or Program Files (x64) style experience. For example, there is no x64 command prompt.\r\n\t- Same: An executable can be universal.\r\n\t- Different: macOS universal executables are transparently restartable, while Windows ones are not.\r\n\t- Different: Windows x64 emulation is here to stay, while macOS x64 emulation will probably be removed in 3-5 years.\r\n\r\nThe following are various high-level solutions that we could employ, with pros and cons.\r\n\r\n## Status quo\r\n\r\nOn Windows x64, .NET is installed to two locations (depending on architecture):\r\n\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\r\n\r\nToday, customers need one of those two directories in the path in order to get the \"dotnet\" experience they want, like if they want a 32-bit or 64-bit \"dotnet build\".\r\n\r\nNote: There will not be a C:\\Program Files (x64) directory on Windows Arm64. We are expected to install 64-bit products (Intel and/or Arm based) in C:\\Program Files.\r\n\r\nOn macOS, .NET is installed to one location:\r\n\r\n\t- /usr/local/share/dotnet \r\n\r\n## Going forward\r\nThere will be one dotnet in the path, just like today. Much like the 32- and 64-bit support we offer on Windows, we'll offer both Arm64 and x64 builds of .NET and customers can install both or either, and can control which is in the `PATH`. That will determine if they get an Arm64 or x64 dotnet build. We are not planning on building a .NET version manager that enables switching which architecture you get. We intend to rely on the `PATH`.\r\n\r\nThe question is what structure we offer for the two 64-bit products, how intuitive that is (now and later) and how expensive that is for us to offer.\r\n\r\n### Native dotnet\r\n\r\nPremise: there is a \"dotnet\" directory on every OS, and it is the native architecture.\r\n\r\nWe'd end up with the following, on Windows and macOS, respectively:\r\n\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet_x64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet \r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet_x64\r\n\r\nThis is the usual \"who gets the good name\" problem. \r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- The dotnet directory is the native architecture on all Oses.\r\n- This option is particularly beneficial for macOS, since we expect x64 emulation to be taken away relatively quickly, at which point dotnet_x64 would disappear on that OS.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n- x64 directories on x64 and Arm64 machines no longer match.\r\n- x64 installers needs to change, including for 3.1 and 5.0. Hopefully, a single install can install to dotnet on an x64 machine and dotnet_x64 on an Arm64 machine. If not, we need a second set of x64 installers. That's likely untenable.\r\n- We have to break, migrate or somehow manage existing x64 .NET installs on Apple Silicon machines.\r\n\r\n### Archify dotnet\r\n\r\nPremise: fully embrace multi-arch support, with arch-specific directories.\r\n\r\nWe'd end up with the following:\r\n\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet_arm64\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet_x64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet _arm64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet _x64\r\n\r\nOn Arm64, we'd have these arch-specific directories. This is the \"no one gets the good name option; everybody loses\" option.\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- The directories are all self-descriptive and symmetrical.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n- Same cons as \"Native dotnet\"\r\n- Install directories on Windows x64 and Windows Arm64 don't match.\r\n- We're stuck with dotnet_arm64 on macOS forever, even though that's the only architecture supported (in the long run).\r\n\r\n### Hide architecture differences\r\n\r\nPremise: These differences don't need to be so apparent. We already have version folders under dotnet. We can add arch folders (or something similar). This option has a lot of sub-options, too.\r\n\r\n**Option 1** -- Insert a new folder, with discrete .NET hives underneath:\r\n\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/arm64\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/x64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet/arm64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet/x64\r\n\r\n**Option 2** -- Intermix architectures in one structure (here, just shown with Windows, for simplicity):\r\n\r\n- For \"dotnet\"\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/arm64/dotnet\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/x64/dotnet \r\n- For frameworks\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared_arm64\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\6.0.0-preview.3.21181.6\\\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared_x64\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\6.0.0-preview.3.21181.6\\\r\n\r\nPut \"x64\" and \"arm64\" somewhere in the folder hierarchy. Where it is, is an implementation decision. It is the same (in spirit) as C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework and C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64.\r\n\r\n**Option 3** -- Arm64 is native architecture with x64 intermixed in:\r\n\r\n- For \"dotnet\"\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/dotnet\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/x64/dotnet \r\n- For frameworks\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\6.0.0-preview.3.21181.6\\\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared_x64\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\6.0.0-preview.3.21181.6\\\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- We can manage Arm64 and x64 builds within a single structure in a way that we see as best, both now and over time.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n- Same cons as \"Native dotnet\"\r\n\r\n### Hide architectural differences with universal binaries\r\n\r\nBoth Windows and macOS offer a form of universal binaries, which we could use as a multiplexer between the two 64bit products. There are two problems with that.\r\n\r\n- We don't have enough information in all scenarios to know which architecture is the right one.\r\n- The Windows implementation (per our understanding) isn't as feature rich as we'd need to make all scenarios work, like debuggers.\r\n\r\nWe're rejecting this option for now. We could decide to adopt this solution on macOS and not Windows, should feedback push us in that direction.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility Wins\r\n\r\nPremise: People have already installed .NET x64 on Apple Silicon machines. We need to respect that. This is the opposite of \"Native dotnet\"\r\n\r\nWe'd end up with the following:\r\n\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet_arm64\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet _arm64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- Good compatibility for existing Apple Silicon .NET users.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n- Windows doesn't necessarily need this solution. We can change .NET before it ships with x64 support.\r\n- x64 gets the \"good name\" forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Hard design questions\r\n\r\n- **Developer UX**\r\n  - Would it be good enough to only have the platform native dotnet available on `PATH` by default (Native Dotnet solution above)? \r\n  - On Windows x64 the native .NET is typically the one on the `PATH` is already the case since typically only the x64 dotnet is on `PATH`, but it's possible to use it to build, run and test x86 apps.\r\n- **User UX**\r\n  - can we fully rely on apphost to solve the problem of picking the right archtiecture to run the app with? Different way to ask this: How common is it to run applications via \"dotnet app.dll\"?\r\n  - Is it possible to release new versions of downlevel installers (3.1 and 5) for macOS x64 and Windows x64 which would be ARM64 aware and could move the default location of the downlevel runtimes?\r\n  - How hard is it to create an x64 installer which can detect that it runs on ARM64 hardware and can change behavior based on that? This is dependent on the installer technology on Windows and macOS.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16896","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RFC: dotnet [Arm64 | x64] coexistence\" (#16896)"},{"Id":"857178316","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T02:49:38","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"16882","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/5.0.3xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:7666283a-d651-49ba-e47b-08d8d8feb298)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 7666283a-d651-49ba-e47b-08d8d8feb298\r\n- **Build**: 20210310.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/10/2021 8:46 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 670382be6a978ba401c21c57ba44311199d2682a\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/5.0\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions**: [from 5.0.0-beta.21159.7 to 5.0.0-beta.21160.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 5.0.0-beta.21159.7 to 5.0.0-beta.21160.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 5.0.0-beta.21159.7 to 5.0.0-beta.21160.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool**: [from 5.0.0-beta.21159.7 to 5.0.0-beta.21160.3][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/917ded6...670382b\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:7666283a-d651-49ba-e47b-08d8d8feb298)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16882","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/5.0.3xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#16882)"},{"Id":"857207568","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T02:44:58","Actor":"marcpopMSFT","Number":"16887","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding for 3.1.4xx 3.1.4xx","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16887","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding for 3.1.4xx 3.1.4xx\" (#16887)"},{"Id":"857442158","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T01:37:09","Actor":"richlander","Number":"16895","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enable .NET product to be optimized by making SDK construction coherent","State":"open","Body":"We want to enable various optimizations for the .NET product (particularly in containers).

In addition, some of the apps have package references to the NuGet versions of assemblies that are in the `Microsoft.NETCore.App` layer.\r\n\r\nWe need the following characteristic for SDK apps (like `dotnet-watch`), either exactly as defined or analogous to it:\r\n\r\n- published as framework-dependent, TFM- and RID-specific\r\n- No PackageReferences (at least for the `net*` TFM) to NuGet packages that overlap with assemblies in `dotnet/shared`.\r\n- A shared assembly model to enable single instancing common assemblies used by the SDK (think of this as a \"software suite sharing mode\", which should be built as a generic feature, not an SDK only one).\r\n\r\nWith that model in place, we can optimize the product in weird an wonderful ways with confidence.\r\n\r\nExamples: \r\n\r\n- Generate whole product in one version bubble, enabling better startup and throughput performance.​\r\n- Enable consistent set of optimizations and application of training data across all binaries.​\r\n- Functionally, be certain that our testing of System.Reflection.Metadata (for example) accrues to all scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Evidence\r\n\r\nHere are some simple queries of assemblies that should not be in a Linux x64 container. These queries should all return zero results.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n% docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 find /usr/share/dotnet/sdk | grep System\\. | wc -l   \r\n     236\r\n% docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 find /usr/share/dotnet/sdk | grep runtimes/win | wc -l\r\n      23\r\n% docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 find /usr/share/dotnet/sdk | grep /net4 | wc -l\r\n     279\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change could reduce the size of the SDK by between 50-100MB.\r\n\r\nWe know that there are other files, within the SDK layer, that are duplicated. The queries above should not be considered exhaustive.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16895","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable .NET product to be optimized by making SDK construction coherent\" (#16895)"},{"Id":"857336531","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T00:53:11","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"16893","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unskip tests skipped on MacOS","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29141","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16893","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Unskip tests skipped on MacOS\" (#16893)"},{"Id":"857221547","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T00:08:25","Actor":"marcpopMSFT","Number":"16888","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding for 5.0.2xx 5.0.2xx","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16888","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding for 5.0.2xx 5.0.2xx\" (#16888)"},{"Id":"857315854","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T00:06:53","Actor":"marcpopMSFT","Number":"16890","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding for 3.1.1xx 3.1.1xx","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16890","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding for 3.1.1xx 3.1.1xx\" (#16890)"},{"Id":"857402928","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-13T23:56:55","Actor":"wli3","Number":"16894","RawContent":null,"Title":"Given data/UnixFilePermissions.xml in pack nupkg, when extract package, nuget package extractor can set executable permission according to the file","State":"open","Body":"We need to define data/UnixFilePermissions.xml format.

There are design truths of containers that need to be appreciated:\r\n\r\n- Every run with containers is first run (modulo what happens in `docker build`; the point of this conversation).\r\n- Containers are intended to be fully configured, enabling an instant-on experience.\r\n\r\nAs a result, running actual first run logic is antithetical to containers. We've always run `dotnet help` as a sort of hack to manage first run. That is unintuitive. We know that lots of people clone our Dockerfiles. Big companies, other OSS projects, and other clouds tell us that they do this. They've also expressed their appreciation for the careful design and thoughtfulness we put into the Dockerfiles so that they can easily consume them. This issue is the biggest remaining challenge we have.\r\n\r\nWe recently made [changes to our Dockerfiles](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/2710) to make our first run handling more explicit/intentional. Unfortunately, this is making our [Dockerfiles more verbose](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/34775be8037522332155b895957dae97eed8dfd0/src/sdk/6.0/bullseye-slim/amd64/Dockerfile#L7-L10).\r\n\r\nAnd, we're still relying on [`dotnet help`](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/34775be8037522332155b895957dae97eed8dfd0/src/sdk/6.0/bullseye-slim/amd64/Dockerfile#L34-L35).\r\n\r\nWe'd like a new command -- call it `dotnet init` -- that takes a set of argument that enable us to describe our intent.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet init --no-logo --generate-aspnet-certificate=0 --nuget-xml-doc-mode=skip\r\n```\r\n\r\nHalf of the ENVs we set are used only at startup. That's unfortunate. With the proposed model, we'd get the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- Our Dockerfiles would be shorter and simpler.\r\n- First run would be explicit.\r\n- The locality of first run concerns would be vastly improved, to one line.\r\n- The process state would be improved (fewer ENVs set). This isn't a perf issue, but simplifying our product state and making it easier to understand. I could see the SDK turning these args into ENVs as an implementation detail.

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\nUpdates: \r\n- [NuGet repository signature certificate will expire on April 14th, 2021](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/58)\r\n- [.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions using NSS or ca-certificates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/net-5-nuget-restore-failures-on-linux-distributions-using-nss-or-ca-certificates/) (NuGet blog)\r\n- [.NET April 2021 Updates – 5.0.5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-april-2021-updates/) (.NET blog)\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-3/)\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NuGet package restore broken on .NET 5+ with Removal of Trust of VeriSign CA\" (#180)"},{"Id":"837071846","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"Nirmal4G","Number":"179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master","State":"closed","Body":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179)"},{"Id":"826383777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:01:29","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"178","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 2.1.

This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

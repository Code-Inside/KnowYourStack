The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Here's a reference to complains over the web:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61811825/stop-vs-from-automatically-adding-using-directives\n\nNow, I have a guess that this has to do with another feature that is also annoying: automatic guesses, probably due copilot. More often than I would like, autocomplete eagerly guesses wrong what I wanted to write (and which I don't know how to disable). I have a feeling that that's what is causing the odd \"using\" inclusions: Autocomplete guesses wrong and adds the \"required\" packages for that assumption. And then, even if the developer corrects the false guess, the \"using\" remains.\n\nI have yet to find how to disable the autocomplete with space (a terrible option... if I write \"context[space]\" that probably means that I want to write context, not ContextOverSomeOtherClasss), and I already know how to disable the automatic \"using\" inclusion thanks to stack overflow. But I would challenge you to change your autocomplete strategy. Guessing is very nice when it works, but it's SUPER ANNOYING when it doesn't.

The challenge is finding all the places where your project name is and giving it a new project name. You need to rename two folders, rename two files, go into .sln to edit project and path, and go into three files and edit the namespace:\n\nCopy project folder.\nRename project folder.\nGo into project folder.\nRename the inside project folder.\nRename .sln file.\nEdit inside .sln file and rename project and project path.\nGo into inside project folder.\nRename .csproj file.\nEdit inside Form1.cs and rename namespace.\nEdit inside Form1.Designer.cs and rename namespace.\nEdit inside Program.cs and rename namespace.\nI use Notepad to go inside the .sln and .cs files. It goes pretty fast. I also use GIT, but there are definitely good reasons for a new project, like when you want to do major tweaks and a new project is appropriate, but you want to quickly leverage off your old project. Maybe Microsoft will add a \"Save As\" for projects in the future!\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 12/3/2023, 09:38 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/71348","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"save as, like everyone else\" (#71348)"},{"Id":"2048887253","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-19T17:18:47","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"71347","RawContent":null,"Title":"Suggestions for generic inference","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Suggestions-for-generic-inference/10531126)._\n\n---\npublic static TSecond To<TFirst, TSecond>(TFirst first ) \nI want to provide only one generic when calling, such as: \nTo<YYY>([Redacted]()); // YYY is TSecond,xxx is TFirst object\n\nBut it is currently incorrect grammar.\nI hope it can infer the generic types of formal parameters and only explicitly specify other generic types\n\nIf you think this is useless, I will provide the following example.

Even in the location that dotnet is trying to look for it, it's there:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ which mono\r\n/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/mono\r\n\r\n$ /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/mono --version\r\nMono JIT compiler version 6.12.0.188 (2020-02/ca8abcb6bc4 Thu Oct 13 14:26:22 EDT 2022)\r\nCopyright (C) 2002-2014 Novell, Inc, Xamarin Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com\r\n        ..............................\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother location that dotnet claims to be searching is simply by running `mono`. However, this would not work because of the default SSH configuration, `PermitUserEnvironment no`, which would restrict the `PATH` environment variable to `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, and `mono` would not be in any of those paths:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS > ssh remotebuilder@my-mac \"echo `$PATH\"\r\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\r\nPS > ssh remotebuilder@my-mac \"which mono\"\r\nmono not found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1. Follow [the instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/) to set up the Mac \r\n2. Install software requirements - Xcode, Visual Studio 2022 for Mac\r\n   - Visual Studio for Mac [is being retired anyway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/what-happened-to-vs-for-mac?view=vsmac-2022), so it might be better to just [install Mono directly](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/mac/)\r\n3. Install dotnet and required workloads (iOS, maui-ios) etc\r\n   - Visual Studio for Windows should do this automatically, but I can't even Pair to Mac using it because it just disconnects me automatically\r\n   - Instead, I've decided to install dotnet to my home folder using [dotnet-install scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script), but installing dotnet using [the installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) works anyway\r\n4. Attempt to run `dotnet publish`, specifying `/p:ServerAddress`, `/p:ServerUser` and `/p:ServerPassword` parameters:\r\n```\r\ndotnet publish -f net8.0-ios -c Release /p:ArchiveOnBuild=true --runtime ios-arm64 /p:CodesignKey=\"My Codesign Provisioning Profile\" /p:CodesignProvision=\"aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd\" /p:ServerAddress=\"my-mac\" /p:ServerUser=remotebuilder /p:ServerPassword=\"remotebuilderspassword\" /p:TcpPort=58181 /p:_DotNetRootRemoteDirectory=/Users/remotebuilder/dotnet/ --verbosity normal\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\nNo exceptions are produced, but the error messages in \"Describe the bug\" are displayed instead.\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- Include the output of `dotnet --info`:\r\n\r\n**Windows**\r\n\r\n```\r\n>

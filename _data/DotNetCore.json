As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

platform. As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

Some calls are significant slower if the default printer is a network printer, even if I explicit set a local printer name.\n\nAfter studying referencesource I think I found the culprit.\n\nI call:\n\nvar printerSettings = new System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings();\n\nprinterSettings.PrinterName = &quot;LOCALPRINTER&quot;;\n\n// the next call is slow if the OS default printer is a network printer\nvar res = printerSettings.DefaultPageSettings.PrinterResolution\n\nInternally FastDeviceCapabilities is called.\n\nFastDeviceCapabilities calls GetOutputPort. But GetOutput port return the port of the default printer and not the port of the given printer!\n\nIn addition, DeviceCapabilities is then called with a wrong combination of printer name and port, don't know if this could lead to additional problems.\n\nResolution: GetOutputPort should return the port of the given printer and not accessing the default printer at all.\n\nBest Regards,\nRaphael\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Raphael Affolter on 1/20/2020, 04:03 AM: \n\n<p>I forgot to mention: .Net Framework 4.6.1</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 1/20/2020, 06:51 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

As an example provided in that issue, this memory manager:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\nprivate sealed class BasicMemoryManager : MemoryManager<byte>\r\n{\r\n    private readonly byte[] _buffer;\r\n    public BasicMemoryManager(int size = 1024) => _buffer = new byte[size];\r\n\r\n    protected override bool TryGetArray(out ArraySegment<byte> segment)\r\n    {\r\n        segment = new ArraySegment<byte>(_buffer);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    public override Span<byte> GetSpan() => _buffer;\r\n\r\n    public override MemoryHandle Pin(int elementIndex = 0) => throw new NotSupportedException();\r\n    public override void Unpin() => throw new NotSupportedException();\r\n    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail two of the following tests:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n[Theory]\r\n[InlineData(0, 32)]\r\n[InlineData(0, 29)]\r\n[InlineData(32, 32)] // fail: length 0\r\n[InlineData(32, 29)] // fail: length -3\r\npublic void OffsetTest(int offset, int length)\r\n{\r\n    var mgr = new BasicMemoryManager(1024);\r\n    var slice = mgr.Memory.Slice(offset, length);\r\n    Assert.Equal(length, slice.Length);\r\n\r\n    var ros = new ReadOnlySequence<byte>(slice);\r\n    Assert.True(ros.IsSingleSegment);\r\n    Assert.Equal(length, ros.Length);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nFailing test has been added in this PR.\r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nLow, as the change is very simple and obvious when you look at `ReadOnlySequence<T>` ctor that accepts `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` (notice line 133 versus lines 140 and 148):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/0d40b482e6b6c232131dc808182d6b32d9d37394/src/System.Memory/src/System/Buffers/ReadOnlySequence.cs#L130-L149\r\n\r\nMoreover, the changed code gets triggered only when creating a `ReadOnlySequence` from a `ReadOnlyMemory` backed by a `MemoryManager`. All other use cases (including creating from an array or from a `ReadOnlyMemory` backed by an array or a string) are unaffected. And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43141","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix ReadOnlySequence created out of sliced Memory owned by MemoryManager\" (#43141)"},{"Id":"1224389900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:24:35","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.26","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43143","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.26\" (#43143)"},{"Id":"1202264239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T04:53:34","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43142)"},{"Id":"1193653850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:51:59","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140)"},{"Id":"1193635046","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T20:08:46","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43139","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43139","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43139)"},{"Id":"1170308034","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T21:59:36","Actor":"Mr-Tao","Number":"43138","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Add missing Oracle RIDs","State":"open","Body":"This change adds previously missing RIDs for OL releases 7, 8 and 9 and respective RHEL counterparts.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43138","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Add missing Oracle RIDs\" (#43138)"},{"Id":"1157840655","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T17:41:49","Actor":"carlossanlop","Number":"43135","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/65741\r\n\r\nI had to update some queues based on the [platforms supported for 3.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1-supported-os.md):\r\n  - Windows 19H1 to 20H2\r\n  - MacOS 1013 and 1014 to 1015 and 1100\r\n\r\nMade sure all the queue names matched something that existed here: https://helix.dot.net/\r\n\r\nThe sample run is here: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=1641884&view=results\r\n\r\nKudos to @hoyosjs for helping me find the right places to change.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43135","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal\" (#43135)"},{"Id":"1114496999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T23:53:09","Actor":"bartonjs","Number":"43132","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues","State":"closed","Body":"Backport https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/48460 to release/3.1 so the tests don't fail on Apple systems that no longer trust the relevant root authority.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43132","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues\" (#43132)"},{"Id":"1082811783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T02:39:11","Actor":"ayakael","Number":"43129","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1]Add RID for Alpine 3.15","State":"closed","Body":"Contributes to dotnet/core#6985\r\nI havn't seen this popup yet, so here is a merge request to add RID for Alpine 3.15.

Inputs go in at one end, generated source files come out at the other end. As we continue to enable and support DSL-like experiences there becomes a desire to be able to 'see' into the workings of the generator. This is especially true for tooling scenarios (such as razor) that are using the generator infrastructure to handle compilation: the tooling\r\nneeds a way of getting extra information out of the generator beyond simply the generated files.\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds a new output type, known as an Intermediate Output, that consists of a simple key value pair, that allows generators to emit arbitrary data. This can then be accessed from the generator run result by any interested party. Much like source file hint names, the key must be unique within a generator, but will not collide across generators.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this API would only take effect in IDE scenarios, and be a no-op on command line builds.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis\r\n{\r\n    public readonly partial struct IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext\r\n    {\r\n+       public void RegisterIntermediateOutput<TSource>(IncrementalValueProvider<TSource> source, Action<IntermediateOutputContext, TSource> action);\r\n+\r\n+       public void RegisterIntermediateOutput<TSource>(IncrementalValuesProvider<TSource> source, Action<IntermediateOutputContext, TSource> action);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n+   public readonly struct IntermediateOutputContext\r\n+   {\r\n+       public CancellationToken CancellationToken { get; }\r\n+\r\n+       public void AddOutput(string name, object value);\r\n+   }\r\n\r\n    public readonly struct GeneratorRunResult\r\n    {\r\n+       public ImmutableDictionary<string, object> Intermediates { get; }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\npublic void Initialize(IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext context)\r\n{\r\n    var provider = context.CompilationProvider.Select(/* .. */);\r\n\r\n    // make outputs available to other consumers\r\n    context.RegisterIntermediateOutput(provider, (context, value) =>\r\n    {\r\n        context.AddOutput(\"key\", value);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // NOTE: can still do more with the provider\r\n    var provider2 = provider.Select(/* .. */);\r\n\r\n    // regular source output\r\n    context.RegisterSourceOutput(provider2, (context, value) => /* .. */);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/63291","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \" Intermediate Generator outputs\" (#63291)"},{"Id":"1333859786","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-09T22:42:13","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"63290","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prevent analyzer/generator authors from using banned APIs","State":"open","Body":"We want to leverage [BannedApiAnalyzer](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/main/src/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BannedApiAnalyzers/BannedApiAnalyzers.Help.md) to try and prevent analyzer/generator authors from using APIs known to be problematic.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to include BannedSymbols.txt in Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.nupkg and have projects which reference it automatically pick it up and enforce the bans in a \"downstream\" fashion.

Please describe.\r\nI am trying to create a cross-platform project with platform-specific implementations of several classes.\r\n\r\nFor most platforms, it would be possible to use the `TargetFrameworkMoniker` to conditionally include files like MAUI does (see e.g. https://github.com/dotnet/maui/blob/main/src/Essentials/src/Essentials.csproj). However, no `TargetFrameworkMoniker` is available for Linux.\r\n\r\nThis currently being unavailable also has the consequence that APIs like https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/69980/files need an [`[UnsupportedPlatform(\"windows\")]` attribute](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/69980/files#diff-8434138e0de5092529cec0baaf4edf6d2aa3395c707fd9721449ed482bfd4c2cR232) rather than only making the APIs available on Unix OSes.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n- A `net7.0-linux` `TargetFrameworkMoniker`\r\n- alternative considered: `OperatingSystem.IsLinux()` - this relies on runtime analysis and makes methods larger or requires a wrapper that returns a platform-specific implementation at runtime.\r\n- alternative considered: using inverse #if to assume that\r\n  > if it is not Windows, iOS, Android, MacOS - it must be Linux\r\n\r\n  Pseudocode: `#if !(WINDOWS || MACOS || IOS || ANDROID)`. This seems brittle.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nThese pages have no pointers about workarounds for this case:\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/libraries#how-to-multitarget","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/27061","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing Linux `TargetFrameworkMoniker`\" (#27061)"},{"Id":"1333766600","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-09T20:41:49","Actor":"GSonofNun","Number":"27059","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet build parameters (-p) don't work when joined by semicolon (;) in dotnet 6.0.400","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs and feature requests.\r\n\r\nIf you believe you have an issue that affects the SECURITY of the platform, please do NOT create an issue and instead email your issue details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET Core 3.1. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n\r\nIf you have .NET Core 3.1 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.8 or SDK 6.0.108 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.1) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.28 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.9) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0 and .NET Core 3.1 updates are also available from Microsoft Update.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe [dotnet/announcements](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements) repo is intended to keep everyone informed about important information related to the .NET platform. It is a one-way broadcast that plays nicely with GitHub notifications, making it desirable to watch/subscribe to it.\r\n\r\nWe've come up with some best practice guidelines on how to use these announcements. Our approach to announcements enables some things to work well and requires a little extra care with others.\r\n\r\n## Design points\r\n\r\nAs a broad description, think of dotnet/announcements as an aggregated mirror of important issues and GitHub notifications as an RSS feed for it. The issues in this repo are NOT the canonical copy, but a mirror.\r\n\r\nThe key design points of dotnet/announcements:\r\n\r\n- Issues-only repo.\r\n- Only a few people can create issues.\r\n- Issues are mirrored copies of issues from other repos.\r\n- Issues are locked immediately.\r\n\r\nThese design points significantly reduce the scale of notifications from this repo, resulting in high signal to noise. It also avoid two sets of uncoordinated discussions. Discussions only occur on the canonical issue.\r\n\r\nNote: We (ab)use \"temporary interaction limits\" so that only a few people can post to the repo. It would be ideal if this model (one-way broadcast) was better supported and we could just pin arbitrary org issues to an read-only announcements repo. \r\n\r\n## Best practices\r\n\r\nThe following best practices are intended to result in best overall community experience.\r\n\r\n### Don't link to dotnet/announcements from GitHub\r\n\r\nGitHub includes [references to other issues or PRs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7038#ref-issue-1224354673) that link to an issue or PR as part of the comment/activity history. It's an excellent feature that helps us understand who else cares about a given topic. We actively rely on it and sometimes [reach out to other projects to help them](https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/3276#issuecomment-1118911927).\r\n\r\nThis feature doesn't work with locked issues (which makes sense). Please do not link -- from GitHub -- to the locked mirror issue on dotnet/announcements, but to the unlocked canonical issue. Your reference will be blocked by the lock. That's counter-productive.\r\n\r\nYou can see this dynamic playing out in the following matching/pair issues. The canonical issue has all the messy (and useful) activity and the locked dotnet/announcement issue is a clean replica.\r\n\r\n- [Canonical issue](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428)\r\n- [dotnet/announcements mirror issue](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218)\r\n\r\nYou'll see the same pattern with other [dotnet/announcement issues](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues).\r\n\r\n### Prefer linking to dotnet/announcements from the web\r\n\r\nThere is value in linking to dotnet/announcements from blogs and other sites (like StackOverflow, just not GitHub). The value is that more people might discover dotnet/announcements, subscribe to it, and be better informed about .NET platform news.\r\n\r\nFrom dotnet/announcements, users can quickly jump to a canonical issue should they want to. However, if you want to link directly to canonical issues, that's A-OK.\r\n\r\n### Create your own queries\r\n\r\nIt is easy to create your own queries of dotnet/announcement issues. The easiest way to do that is via [labels](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels).\r\n\r\nHere are some good ones:\r\n\r\n- [Docker](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Docker)\r\n- [Monthly-Update](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Monthly-Update)\r\n- [Breaking%20Change](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Breaking%20Change)\r\n\r\nLooks like we messed up when we created the breaking change label. Team, let's try to avoid labels with spaces in future. We could change it, but ...\r\n\r\nYou can also create slightly more complex queries:\r\n\r\n- [.NET 6.0 + Security](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASecurity+label%3A%22.NET+6.0%22)\r\n- [.NET 6.0 + Monthly Update](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMonthly-Update+label%3A%22.NET+6.0%22+)\r\n\r\nNote: This best practice creates query links to dotnet/announcements, which can be seen as violating the previous practice. The query links unavoidably target dotnet/announcements.\r\n\r\n### Subscribe to notifications\r\n\r\nSubscribe to notifications will help keep you up to date with .NET Platform news. To subscribe, click the \"Watch\" button.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"614\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/175190716-572b42db-494e-44c9-9a74-add258c234fa.png\">\r\n\r\nYou will want to select \"All Activity\".\r\n\r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/175190922-19c15684-17e1-462c-9fc9-48cfd14cdfef.png\">\r\n\r\n## Bests practices for Microsoft folks\r\n\r\nMicrosoft folks should follow these practices when posting issues to dotnet/announcements\r\n\r\n### Direct reader to the canonical issue\r\n\r\nDirect readers to the canonical issue as an immediate call out, with following pattern:\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7556. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/223\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/227\r\n\r\nThe canonical issue should not link to the dotnet/announcements mirror issue.\r\n\r\n### Consider creating the canonical issue as a discussion\r\n\r\nThe GitHub discussion feature is very good. For issues that are sure to spark feedback and/or benefit from more discussion, you should use a discussion issue.\r\n\r\nGood discussion example: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/discussions/71042\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/229","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet/announcements best practices\" (#229)"},{"Id":"1287906136","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T21:30:32","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"228","RawContent":null,"Title":"`System.Drawing.Common` will only be supported on Windows","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n***Note:** This is a re-post of a design point we already discussed and shipped in .NET 6. I'm posting this here because (1) some people have tried to find it here and (2) some folks have never heard of it.*\r\n\r\nMoving forward, `System.Drawing.Windows` will only be supported on Windows. The library is marked as Windows-only (which results in build warnings when used from cross-platform code) and will throw by default when used from a non-Windows OS. For the time being, there is a runtime switch that enables users to still carry and use their own copy of `libgdiplus`. We intend to remove this functionality eventually as well.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nIn the .NET Core 2.x days we created the `Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility` package which exposes many Windows-only APIs so that more people can migrate to .NET Core. As part of this, we also ported `System.Drawing.Common`. This was mainly meant for .NET Core users that still target Windows, however since Mono already had a cross-platform implementation, we decided to bring that over. The cross-platform functionality is provided via the native library `libgdiplus`. Sadly, `libgdiplus` is a community supported library and at this point effectively unmaintained.\r\n\r\nWhile `libgdiplus` has helped a lot of customers expand to cross-platform it has also caused some headaches. `System.Drawing.Common` is very Windows driven as it is mostly a wrapper around GDI+ and is heavily coupled to Windows Forms, which keeps evolving and diverging from cross-platform graphics. This has caused some confusion over why some things don't work well on Unix or don't work at all.\r\n\r\nThe cross-platform implementation of `System.Drawing.Common` is mainly provided on the native side, via `libgdiplus`. It's effectively a re-implementation of the parts of Windows that `System.Drawing.Common` is depending on. As you can imagine, that makes `libgdiplus` a very non-trivial component. It's around 30k lines of pretty old C code, virtually untested, and lacks a lot of functionality. `libgdiplus` also has a lot of external dependencies for all the image processing and text rendering, such as `cairo`, `pango`, and other native libraries, which makes maintaining and shipping it even more challenging.\r\n\r\nSince `System.Drawing.Common` was really designed to be a thin wrapper over Windows technologies, its cross-platform implementation is a bit like a square peg in a round hole; it's subpar because it was only designed with Windows in mind.\r\n\r\nSince the inclusion of the Mono cross-platform implementation we spent lot of time redirecting issues to `libgdiplus` that never got fixed, or helping people install `libgdiplus` correctly (because it's not part of .NET Core proper). This is very different from other external dependencies we have taken, for example, `icu` or `openssl`, which are high-quality libraries, rather than poorly maintained re-implementation of Windows components. Thus, we have come to believe that it's not viable to get `libgdiplus` to the point where its feature set and quality is on par with the rest of the .NET stack.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed (such as from analysis of NuGet packages) that `System.Drawing.Common` is used on cross-platform mostly for image manipulation like QR code generators and text rendering. We haven't noticed heavy graphics usage as our cross-platform graphics support is very incomplete. For example, right now some components crash on macOS because the native APIs we use have been deprecated and are no longer included with recent macOS releases. We have never gotten a report about that crash; we discovered it ourselves while making `System.Drawing.Common` trim compatible.\r\n\r\nThe usages we see of `System.Drawing.Common` in non-Windows environments are typically well supported with `SkiaSharp` and `ImageSharp`.\r\n\r\nThus, we believe it is not worth investing in making `System.Drawing.Common` work on non-Windows platforms and instead propose we only keep evolving it in the context of Windows Forms and GDI+.\r\n\r\n## Design Approach\r\n\r\nFor more details on the design approach, see [this design document](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234/files?short_path=5a79205#diff-5a79205cd271d8ec2d3c5d74112f6874998e1e1aa7ee00900db727eef25561d8).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/228","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`System.Drawing.Common` will only be supported on Windows\" (#228)"},{"Id":"1284382326","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T00:31:43","Actor":"richlander","Number":"227","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 ","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/71231. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 \r\n \r\nThe [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist) package has historically allowed us to fast-track EventSource API bug fixes out-of-band for .NET Framework 4.x. In recent years we continued to ship versions of this package concurrently with .NET Core releases, but the last time it was used to intentionally distribute out-of-band fixes for .NET Framework was package version 1.1.28 from 2015. The fixes that originally made the package useful have long since been applied to the .NET Framework in-box EventSource API and now we plan to phase out this package. Support for the current 6.0 version of the package will continue for as long as .NET 6.0 is supported but no future versions concurrent with .NET 7 and beyond are planned.\r\n \r\nWe recommend developers targeting .NET Framework 4.x use the in-box version of the EventSource API, System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource. Developers who want to track future feature development in the EventSource API should target System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource included in the latest available release of .NET runtime, currently .NET 6.\r\n \r\n## Details\r\n \r\n### How to migrate away from Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist\r\n \r\n1. For apps and libraries targeting .NET Framework ensure you are targeting at least version 4.6.2. For apps and libraries targeting\r\n .NET Standard, .NET Core, or .NET 5+ no targeting change is needed.\r\n \r\n2. Replace references in source to the namespace `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing`\r\n with `System.Diagnostics.Tracing` instead. For example\r\n \r\n```\r\nusing Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing;\r\n```\r\nshould now be\r\n```\r\nusing System.Diagnostics.Tracing;\r\n```\r\n \r\n3. Remove package references to Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracking.EventSource.Redist from project files. You can do this in Visual Studio UI by selecting References->Manage NuGet packages... , then selecting the package from the installed package list and click the uninstall button. Alternately you can use the [Uninstall command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-uninstall-package) in Visual Studio package manager. For apps developed using the .NET CLI tools you can use the [dotnet remove package command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-remove-package).\r\n \r\n### What happens if I do nothing?\r\n \r\nThe Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package should continue to work as-is, but support for the [latest major version of the package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist/6.0.0) will end November 12, 2024. After that point the package will receive no further fixes for security or any other reason. There are no known security vulnerabilities in this package but it is always possible new issues will be discovered in the future.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/227","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 \" (#227)"},{"Id":"1277625586","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T01:45:44","Actor":"richlander","Number":"226","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET support for Windows 7 and 8.1 will end in January 2023","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7556.

This will include `go-live`, in addition to `sts`.\r\n- Add a new `release-type` property, with immutable values of `lts` or `sts`, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nThe change will be made in two phases:\r\n\r\n- The `release-type` property, and .NET 7 EOL date, will be added on July 13th via https://github.com/dotnet/core/pull/7499.\r\n- The `support-phase` property for .NET 7 will transition from `preview` to `go-live` on September 13th.

Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking Change to .NET Packages on Winget\" (#218)"},{"Id":"1224334047","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T16:38:05","Actor":"leecow","Number":"217","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Package Maintenance\r\n\r\n.NET Core was released in June 2016, and over the last six years, many thousands of NuGet packages have been published under the .NET umbrella. Many of these packages are legacy or out-of-support already. As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered. Please see the [.NET Package Deprecation list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/net-package-deprecation.md) and use issue https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7420 to comment.\r\n\r\n## 22-June Update\r\n\r\nWe have started the 'get-clean' process beginning with DNX packages and will proceed cautiously through the older, out-of-support releases. If you believe this package is deprecated by mistake please file a new [Package Deprecation](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdotnet%2Fcore%2Fissues%2Fnew%3Fassignees%3D%26labels%3Dpackage-deprecation%26template%3D03_package_deprecation.yaml%26title%3D%255BPackageId%255D%253A%2B%255Bversion%2528s%2529%255D&data=05%7C01%7Cleecow%40microsoft.com%7C717f6f8141854cb2a90e08da52fe38d9%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637913549082767132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=jOKETWh%2FPS0YI4wFPL8ErBuGJhawlOCnkqt1QVRaty4%3D&reserved=0) Issue and share your reasoning.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

This is incorrect because C# language rules now allow variables in outer scopes to have the same name as variables in inner scopes (local functions and lambdas create new scopes).\n\n## Example\n\nConsider this code from the issue:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass C\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        int t = 0;  // Renaming this to 't1'\n\n        void ALocalFunction()\n        {\n            int t1 = 0;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Before this fix:** Renaming `t` to `t1` incorrectly reported an \"unresolvable conflict\" with the `t1` variable inside the local function.\n\n**After this fix:** The rename succeeds correctly, as C# allows this shadowing behavior.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `LocalConflictVisitor` class was missing a `VisitLocalFunctionStatement` method. Without this method, local functions were incorrectly treated as being in the same scope as their containing method, rather than creating a new scope boundary. This caused the conflict checker to incorrectly flag outer variables that would shadow inner variables.\n\n## Changes\n\n1. **Added `VisitLocalFunctionStatement` to `LocalConflictVisitor.cs`**\n   - Creates a new scope for local function parameters and body\n   - Prevents false conflicts between outer variables and inner local function variables\n   - Works for both static and non-static local functions\n\n2. **Updated lambda parameter conflict tests**\n   - Updated existing tests to reflect that outer variables can now have the same name as lambda parameters (matching current C# behavior)\n\n3. **Added local function test cases**\n   - Added tests for non-static local functions\n   - Added tests for static local functions\n   - Added tests for local functions with parameters\n\n## Verification\n\nThe fix has been verified to match C# compiler behavior - the compiler accepts code where outer variables have the same name as variables in nested local functions and lambdas.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>C# VS2022 Bug when trying to rename variables in local static functions.</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/C-VS2022-Bug-when-trying-to-rename-vari/10009531)._\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> The VS Rename Dialog reports an \"unresolvable conflict\" for duplicate var names.\r\n> This is logical correct for non-static local functions but not for static ones.\r\n> (The C# compiler accepts duplicate names in such configuration of course) \r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12466233/163428236-f676c824-46fb-457c-b6d5-98cd8671525d.png)\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> ### Original Comments\r\n> \r\n> #### Feedback Bot on 4/11/2022, 03:02 AM: \r\n> \r\n> (private comment, text removed)\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> ### Original Solutions\r\n> (no solutions)</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>@copilot C# has changed, so it is now legal for an outer variable to have the same name as a variable within a nested lambda or local function.

And, as it turns out, they were slightly different in a couple of places (like where diagnostics are placed).\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies all that logic in the following manner:\r\n\r\n1. Similar to 'interpolated strings', we have the lexer be dumb, just determining the start/end of the string token.\r\n2. in the parsing phase we then process the raw-string tokens produced by the lexer.\r\n3. the parser uses the *same* core logic for parsing a raw *interpolated* string as it does for a raw *normal* string.  However, of course during raw-normal parsing, it doesn't actually produce interpolations.\r\n\r\nA good mental model of this is that a raw-normal-string is just a raw-interpolated-string with no interpolations (no amount of `{`s starts an interpolation).  \r\n\r\nBy doing that, errors are for normal vs interpolated raw strings are unified.  As is string value/dedentation computation.\r\n\r\nNote: we have exactly 500 tests around lexing/parsing.  Only 22 had a tiny change in diagnostic location placement due to the unification. I looked into preserving the exact same semantics.  but it was often very strange code that had to be written.  Especially due to the nature of all the different string lexing/parsing routines we have.  So i opted to ensure the vast majority were the same, while also giving totally fine, but slightly different errors, for a few cases.\r\n\r\nRelates to feature https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/55306","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80817","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Unify raw string lexing and parsing\" (#80817)"},{"Id":"3531256588","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T06:54:38","Actor":"hamarb123","Number":"80816","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confusing surperflouos error message involving partial methods and out","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: VS 17.14.14\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Abc(out var x);\n        x += 1;\n    }\n\n    private static partial void Abc(out int x);\n}\n```\n\n[Link](https://lab.razor.fyi/#45rLyMUVUJSfXpSYq5dcLNTHmJyTWFysABXiquZSUFBQKC5JLMlMVijLz0xR8E3MzNPQBAtDJEHAMSlZI7-0RKEssUihQtMaLl6hoG2rYAjh13KBqYKizLLEklSYmQWJRSWZiTkQs2HGZOaVgI2p5fJiLirNi-Lk6Jh_ufVAmgBLAmMFIwA)\n\n**Diagnostic Id**:\n\nCS0165\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n\n1 error on `private static partial void Abc(out int x);` we have `Partial method 'Program.Abc(out int)' must have an implementation part because it has accessibility modifiers.

The method works correctly when parentheses are included: `SyntaxFactory.ParseArgumentList(\"(42)\")`.\n\n### Root Cause\nThe `ParseParenthesizedArguments` method in `ParseExpression.vb` assumes the current token is an OpenParenToken. When it's not, the `TryGetTokenAndEatNewLine` call with `createIfMissing:=False` leaves `openParen` as `Nothing` (null), which later causes issues.\n\n### Solution\nModified `ParseParenthesizedArguments` to gracefully handle missing opening parentheses by:\n1. Checking if the OpenParenToken is found\n2. Creating a missing token with appropriate error diagnostic (BC30199: '(' expected) if not found\n3. Ensuring the method always returns a valid ArgumentListSyntax\n\n### Changes Made\n- **ParseExpression.vb** (9 lines changed):\n  - Removed Debug.Assert statements that caused assertion failures\n  - Added If statement to check if TryGetTokenAndEatNewLine succeeds\n  - Create missing OpenParenToken with proper error diagnostic when not found\n\n- **SyntaxFactoryTests.vb** (25 lines added):\n  - Added comprehensive test `TestParseArgumentListWithoutParentheses`\n  - Verifies no exception is thrown when parentheses are missing\n  - Verifies proper diagnostic errors are reported\n  - Verifies missing tokens are marked correctly\n  - Verifies valid input still works correctly\n\n### Test Results\n- ‚úÖ New test `TestParseArgumentListWithoutParentheses` passes\n- ‚úÖ All 7 SyntaxFactoryTests pass\n- ‚úÖ All 9 SyntaxListTests pass (which use ParseArgumentList)\n- ‚úÖ 54 ParseExpression tests pass\n- ‚úÖ 1239 total VB Syntax tests pass\n- ‚úÖ No regressions detected\n\n### Security Summary\nNo security vulnerabilities introduced.

This is easily worked around by specifying the type parameter to Exchange explicitly, but it seems like we may want to special-case threading-focused APIs like Exchange to opt-out of this inference.\r\n> \r\n> It's of course possible that'll lead to other warts, though, so if this is too niche, feel free to close.\r\n> \r\n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n> ```C#\r\n> #nullable enable\r\n> \r\n> using System;\r\n> using System.Threading;\r\n> \r\n> public class C {\r\n>     private C? _obj;\r\n>     \r\n>     public void Rent()\r\n>     {\r\n>         if (_obj is not null)\r\n>         {\r\n>             C? o = Interlocked.Exchange(ref _obj, null);\r\n>             if (o is not null)\r\n>             {\r\n>                 Use(o);\r\n>             }\r\n>         }\r\n>     }\r\n>     \r\n>     private void Use(C o) {}\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgtghgzgLgpgJwD4GIB2BXANliwtwAEcaeBAsAFBUACATAIy0AMhNDAdACoAWCcEACYBLNAHMA3FVoBmNnUIBhQgG8qhDYQAOCYQDcI8JQH5CAfQD2wAFZTKmwus005NACyEASiRgAKAJROGmr2DprCAGaEvpY2hMJQhGgWMEnYWIGhYapB2ZqKphaEALyEAJJo8AhYFgDGANZwghwAogAetTwQ4nC+/FGx1gA0aTj+dnlhkdFFCUkpoxm5kyGTkwCqUL0W48t5AL57GodZhCcOuTr6hkTuhJu9yjuqJ/tAA==\r\n> \r\n> **Expected Behavior**:\r\n> No warnings\r\n> \r\n> **Actual Behavior**:\r\n> `warning CS8625: Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type.`\r\n> \r\n> cc: @jcouv</issue_description>\r\n> \r\n> <agent_instructions>@copilot.

Validates emitted IL contains correct format strings with negative alignment\n\n- All existing tests continue to pass for both C# and VB compilers\n\n**Files Modified**: 24 files total across compiler core (9 files), tests (10 files), workspaces (4 files), and Visual Studio integration (1 file)\n\nThis comprehensive fix ensures all parts of the compiler, test infrastructure, workspace services, and related tools generate consistent, culture-independent output regardless of the system culture during compilation or testing.\n\nFixes dotnet/roslyn#49826\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n\n<issue_title>FormatException on right padding a interpolated string</issue_title>\n<issue_description>\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight padding a string with interpolated strings throw a System.FormatException\r\n\r\nCode to reproduce:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n\r\n    namespace tmp5\r\n    {\r\n        class Program\r\n        {\r\n            static void Main(string[] args)\r\n            {\r\n                var st = \"1\";\r\n                var st2 = $\"{st,100}\";  // Ok\r\n                var st3 = $\"{st,-100}\"; // FormatException here\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nBug reproduced with net5.0 and netcore3.0 build target.\r\n\r\ndotnet --info\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   5.0.100\r\n Commit:    5044b93829\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     ubuntu\r\n OS Version:  18.04\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         ubuntu.18.04-x64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/5.0.100/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 5.0.0\r\n  Commit:  cf258a14b7\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.404 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  5.0.100 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.10 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.0 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.10 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.0 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nOperating System: Feren OS 2020.07\r\nKDE Plasma Version: 5.19.4\r\nKDE Frameworks Version: 5.72.0\r\nQt Version: 5.14.2\r\nKernel Version: 5.4.0-56-generic\r\nOS Type: 64-bit\r\nProcessors: 16 √ó AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor\r\nMemory: 31,4 GiB of RAM\r\nGraphics Processor: AMD Radeon RX 5700\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nFound this when porting a project from .net framework 4.6.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nI have found no workarounds.</issue_description>\n\n<agent_instructions>Copilot, it looks like we're appending a value in a culture sensitive fashion, instead of in an invariant fashion.

This addresses the challenge developers face when testing custom SDKs in development, particularly for teams like Aspire who need to test SDK changes without full installation.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen developing custom SDKs, it's difficult to test them in-situ. The Aspire team currently has to work around this limitation with complex build configurations (see <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/11502/files#diff-7df52ae746222b673e8f279cb09b643ca3ac312c7033d6e985e1eace8975a67d\">aspire#11502</a>). SDKs loaded via `Directory.Build.props` are evaluated too late in the build process, after certain default properties have been fixed.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis PR introduces `Microsoft.DotNet.FileBasedSdkResolver`, a new MSBuild SDK resolver that:\n\n- **Resolves SDKs from file paths** - Supports both relative and absolute paths\n- **Path detection** - Automatically detects path-like SDK names (containing `/`, `\\`, or starting with `.`)\n- **Flexible resolution** - Resolves relative paths from the project or solution directory\n- **Standard SDK structure** - Works with both `<path>/Sdk/` subdirectory and direct `<path>/` layouts\n- **Priority 4500** - Runs after the workload resolver (4000) but before the default resolver (5000)\n- **File-based app support** - Works seamlessly with file-based C# apps using the `#:sdk` directive\n\n## Usage\n\nDevelopers can now reference SDKs by path in their project files:\n\n```xml\n<Project>\n  <Sdk Name=\"../artifacts/bin/Aspire.SDK\" />\n  \n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\nOr in file-based apps using the `#:sdk` directive:\n\n```csharp\n#:sdk ../artifacts/bin/Aspire.SDK\n\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.AddCSharpApp(\"api\", \"api.cs\");\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\nOr use absolute paths:\n\n```xml\n<Project>\n  <Sdk Name=\"/path/to/CustomSdk\" />\n  <!-- project content -->\n</Project>\n```\n\n## Changes to Directive Parser\n\nUpdated the `#:sdk` directive parser in `VirtualProjectBuildingCommand.cs` to allow path separators (`/` and `\\`) in SDK names, enabling file-based apps to reference local SDKs via relative paths. The parser now uses a separate validation pattern for SDK names that permits paths while still preventing problematic characters.\n\n## Testing\n\n- ‚úÖ 7 comprehensive unit tests for the SDK resolver covering various scenarios\n- ‚úÖ File-based app integration test demonstrating `#:sdk ./CustomSdk` usage\n- ‚úÖ End-to-end validation with sample projects\n- ‚úÖ Code formatted with `dotnet format`\n- ‚úÖ Security scan passed (no vulnerabilities)\n\n## Notes\n\nThe resolver is included in the SDK layout via the `redist.csproj` project reference. As noted in the agent instructions, this resolver is intentionally not included in the Visual Studio-based SDK resolver.\n\nFixes dotnet/sdk#51367\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Add a new SDK Resolver that can load an Sdk by relative path</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Is your feature request related to a problem?

These changes expand the program‚Äôs scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù or ‚Äúnot complete.‚Äù Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe‚Äôve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

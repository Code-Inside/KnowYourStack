Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability which exists when .NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the .NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues **TBD**\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET Core 2.1 application running on .NET Core 2.1.17 or lower\r\n* Any .NET Core 3.1 application running on .NET Core 3.1.3 or lower\r\n* Any .NET 5 application running on .NET 5 Preview 3 or lower\r\n\r\nPlease note that .NET Core 3.0 is now out of support and all applications should be updated to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed. If you have installed one or more .NET Core SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio which will also update your .NET Core SDKs.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.514 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.611 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.806 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.104 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.202 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Before we parsed syntax trees, we would parse and process all .editorconfig files to collect the dotnet_diagnostic severity settings. Then, when parsing a tree we'd compute the .editorconfig rules that applied to that tree and parse the tree. Those trees all got added to the Compilation like anything else, and the compiler would consume that information when computing effective diagnostic severities.\r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\n\r\nFirst there was just a performance issue in the original implementation: if a change happens to an .editorconfig that didn't actually impact the dotnet_diagnostic rules, we'd still reparse trees regardless. We can fix that, but it doesn't address some of the original concerns. If you are editing inside of the diagnostic code, say the CS4242 below:\r\n\r\n    dotnet_diagnostic.CS4242.severity = error\r\n\r\nany single keystroke in there was still going to reparse the entire project. If this is happening in an .editorconfig that shared across all your projects, a single keystroke invalidates _all_ syntax trees, and in turn all compilations.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution #1: Don't Reparse\r\n\r\nThe reparsing was done because of a bit of a misunderstanding: the belief was the compiler was going to potentially apply changes to compiler warnings during parsing at that time, but the parsing wasn't actually dependent on it at all. So we can avoid _reparsing_ trees, but a change to the .editorconfig would still require us to go to each syntax tree and create new compilations replacing all the trees; since those would expose new syntax roots the decltree caches in the compilations would have to be tossed out regardless. This would be an improvement over the current situation, but still means a single keystroke is forcing us to recreate a lot of information in each Compilation.\r\n\r\nWe didn't find a good way to save this option, but it's possible we missed something.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution #2: Move this all to CompilationOptions\r\n\r\nThis is the approach that Andy explored in #44331 and we want to discuss further. This design:\r\n\r\n- Obsoletes SyntaxTree.DiagnosticOptions\r\n- Introduces a SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider, effectively an API for a single method that takes a syntax tree and returns the diagnostics that apply to it. (There's a bit more but not relevant for this conversation.)\r\n- Adds a property to a CompilationOptions to hold onto the provider.\r\n- Replaces the compiler's use of the syntax tree data and only uses the CompilationOptions information when computing effective diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThe upside of this approach is syntax trees don't need to change at all; the addition or changing of an .editorconfig only changes the compilation options, and the compiler could see that only the SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider is changing and not have to drop decltrees or other related caches, and we can be much more efficient here.\r\n\r\nThis however creates strangess in the workspaces layer. Today the Workspace doesn't have to provide any of the values in a CompilationOptions from other state elsewhere: the workspace host just creates the CompilationOptions and that's passed through to the Compilation. Now, there is bit of a cycle we have to deal with. Generally it seems we have to either:\r\n\r\n1. Ignore the SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider given by the host, and overwrite it with one that is backed by the Workspace. Any change to Workspace requires us to update it. This means the object the host passes in is never \"visible\" from the workspace in any way.\r\n2. Keep Project.CompilationOptions lined up to the object the host passes in, and instead have a _different_ CompilationOptions actually given to the Compilation. This will surprise anybody who is ever comparing Project.CompilationOptions against Project.GetCompilation().CompilationOptions.\r\n\r\nWe went with option 1 for Andy's experiment, and then ran into the following issues/surprises:\r\n\r\n1. Taking a Solution, changing an .editorconfig, and then comparing it back to the original solution now shows a change to the CompilationOptions, since a new SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider was made. This broke some solution crawler tests because they saw unexpected project changes, but the resulting behavior would have been correct.\r\n2. Workspace.TryApplyChanges was initially rejected because they didn't support CompilationOption changes. It seemed like we'd have to make a special exception to recognize this case to avoid that break.\r\n3. If a workspace does opt into CompilationOptions changes, we'd need another compat fix. We offer a hook where a workspace can say \"do I support applying this CompilationOptions change?\" The trick we did was this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/2a58f734cd5ae3218841c968df15b00f41350db2/src/VisualStudio/CSharp/Impl/Utilities/CSharpCompilationOptionsChangingService.cs#L29-L30\r\n\r\nWhich was an easy way to say \"is the only thing that changed between these two options the supported values\". It seems we now need call this method with newOptions now being newOptions.WithSyntaxTreeOptionsProvider(oldOptions.SyntaxTreeOptionProvider) so that way the existing code and hooks would continue to work, but that seems surprising and odd in it's own right.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution #3: Don't put it in CompilationOptions, but put it somewhere else\r\n\r\nWe quickly discussed a third option to avoid all of this by making the SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider not be in CompilationOptions, but is directly held by the Compilation. As it stands the Compilation's only inputs are trees, references, and options, so we'd either be making the AnalyzerConfig a top-level input, or have to make another \"options\" type which seemed odd.\r\n"},{"Id":"12561654151","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-08T02:03:40","Actor":"eyalsk","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/14547","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Making global namespaces available to an assembly? good idea? useful? what do you think?\" (#14547) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Hey guys,\n\nMany times, mostly in my testing projects I need to repeat myself over and over again and I have a bunch of namespaces that exists in all of my testing files.\n\nSomething like this: \n\n```\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\n\nusing Exceptions;\n\nusing FluentAssertions;\n\nusing Testing.Utilities.ReSharper;\n\nusing Xbehave;\n\nusing static Testing.Utilities.Lambda;\n```\n\n[Opiumtm's approach](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/14547#issuecomment-254281513):\n\n_I've modified the syntax slightly._\n\n```\n// FileX.cs\nnamespace MyProject\n{\n    using SomeUsings = {\n        System,\n        System.IO,\n        System.Xml,\n        System.Linq,\n        Testing.Utilities.Lambda\n    };\n}\n\n// FileY.cs\nusing MyProject.SomeUsings;\n```\n\n**Restrictions:** \n1.

My specific instance has 310 active threads though when the process deadlocks.  \r\n\r\nI'm using .NET Core 3.1.  The program reads different JSON files for every day for the past year or so, using a different thread for each one for performance (a poor man's in-proc Big Data solution).  The process usually completes in 10 minutes, but it hung for about 9 hours with no obvious forward progress.  Attaching VS, most threads are in various helpers like FastAllocateString, all blocked on the GC.  This behavior just showed up today, meaning the app used one more thread - maybe I passed over some thread number limit with 310 active threads?\r\n[DataExporterThreads.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/files/4741018/DataExporterThreads.txt)\r\n\r\nMost threads are blocked in WKS::gc_heap::wait_for_gc_done.  Thread 93 is doing a GC, but is blocked in SuspendEE trying to get the ThreadStore lock.  In a cursory analysis, I was unable to determine which thread is holding the ThreadStore lock.  There were several threads in JIT_PInvokeEndRarePath calling Thread::RareDisablePreemptiveGC, which oddly calls EnablePreemptiveGC and then blocks (I never got a good explanation from Vance or Chris Brumme on that one).\r\n\r\nI'm attaching the stack trace from each thread.

function pointers in field marshalers","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37295\r\n\r\nThis was fixed in .NET 5 when [field marshalling was completely rewritten](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26340).\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nUsers will be unable to have function pointers as fields in structs that are used in interop scenarios. [Function pointers](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/function-pointers.md) are now supported in the C# language.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nThis can naturally be worked around by using `IntPtr`, `UIntPtr`, `void*`, `nint`, or `nuint` as the field and then casting to the appropriate function pointer type at the usage site in managed code. This would severely degrade the UX for usage of function pointers though.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo. This is supporting a new C# feature and previous .NET runtimes never tested/supported this scenario.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidated both 32 and 64 bit struct of the field marshalling scenario. This follows the same behavior as a `void*` pointer so no new functionality is added just reuse of an existing code path for a new type.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n/cc @tannergooding @333fred @jkoritzinsky @jkotas ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28046","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support function pointers in field marshalers\" (#28046)"},{"Id":"629345338","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-02T16:32:12","Actor":"omajid","Number":"28045","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/2.1] Fix build with clang 10","State":"open","Body":"This contains a grab bag of fixes to fix the build with clang 10.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/23075\r\n\r\n  Fix missing includes in coreclr/src/debug/createdump/\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/33096\r\n\r\n  SList::Init: add missing constructor\r\n\r\n- A subset of https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/22129\r\n\r\n  Just the parts that introduce the THROW_DECL macro in pal.h\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32837\r\n\r\n  This fixes THROW_DECL introduce in the previous PR to work with clang, which\r\n  is required in clang 10.\r\n\r\n- One new change:\r\n\r\n  In a significant divergance, this commits adds more THROW_DECL macros\r\n  to all the math functions to address a ton of errors pointed out when\r\n  building SOS:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n    In file included from /home/omajid/devel/dotnet/coreclr/src/ToolBox/SOS/Strike/strike.cpp:116:\r\n    In file included from /home/omajid/devel/dotnet/coreclr/src/vm/hillclimbing.h:19:\r\n    In file included from /home/omajid/devel/dotnet/coreclr/src/inc/complex.h:16:\r\n    In file included from /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/10/../../../../include/c++/10/math.h:36:\r\n    In file included from /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/10/../../../../include/c++/10/cmath:45:\r\n    In file included from /usr/include/math.h:290:\r\n    /usr/include/bits/mathcalls.h:53:13: error: exception specification in declaration does not match previous declaration\r\n    __MATHCALL (acos,, (_Mdouble_ __x));\r\n                ^\r\n    /home/omajid/devel/dotnet/coreclr/src/pal/inc/pal.h:4395:26: note: previous declaration is here\r\n    PALIMPORT double __cdecl acos(double);\r\n                             ^\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n  Then, to make sure the declarations and implementations match, it adds\r\n  THROW_DECL to the definitions in src/pal/src/cruntime/math.cpp\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Mike McLaughlin <mikem@microsoft.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Sinan Kaya <sinan.kaya@microsoft.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Tom Deseyn <tom.deseyn@gmail.com>","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28045","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/2.1] Fix build with clang 10\" (#28045)"},{"Id":"622546826","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-21T14:41:29","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"28044","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix triggers for 3.1","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28044","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Fix triggers for 3.1\" (#28044)"},{"Id":"622076092","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T20:55:40","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28043","RawContent":null,"Title":"update branding to 2.2.11","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28043","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update branding to 2.2.11\" (#28043)"},{"Id":"622026514","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T19:37:48","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"28042","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/2.1' => 'release/uwp6.2'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/2.1 branch which have not been merged yet to release/uwp6.2.

A usage pattern that worsens this leak is to start tracing, fill up all the buffers, then stop tracing, and repeat that many times. This fix mitigates the issue by making EventPipeBuffer to use ClrVirtualAlloc instead of malloc.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nOn Linux platforms (specifically ones that use glibc), customers may see an unexpected growth in the native heap size over a long period of time if using EventPipe for a long time (ex. using Application Insights Service Profiler), making our first-party and third-party tracing solutions potentially problematic in production scenarios when used for elongated periods of time.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNo, EventPipe buffers were always allocated using malloc.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe fix was tested against the scenario the customer provided and . Additional performance tests that use EventPipe showed minimal performance regression (<4 % in the worst case). \r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nI believe the risk is low - the fix is localized to only 3-lines change and the behavior is well-understood.

The implicit ref is removed in either of these cases:\r\n      - The mutex gets another reference from within the same process\r\n      - The thread that owns the lock exits and abandons the mutex, at which point that would be the last reference to the mutex and the process would not reference the mutex anymore\r\n  - The implementation based on file locks is less restricted, but for consistency that implementation also follows the same behavior\r\n- There was also a race between an exiting thread abandoning one of its locked named mutexes and another thread releasing the last reference to it, fixed by using the creation/deletion process lock to synchronize\r\n\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34271 in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- Random crashes were seen on Unixes\r\n- When a named mutex is locked and the last reference to it is released from a different thread in any process, the underlying pthread mutex object is destroyed and that has undefined behavior.

The original code was a minimal implementation which only covered the instruction form historically used by the JIT.  As new forms and especially intrinsics were added, the code was not updated because the complexity was far too high. \r\n\r\nWe completely missed decode of all x64 simd instruction forms.\r\n\r\nThe fix required was this substantial change.

That frees the handle, but leaves it on the cleanup\r\nlist of the loader allocator. The same handle can be later allocated for\r\nsome\r\nother purpose. When the AssemblyLoaderAllocator is being destroyed, all\r\nthe handles on the cleanup list are destroyed too. So it destroys also\r\nthe handle that was left on the cleanup list incorrectly. That can cause\r\nall kinds of hard to diagnose issues, like the\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/32171.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it by adding a FreeGCHandle method on the\r\nRuntimeTypeHandle that besides freeing the handle also removes it from\r\nthe cleanup list of the related AssemblyLoadContext.\r\n\r\n ## Customer impact\r\nHard to diagnose crashes in the runtime caused by closing of random\r\nGC handles.

In 2.1 and 2.2, the thread that loses\r\nthe race destroys the handle only if the type was not in a collectible\r\nassembly. Since the non-collectible assemblies LoaderAllocator is never\r\ndestroyed, the handles were never cleaned up and so no problem could occur.\r\nIt was introduced in https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21737\r\n\r\n ## Testing\r\nCustomer affected by the issue heavily has tested a fixed version and\r\nreported the issue doesn't occur anymore.\r\n\r\n ## Risk\r\nLow, the new code is executed at single place once per process runtine\r\nonly when a thread races for allocating the GC handle with another one\r\nand loses the race.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28025","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Port to 3.1: Fix allocation of RuntimeTypeCache GC handle\" (#28025)"},{"Id":"569148773","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-25T20:35:59","Actor":"hoyosjs","Number":"28023","RawContent":null,"Title":"[3.1 port] Fix debugger crash during unload of assemblies in ALC","State":"closed","Body":"Issue dotnet/runtime#2317 reports that trying to use unloadable ALCs under the debugger often ends up in a crash.

(This will be done with the first commit, so that it is easier to review this commit by commit.)\r\n- [X] Add Net461 configuration to OpenSSL OOB package which also needs it, but it will be treated specially given that it requires some special types in S.S.C.Algorithms that are not present in 461. (Done with commit 10df782)\r\n- [x] Baseline all of the packages that have new configurations from steps 1 and 2, and now service all packages above that depend on them so that all new package versions will depend on these new packages that have the new configs. After doing this, all of our latest NuGet packages should not require the .NET Standard shims.

Before we parsed syntax trees, we would parse and process all .editorconfig files to collect the dotnet_diagnostic severity settings. Then, when parsing a tree we'd compute the .editorconfig rules that applied to that tree and parse the tree. Those trees all got added to the Compilation like anything else, and the compiler would consume that information when computing effective diagnostic severities.\r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\n\r\nFirst there was just a performance issue in the original implementation: if a change happens to an .editorconfig that didn't actually impact the dotnet_diagnostic rules, we'd still reparse trees regardless. We can fix that, but it doesn't address some of the original concerns. If you are editing inside of the diagnostic code, say the CS4242 below:\r\n\r\n    dotnet_diagnostic.CS4242.severity = error\r\n\r\nany single keystroke in there was still going to reparse the entire project. If this is happening in an .editorconfig that shared across all your projects, a single keystroke invalidates _all_ syntax trees, and in turn all compilations.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution 1: Don't Reparse\r\n\r\nThe reparsing was done because of a bit of a misunderstanding: the belief was the compiler was going to potentially apply changes to compiler warnings during parsing at that time, but the parsing wasn't actually dependent on it at all. So we can avoid _reparsing_ trees, but a change to the .editorconfig would still require us to go to each syntax tree and create new compilations replacing all the trees; since those would expose new syntax roots the decltree caches in the compilations would have to be tossed out regardless. This would be an improvement over the current situation, but still means a single keystroke is forcing us to recreate a lot of information in each Compilation.\r\n\r\nWe didn't find a good way to save this option, but it's possible we missed something.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution 2: Move this all to CompilationOptions\r\n\r\nThis is the approach that Andy explored in #44331 and we want to discuss further. This design:\r\n\r\n- Obsoletes SyntaxTree.DiagnosticOptions\r\n- Introduces a SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider, effectively an API for a single method that takes a syntax tree and returns the diagnostics that apply to it. (There's a bit more but not relevant for this conversation.)\r\n- Adds a property to a CompilationOptions to hold onto the provider.\r\n- Replaces the compiler's use of the syntax tree data and only uses the CompilationOptions information when computing effective diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThe upside of this approach is syntax trees don't need to change at all; the addition or changing of an .editorconfig only changes the compilation options, and the compiler could see that only the SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider is changing and not have to drop decltrees or other related caches, and we can be much more efficient here.\r\n\r\nThis however creates strangess in the workspaces layer. Today the Workspace doesn't have to provide any of the values in a CompilationOptions from other state elsewhere: the workspace host just creates the CompilationOptions and that's passed through to the Compilation. Now, there is bit of a cycle we have to deal with. Generally it seems we have to either:\r\n\r\n1. Ignore the SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider given by the host, and overwrite it with one that is backed by the Workspace. Any change to Workspace requires us to update it. This means the object the host passes in is never \"visible\" from the workspace in any way.\r\n2. Keep Project.CompilationOptions lined up to the object the host passes in, and instead have a _different_ CompilationOptions actually given to the Compilation. This will surprise anybody who is ever comparing Project.CompilationOptions against Project.GetCompilation().CompilationOptions.\r\n\r\nWe went with option 1 for Andy's experiment, and then ran into the following issues/surprises:\r\n\r\n1. Taking a Solution, changing an .editorconfig, and then comparing it back to the original solution now shows a change to the CompilationOptions, since a new SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider was made. This broke some solution crawler tests because they saw unexpected project changes, but the resulting behavior would have been correct.\r\n2. Workspace.TryApplyChanges was initially rejected because they didn't support CompilationOption changes. It seemed like we'd have to make a special exception to recognize this case to avoid that break.\r\n3. If a workspace does opt into CompilationOptions changes, we'd need another compat fix. We offer a hook where a workspace can say \"do I support applying this CompilationOptions change?\" The trick we did was this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/2a58f734cd5ae3218841c968df15b00f41350db2/src/VisualStudio/CSharp/Impl/Utilities/CSharpCompilationOptionsChangingService.cs#L29-L30\r\n\r\nWhich was an easy way to say \"is the only thing that changed between these two options the supported values\". It seems we now need call this method with newOptions now being newOptions.WithSyntaxTreeOptionsProvider(oldOptions.SyntaxTreeOptionProvider) so that way the existing code and hooks would continue to work, but that seems surprising and odd in it's own right.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution 3: Don't put it in CompilationOptions, but put it somewhere else\r\n\r\nWe quickly discussed a third option to avoid all of this by making the SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider not be in CompilationOptions, but is directly held by the Compilation. As it stands the Compilation's only inputs are trees, references, and options, so we'd either be making the AnalyzerConfig a top-level input, or have to make another \"options\" type which seemed odd.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/44936","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Design issues for speeding up .editorconfig processing\" (#44936)"},{"Id":"633982605","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-08T01:55:32","Actor":"agocke","Number":"44935","RawContent":null,"Title":"Emit Clone methods in abstract records as abstract","State":"open","Body":"The clone method is designed to call the containing type's\r\nconstructor, but this can't be done when the containing type\r\nis abstract.

Rather treat is as a collection of observations and pain points which other source generator authors are likely to hit. You might decide to take input from these, or not. Please feel free to close this issue at any point.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nI've got a library which wraps HttpClient, making it a bit more terse to use. Users define an interface which might look a bit like this:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic interface ISomeApi\r\n{\r\n    [Get(\"users\")]\r\n    Task<User> GetUser([Query] string userId);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand call it like this:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nISomeApi api = RestClient.For<ISomeApi>(\"https://api.example.com\");\r\nvar user = await api.GetUser(\"canton7\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, I generate an implementation which looks something like this (simplified):\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic class SomeApi : ISomeApi\r\n{\r\n    private readonly IRequester requester;\r\n    public SomeApi(IRequester requester) => this.requester = requester;\r\n    public Task<User> GetUser(string userId)\r\n    {\r\n        var requestInfo = new RequestInfo(HttpMethod.Get, \"users\");\r\n        requestInfo.AddQueryParameter(\"userId\", userId);\r\n        return this.requester.RequestAsync<User>(requestInfo);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTypes like `RestClient`, `IRequester` and `RequestInfo` are contained in an assembly which the user references.\r\n\r\nGeneric interfaces, generic methods (with and without type constraints), interface inheritance, etc, are all supported.\r\n\r\nI've traditionally done this generation at runtime using System.Reflection.Emit. Source generators seemed like the perfect tool, so I jumped on them. I wanted to keep the same API though, so I avoided partial classes, and instead generate an assembly-level attribute linking together a user's interface with its generated implementation, then instantiate the implementation using reflection in `RestClient.For<T>`.\r\n\r\n## Turning symbols into strings\r\n\r\nProbably the trickiest part was generating the type and method signatures as strings. I'm lucky that I had the interface being implemented as an `INamedTypeSymbol`, and so I could use `ISymbol.ToDisplayString` (and [this long list of `SymbolDisplayFormats`](https://github.com/canton7/RestEase/blob/develop/src/RestEase.SourceGenerator/Implementation/SymbolDisplayFormats.cs)) to get me most of the way there. This has logic to handle things like:\r\n\r\n1. Fully-qualifying types (including `global::` and the full namespace)\r\n2. Escaping keywords, like `event` or `params`\r\n3. Generating generic type constraints\r\n4. Generating method declarations, including default values, `in`/`out`/`ref`, etc\r\n\r\nHowever, I always wondered whether I was using the correct tool: what I'm generating isn't a display string, it's C# code.\r\n\r\nGenerating things such as `class Implementation_1_ISomeApi<@params> : global::Their.Namespace.ISomeApi<@params>` and `typeof(Implementation_1_ISomeApi<>)` also needed some extra string manipulation.\r\n\r\nGenerating safe code, such as fully-qualifying all type names and escaping keywords, was also an opt-in choice, rather than the default. I'm concerned that many community-authored source generators simply won't take this level of care.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure how much harder things would have been if I hadn't have been able to use the `ISymbol`s from the interface I was implementing: I've got no way to generate my own symbols on which I can call `ToDisplayString()`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I know there has been talk of adding a tool which helps users generate valid (and suitably qualified and escaped) C# code, but I don't have a clear picture of what I'd like such a tool to look like. Hopefully my use-cases can help.\r\n\r\n## Unique names\r\n\r\nWhen generating types using S.R.E., we have the luxury of unspeakable names, ensuring that field/local names don't clash with field/local names that the user has specified. Source generators don't have this. \r\n\r\nI ended up iterating through all members looking for potential collisions with my chosen field/local name, and appending numbers until I found something that was unique. I'm not sure what a good general solution is here: given that we (presumably) want source-generated types to be normal, valid C#, I don't think there's anything else which can be done.\r\n\r\nThis is another area where I fear that community source generator authors might not be so careful. Some sort of tool to help ensure that a name is unique in a given scope would be nice. Perhaps you give it a prefix, and it returns something starting with that prefix which is unique, both among members and among other generated names.\r\n\r\n## Diagnostics\r\n\r\nBeing able to generate diagnostics was nice.\r\n\r\nI did end up adding some of my own logic which ensured that I didn't output a `SourceText` if I also generated any error-level diagnostics, for a given type: if I hit errors when processing a user's interface, I wanted to keep processing it in case I discovered other errors that I wanted to report to the user, but I didn't want to output any generated implementation as that would certainly be invalid, and add further confounding errors. After all, errors mean that I *can't* generate a valid implementation.\r\n\r\nOf course, there's no relationship between a `SourceText` and the diagnostics which were encountered when generating it in the current source generator API, so I had to implement this myself. Bear in mind that I did also generate compilation-level diagnostics, which don't refer to any specific user interface that I'm processing.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether my case is common enough to consider adding explicit support for: I suspect it might be, as I suspect most source generators will be working on individual user-defined inputs (be they types or additional files), each of which can succeed or fail, but I've only got one data point.\r\n\r\nI did also discover `WellKnownDiagnosticTags.NotConfigurable`. This is useful, as any errors I encounter mean that the compilation process wasn't able to succeed, and I don't want the user suppressing those and then hitting errors at runtime instead. However I suspect many source generator authors might not be aware of it.\r\n\r\n## Compiler versions\r\n\r\nI'm assuming the user can have free choice over `LangVersion`, and this also affects code generated by source generators. Yes, source generators can look at the compilation to see what the langauge version is, but at the end of the day most will be written for some minimum C# language version, and won't be capable of generating anything below that.\r\n\r\nI ended up picking C# 3 as my minimum language version, and generating C# source which used only C# 3 syntax.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether it would be possible to allow source-generated files to use a different language version to the rest of the compilation: I suspect not. Even so, this would only move the problem: I could assume that the language version current when source generators were first released is available, but nothing beyond that.\r\n\r\nThis also affects things like NRTs, as these are probably desirable if supported, but simply aren't available before C# 8. Whether or not they're enabled project-wide can be worked around using `#nullable`, if the source generator author remembers. This also relates to the \"Turning symbols into strings\" section above. (Luckily I was able to sidestep this by disabling NRTs for my generated files, and relying on any NRT annotations on the interface).\r\n\r\nPerhaps a good solution is to force source generators to declare the C# version of source that they generate. That at least forces authors to think about what they want to support, and means VS can give nice errors if the user has a lower `LangVersion` selected.\r\n\r\n## Hiding generated types\r\n\r\nI want my generated types to be hidden from intellisense. In recent VS versions, typing `ISomeApi` will also suggest my generated `Implementation_1_ISomeApi` type, even though it's in a different namespace. I don't want my generated type to clutter the user's intellisense, and I don't want the user to try and interact directly with it (they should go through `RestClient.For<T>`).\r\n\r\n`[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]` doesn't affect types in the current assembly, and `[CompilerGenerated]` doesn't affect anything here. I did end up adding `[Obsolete]` onto my types's constructor so at least they can't instantiate it.\r\n\r\nI think allowing `EditorBrowsable` to hide types in the current assembly would help a lot here.\r\n\r\n## NuGet\r\n\r\nMy generated C# files rely on the user referencing my \"main\" NuGet package, because they reference various types from that package. The generated source also has a minimum version of the main package that it requires, since some required types were only introduced when I started writing the source generator. The source generator assembly itself doesn't reference anything.\r\n\r\nI therefore wanted my source generator NuGet package to declare a dependency on my main package, so that anyone trying to install the source generator automatically got the necessary reference to a suitable version of the main package. \r\n\r\nI couldn't find a way to do this using directives in my `csproj`: there didn't seem to be a way to say \"I have a dependency on version X of package Y, and users should also reference that, but I don't actually want a reference to it myself\". I ended up falling back to writing my own `.nuspec`, which does support this.\r\n\r\nI suspect I'm not the only one in this situation: most source generated code will require types from another assembly. Adding the necessary support to `csproj` might be nice.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/44929","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feedback from writing a source generator\" (#44929)"},{"Id":"632830669","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-07T03:21:36","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"44926","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge records feature into master","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/44926","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merge records feature into master\" (#44926)"},{"Id":"632857323","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-07T00:32:37","Actor":"KirillOsenkov","Number":"44927","RawContent":null,"Title":"Interactive: impossible to customize DesktopHost directory","State":"open","Body":"There is no way I can see to customize the InteractiveHost directory where it looks for the host exe:\r\nhttp://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.EditorFeatures.Wpf/Interactive/InteractiveEvaluator.cs,cf939feb7aa934e9\r\n\r\nOptions are created in GetHostOptions() and threaded through and there isn't really a good way to hack it with Reflection either.

Thread 93 is doing a GC, but is blocked in SuspendEE trying to get the ThreadStore lock.  In a cursory analysis, I was unable to determine which thread is holding the ThreadStore lock.  There were several threads in JIT_PInvokeEndRarePath calling Thread::RareDisablePreemptiveGC, which oddly calls EnablePreemptiveGC and then blocks (I never got a good explanation from Vance or Chris Brumme on that one).\r\n\r\nI'm attaching the stack trace from each thread.  I have a mixed mode dump captured by VS.  Happy to upload it somehow, somewhere.  400 MB compressed.  \r\n\r\nThread 93's portion back in native code:\r\n\r\nntdll!NtWaitForAlertByThreadId+0x14\r\nntdll!RtlpWaitOnAddressWithTimeout+0x43\r\nntdll!RtlpWaitOnAddress+0xb2\r\nntdll!RtlpWaitOnCriticalSection+0xdb\r\nntdll!RtlpEnterCriticalSectionContended+0xcc\r\nntdll!RtlEnterCriticalSection+0x40\r\ncoreclr!CrstBase::Enter+0x49 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\vm\\crst.cpp @ 319] \r\ncoreclr!ThreadStore::Enter+0x10 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\vm\\threads.cpp @ 5255] \r\ncoreclr!ThreadSuspend::LockThreadStore+0x7d [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\vm\\threadsuspend.cpp @ 2361] \r\ncoreclr!ThreadSuspend::SuspendEE+0xf7 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\vm\\threadsuspend.cpp @ 6443] \r\ncoreclr!GCToEEInterface::SuspendEE+0x21 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\vm\\gcenv.ee.cpp @ 25] \r\ncoreclr!WKS::GCHeap::GarbageCollectGeneration+0xff [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\gc\\gc.cpp @ 36545] \r\ncoreclr!WKS::gc_heap::trigger_gc_for_alloc+0x12 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\gc\\gc.cpp @ 13832] \r\ncoreclr!WKS::gc_heap::try_allocate_more_space+0x24e [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\gc\\gc.cpp @ 13934] \r\ncoreclr!WKS::gc_heap::allocate_more_space+0x11 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\gc\\gc.cpp @ 14369] \r\ncoreclr!WKS::gc_heap::allocate+0x58 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\gc\\gc.cpp @ 14400] \r\ncoreclr!WKS::GCHeap::Alloc+0x88 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\gc\\gc.cpp @ 35827] \r\ncoreclr!Alloc+0x12f [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\vm\\gchelpers.cpp @ 240] \r\ncoreclr!AllocateString+0x195 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\vm\\gchelpers.cpp @ 996] \r\ncoreclr!FramedAllocateString+0x82 [f:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\vm\\jithelpers.cpp @ 2884] \r\n<managed code running in a Task<T> to deserialize JSON>\r\n\r\nA set of threads were blocked on the GC mode around a P/Invoke call to ReadFile.\r\n\r\n[0x1]   KERNELBASE!WaitForSingleObjectEx + 0x8f   \r\n[0x2]   coreclr!CLREventWaitHelper2 + 0x6   \r\n[0x3]   coreclr!CLREventWaitHelper + 0x20   \r\n[0x4]   coreclr!CLREventBase::WaitEx + 0x12   \r\n[0x5]   coreclr!CLREventBase::Wait + 0x12   \r\n[0x6]   coreclr!Thread::WaitSuspendEventsHelper + 0xa9   \r\n[0x7]   coreclr!Thread::WaitSuspendEvents + 0x8   \r\n[0x8]   coreclr!Thread::RareEnablePreemptiveGC + 0x1342ec   \r\n[0x9]   coreclr!Thread::EnablePreemptiveGC + 0x116   \r\n[0xa]   coreclr!Thread::RareDisablePreemptiveGC + 0x1c6   \r\n[0xb]   coreclr!JIT_PInvokeEndRarePath + 0x69   \r\n[0xc]   System_Private_CoreLib!Interop+Kernel32.ReadFile(System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle, Byte*, Int32, Int32 ByRef, IntPtr)$##6000044 + 0xbf  \r\n\r\nBrian (who left the BCL team 8 years ago)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/11936","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Deadlock while trying to Suspend EE & acquire threadstore lock from the GC\" (#11936)"},{"Id":"633356696","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-07T14:21:54","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"11942","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from mono/linker","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:769e6472-e796-4bcb-a0ac-08d7dbf4acc5)\r\n## From https://github.com/mono/linker\r\n- **Subscription**: 769e6472-e796-4bcb-a0ac-08d7dbf4acc5\r\n- **Build**: 20200606.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 6/6/2020 8:43 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 934da9dc125cd110ee28685529624fbbf3152ab5\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability which exists when .NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the .NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36313\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET Core 2.1 application running on .NET Core 2.1.17 or lower\r\n* Any .NET Core 3.1 application running on .NET Core 3.1.3 or lower\r\n* Any .NET 5 application running on .NET 5 Preview 3 or lower\r\n\r\nPlease note that .NET Core 3.0 is now out of support and all applications should be updated to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed. If you have installed one or more .NET Core SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio which will also update your .NET Core SDKs.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.514 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.611 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.806 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.104 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.202 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

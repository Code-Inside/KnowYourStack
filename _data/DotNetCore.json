name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

The warning incorrectly references the implicit receiver parameter instead of the actual user-provided parameter.\n\n### Root Cause\nFor implicit extension member access methods in collection initializers:\n- The receiver is stored in `ImplicitReceiverOpt`, not in the Arguments array\n- The nullable flow analysis wasn't creating a synthetic receiver argument for analysis\n- This caused parameter-to-argument mapping to be incorrect, leading to spurious warnings\n\n### Solution\nModified `VisitCollectionElementInitializer` in NullableWalker to:\n- Detect implicit extension member access methods (`IsExtensionBlockMember()`)\n- Call `ReInferMethodAndVisitArguments` for new extension methods when not delaying completion (reusing existing logic)\n- For delayed completion scenarios, manually prepend receiver result after visiting arguments\n- Update `addMethodAsMemberOfContainingType` and `setUpdatedSymbolAsContinuation` to handle this case\n\nThe fix leverages existing `ReInferMethodAndVisitArguments` logic to avoid duplication and ensure consistent handling of new extension methods.\n\n### Testing\n- Added comprehensive test case covering both valid and nullable argument scenarios\n- All 4480 nullable reference type tests pass\n- All 2052 extension tests pass\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Unexpected nullable warning in object initializer member using extension Add method</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: \n> \n> **Steps to Reproduce**: [.NET Lab](https://lab.razor.fyi/#fVHRihMxFGVhVzRPsl9wwIdpX2bFBxFrC6UUWVEQt0-KaDpzZwxk7pTkZrelzB_4Lz75Bz4K_onfIOlk266IeUhI7j3n5J6jfpwp9da1tdNNXvjz72ePOFirl5ZAHA8VvOEaVxsv1Izu3PJZay0VYlr2-Uticqb4T8dl0wSJlCOlCqu9RxJWWwUAXrSYAtetKfFGGx4Md899Ma7LOYeGXKR44cUZricwQo3HGB8-jvZ9nzAG0w1mieEuy44pobYJ3-HiAoFpvaJCqMSNdhynmF09e_rk8XNMXR0aYkFbQTYrQvaPv2QoNHMrWBKCpxJV67DSTjck5JBZ4yU7MLw2Xg5Qw8jma8lpLcTetHxbGhz3DTOUgSAtSlNV5IgL8hErXwh9cMYa2UQVR6kBUc_newO63qlOdbc5zFICq7C0psCxYrJqi5pkBB-3LtndKZUi61nma0k8hyEW6f-LCeL4fyeaBHeRT8tycOzqYoJrbQP5IcY9Op-W5TvNNQ1SYT_I-WmjDb-6R861zr9_cP_3t19ff1YPTz-frE_-AA)\n> \n> ```cs\n> #nullable enable\n> using System;\n> using System.Collections.Generic;\n> using System.Collections.Immutable;\n> \n> class Program\n> {\n>     static void Main()\n>     {\n>         IEnumerable<string> items = [];\n>         _ = new C()\n>         {\n>             Items = { items } // unexpected warning CS8620: Argument of type 'IEnumerable<string>' cannot be used for parameter 'list' of type 'List<string>' in 'Ext.extension<string>(List<string>)' due to differences in the nullability of reference types.\n>         };\n>     }\n> }\n> \n> class C\n> {\n>     public List<string> Items { get; set; } = [];\n> }\n> \n> static class Ext\n> {\n>     extension<T>(List<T> list)\n>     {\n>         public void Add(IEnumerable<T> values) => list.AddRange(values);\n>     }\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> **Expected Behavior**: No warnings are reported\n> \n> **Actual Behavior**: A nullable warning is reported for 'items'.

Many people start programming by Visual Studio + C#/VB.NET + WinForms/WPF even today. This stack is the only one that provides the visual graphic form designer and very friendly to beginners.\n\nExplanations in .NET Framework are localized to some non-English languages, but those in .NET are NOT and served ONLY IN English. This is virtually a regression.\n\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=Ba389ad4eb5fe43028f281c2e60a1b5f2638847721028085058_20250606-110141-image.png&tid=a389ad4eb5fe43028f281c2e60a1b5f2638847721028085058)\n\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=B8f8de042d9324d968cdd991e2c7b048b638847721610552533_20250606-110240-image.png&tid=8f8de042d9324d968cdd991e2c7b048b638847721610552533)\n\nIf you push .NET over .NET Framework, you must provide a way to translate English explanations on classes and methods provided by .NET or 3rd-party libraries. Luckily, LLMs that power GitHub Copilot have an ability to translate English input text into another language.

But if it fixes NUnit2055 first, it triggers a bug in the analyzer (https://github.com/nunit/nunit.analyzers/issues/953) that generated non-compiling code.\nThe order seems to be random each time I repeat this test.\n\nTo be clear: The non-compiling code is a separate bug.\nI'm raising this issue because I believe that `dotnet format` should produce the same results each time it is invoked.\nI only used this issue in NUnit because is makes it obvious that the order of the fixes is different.\nThe analyzer doesn't seem to have a random components to it, so maybe this is a race condition.\n\nAlso: Using the \"Fix all warning and errors set in EditorConfig\" cleanup in VS18 (Community Insiders [11201.2]) seems to always fix the warning in the same order.\n\n### Further technical details\n<details><summary>details of dotnet --info</summary>\n<p>\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107\n Commit:            89c8f6a112\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.4d32cd9e\n MSBuild version:   18.0.0-preview-25502-107+89c8f6a11\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26200\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\nNo workload sets are installed.

Here's my csproj definition if that is meaningful:\n\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WebAssembly\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>\n    <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>\n    <RuntimeIdentifier>browser-wasm</RuntimeIdentifier>\n    <OverrideHtmlAssetPlaceholders>true</OverrideHtmlAssetPlaceholders>\n\n    <PublishTrimmed>true</PublishTrimmed>\n    <RunAOTCompilation>true</RunAOTCompilation>\n    <WasmStripILAfterAOT>true</WasmStripILAfterAOT>\n    <!-- <WasmSingleFileBundle>true</WasmSingleFileBundle> --> <!-- explosions -->\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Necronomicon\\src\\necronomicon.csproj\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\nNone in the publish just nullable warnings\n\n### Further technical details\n<details><summary>details of dotnet --info</summary>\n<p>\n$ dotnet --info\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107\n Commit:            89c8f6a112\n Workload version:  10.0.100-rc.2.25513.4\n MSBuild version:   18.0.0-preview-25502-107+89c8f6a11\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     ubuntu\n OS Version:  24.04\n OS Platform: Linux\n RID:         ubuntu.24.04-x64\n Base Path:   /usr/lib/dotnet/sdk/10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [wasm-experimental]\n   Installation Source: SDK 10.0.100-rc.2\n   Manifest Version:    10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107/10.0.100-rc.2\n   Manifest Path:       /home/nick/.dotnet/sdk-manifests/10.0.100-rc.2/microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.current/10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107/WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:        FileBased\n\n [wasm-tools]\n   Installation Source: SDK 10.0.100-rc.2\n   Manifest Version:    10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107/10.0.100-rc.2\n   Manifest Path:       /home/nick/.dotnet/sdk-manifests/10.0.100-rc.2/microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.current/10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107/WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:        FileBased\n\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      10.0.0-rc.2.25502.107\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       89c8f6a112\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.111 [/usr/lib/dotnet/sdk]\n  10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107 [/usr/lib/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.10 [/usr/lib/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.0-rc.2.25502.107 [/usr/lib/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.10 [/usr/lib/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.0-rc.2.25502.107 [/usr/lib/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  None\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR           [/home/nick/.cache/dotnet_bundle_extract]\n  DOTNET_ROOT                              [/home/nick/dotnet]\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n</p>\n</details>\nVersion: 1.105.1\nCommit: 7d842fb85a0275a4a8e4d7e040d2625abbf7f084\nDate: 2025-10-14T22:33:36.618Z\nElectron: 37.6.0\nElectronBuildId: 12502201\nChromium: 138.0.7204.251\nNode.js: 22.19.0\nV8: 13.8.258.32-electron.0\nOS: Linux x64 6.14.0-35-generic snap\n\n[binlogs.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23430661/binlogs.zip)\n\nbasic screenshots:\n<details><summary>Windows publish folder</summary>\n<img width=\"751\" height=\"1197\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19754d74-ad0a-4b7a-bbd4-12307519a543\" />\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Linux publish folder</summary>\n<img width=\"352\" height=\"738\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/464eab09-a874-4942-a54d-925b1ac34d20\" />\n</details>","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51636","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"net10.0 rc2 publish for browser-wasm project is missing wasm artifacts in Linux that are present in Windows publish\" (#51636)"},{"Id":"3602561044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-08T02:03:58","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"51635","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0.1xx] Update dependencies from microsoft/testfx","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:7341e537-3641-49c3-ba77-2be9002e2f30)\n## From https://github.com/microsoft/testfx\n- **Subscription**: [7341e537-3641-49c3-ba77-2be9002e2f30](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=7341e537-3641-49c3-ba77-2be9002e2f30)\n- **Build**: [20251108.6](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2834264) ([290047](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/548/github:microsoft:testfx/build/290047))\n- **Date Produced**: November 8, 2025 12:43:25 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [7df896aeec9505a44371dbe0dd2712764d0ce0f6](https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/commit/7df896aeec9505a44371dbe0dd2712764d0ce0f6)\n- **Branch**: [main](https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/tree/main)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Dependency Updates**:\n  -

This allows dotnet-watch to reference only the parsing logic without pulling in implementation dependencies.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Pattern Applied\nEach of the 30+ command parsers now uses a two-file structure with independent, non-partial classes:\n\n1. **`*CommandDefinition.cs`** (parsing only - non-partial class)\n   - Contains options, arguments, command structure\n   - `Create()` method (public) creates and configures the command structure\n   - No `SetAction()` calls\n\n2. **`*CommandParser.cs`** (actions only - non-partial class)\n   - Contains `Command` field initialized with configured command\n   - `GetCommand()` returns the configured command\n   - Sets the action on the command via calling `*CommandDefinition.Create()`\n\n### Example\n\n**BuildCommandDefinition.cs** (parsing):\n```csharp\ninternal static class BuildCommandDefinition\n{\n    public static readonly string DocsLink = \"https://aka.ms/dotnet-build\";\n    public static readonly Option<string> OutputOption = ...;\n    // ... more options and arguments ...\n    \n    public static Command Create()\n    {\n        DocumentedCommand command = new(\"build\", DocsLink, CliCommandStrings.BuildAppFullName);\n        command.AddOption(OutputOption);\n        // ... add more options, arguments ...\n        return command;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**BuildCommandParser.cs** (actions):\n```csharp\ninternal static class BuildCommandParser\n{\n    private static readonly Command Command = CreateCommand();\n\n    public static Command GetCommand()\n    {\n        return Command;\n    }\n\n    private static Command CreateCommand()\n    {\n        var command = BuildCommandDefinition.Create();\n        command.SetAction(GetAction());\n        return command;\n    }\n\n    private static Func<ParseResult, int> GetAction()\n    {\n        return BuildCommand.Run;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Usage in other files**:\n```csharp\n// Access options, arguments from Definition class\nvar hasOption = parseResult.HasOption(BuildCommandDefinition.SelfContainedOption);\nvar slnArg = BuildCommandDefinition.SlnOrProjectOrFileArgument;\n\n// Get the configured command from Parser class\nvar command = BuildCommandParser.GetCommand();\n```\n\n### Changes Made\n\n- **Renamed 32 command parser classes** from `*CommandParser` to `*CommandDefinition`\n- **Renamed files** to match new class names (e.g., `BuildCommandParser.cs` → `BuildCommandDefinition.cs`)\n- **Renamed method** from `CreateCommandDefinition()` to `Create()`\n- **Created 32 new `*CommandParser.cs` files** containing the action configuration (previously had `.Actions.cs` suffix)\n- **Updated all 67 files** with references to use new class names:\n  - Parser files call `XxxCommandDefinition.Create()`\n  - Other files reference static members via `XxxCommandDefinition.*` (e.g., options, arguments)\n  - Public API remains `XxxCommandParser.GetCommand()`\n\n**Transformed command parsers:**\n- AddCommandDefinition/Parser, BuildCommandDefinition/Parser, BuildServerCommandDefinition/Parser, CleanCommandDefinition/Parser\n- CompleteCommandDefinition/Parser, DnxCommandDefinition/Parser, FormatCommandDefinition/Parser, FsiCommandDefinition/Parser\n- HelpCommandDefinition/Parser, InternalReportInstallSuccessCommandDefinition/Parser, ListCommandDefinition/Parser\n- MSBuildCommandDefinition/Parser, NewCommandDefinition/Parser, NuGetCommandDefinition/Parser, PackCommandDefinition/Parser\n- PackageCommandDefinition/Parser, ParseCommandDefinition/Parser, ProjectCommandDefinition/Parser, PublishCommandDefinition/Parser\n- ReferenceCommandDefinition/Parser, RemoveCommandDefinition/Parser, RestoreCommandDefinition/Parser, RunCommandDefinition/Parser\n- RunApiCommandDefinition/Parser, SdkCommandDefinition/Parser, SdkCheckCommandDefinition/Parser, SolutionCommandDefinition/Parser\n- StoreCommandDefinition/Parser, TestCommandDefinition/Parser, ToolCommandDefinition/Parser, VSTestCommandDefinition/Parser\n- WorkloadCommandDefinition/Parser\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Reduced Dependencies**: dotnet-watch can reference `*CommandDefinition` classes to get parsing logic without pulling in action dependencies\n- **Clear Naming**: \"Definition\" classes define command structure (options, arguments), \"Parser\" classes provide the public API\n- **Complete Separation**: Both Definition and Parser classes are now independent, non-partial classes\n- **No Partial Class Dependencies**: All classes are regular, non-partial classes with clear separation of concerns\n- **Clean File Names**: Parser files have simple names without `.Actions` suffix\n- **Backward Compatible**: Public API through `*CommandParser.GetCommand()` remains unchanged for external consumers\n- **Maintainable**: Clear distinction between definition (parsing logic with options/arguments) and interface (actions and command configuration)\n\n## Testing\n\n✅ All class definitions renamed and updated  \n✅ All file references updated to use new class names  \n✅ All `.Actions` suffixes removed from file names  \n✅ Build compiles successfully  \n✅ No partial class dependencies remain\n\n- Fixes dotnet/sdk#51623\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Separate command parsing from implementation</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>dotnet-watch is pulling in a lot of dependencies that it shouldn't be.

That's odd. It's because it's not _our_ `.gitignore`. We should develop a much shorter one. I don't have a concrete problem to share, however, I have this nagging feeling that these giant `.gitignore` files will eventually present a supply chain challenge. In general, developers should understand the files they are responsible for. I don't understand the implications of adding or removing most of the lines in this file.

Also add a test for this (running a simple app; clearing nuget cache; changing .cs file; rerunning again - should fail without the fix - the app in this test doesn't even need to reference packages because there are some referenced implicitly due to PublishAot=true being the default; but if that ever changes consider adding also a test where we specifically reference some package and it can have PublishAot=false).</agent_instructions>\r\n> \r\n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\r\n> \r\n> <comments>\r\n> <comment_new><author>@jjonescz</author><body>\r\n> Thanks for reporting this. There is an optimization to recompile using C# compiler only (skipping MSBuild, so also restore) on subsequent re-runs of file-based apps. You can force full recompilation using `dotnet run app.cs --no-cache` (or `dotnet build app.cs`).\r\n> \r\n> I don't think the NuGet command can reliably find and clear the file-based app cache. Instead, the optimization logic could check that the referenced DLLs still exist and fallback to full build if not (we could also do that only if the optimized compilation fails; to not slow down the fast path).</body></comment_new>\r\n> </comments>\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- Fixes dotnet/sdk#51597\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\r\n---\r\n\r\n💬 We'd love your input!

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

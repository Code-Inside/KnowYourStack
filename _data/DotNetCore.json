More background/details below:\n\n## Background\n\nThe previous state of affairs, was causing frequent unwanted restore popups, because (1) is a condition which changes \"ambiently\" over time. When the workspace is first opened, the projects aren't loaded yet. When files are created or moved, the project needs to be design-time built in order to realize the file is part of a project. And so on.\n\nUsing a single canonical misc project instead, allows us to avoid the unwanted restore popups (including the one for Canonical.cs itself in #81233), as well as unwanted artifacts appearing in the user's repo under certain conditions, while continuing to provide the \"rich misc files\" experience, including semantic errors, completions and Quick Info for the core library.\n\n---\n\nThe case that remains, where unwanted restore popups can still occur, is the following, where there are no `#!`/`#:` directives at all, yet the file is part of an ordinary project:\n\n```cs\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n```\n\nWith the proposed change to delete the \"no top-level statements\" condition above, this file is never treated as a file-based app by the editor. It will never be restored as a file-based app. Rather it just gets errors/completions/classification/etc for the standard library.\n\nEssentially, the above sample can *only* ever be *either* a misc file, or, part of an ordinary project.\n\nIn order to actually treat the above as a file-based app in the editor, the user will need to do something like the following:\n\n```cs\n#!/usr/bin/env dotnet\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");\n```\n\nOR\n\n```cs\n#:sdk Microsoft.Net.Sdk // or ANY #: directive\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");\n```\n\nI want the presence of the directive(s) to serve as a signal for both the IDE and the reader, that this is affirmatively meant to be a file-based app, before we start restoring it.\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"4822520572","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T02:06:54","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":"Opened

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

The file has a non-absolute path and we shouldn't try to use its containing directory as a base for path lookup.\r\n\r\nUsually just the combination of: document is not part of an ordinary project, and document contains this directive, would make it be treated as an ordinary file. But there is also the case of virtual documents (not present on disk), containing these directives, e.g. when you hit `ctrl+N` in VS Code, set language mode to C# and start typing. Virtual documents are never treated as file-based programs, they are essentially only treated as miscellaneous files. But the user might be intending for this to be a file-based program, once they have saved it to disk. So reporting an error in this case is much more a nuisance than a benefit.\r\n\r\nI also added a separate Features value to indicate that a file is a MiscellaneousFile, which I thought might be useful in contrast to something being labeled a FileBasedProgram. I'm a bit uncertain about this. As-is, directive errors are not going to be reported in such virtual documents, and it's not clear to me whether that's good or bad. At the least I think testing would be required before we go ahead with such directives since the code which reports the diagnostics may expect the file to have an on-disk path.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81385","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Do not report parse errors for '#:' in miscellaneous files\" (#81385)"},{"Id":"3649677797","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T00:24:27","Actor":"ToddGrun","Number":"81384","RawContent":null,"Title":"17.12 ComponentGovernance update for MessagePack package","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81384","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"17.12 ComponentGovernance update for MessagePack package\" (#81384)"},{"Id":"3649617165","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T23:54:58","Actor":"bradselw","Number":"81383","RawContent":null,"Title":"Refactoring Integration Test stage into a template","State":"open","Body":"Refactoring the inline test stage in azure-pipelines-integration-dartlab.yml into a template to enable reuse in Visual Studio test gates.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81383","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Refactoring Integration Test stage into a template\" (#81383)"},{"Id":"3649301728","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T22:07:31","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"81382","RawContent":null,"Title":"Register encoding provider when `GetEncoding` throws `NotSupportedException`","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #81381","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81382","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Register encoding provider when `GetEncoding` throws `NotSupportedException`\" (#81382)"},{"Id":"3649249580","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T21:53:30","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"81381","RawContent":null,"Title":"After installing VS2026 all Builds fail with CSC : error CS2016: Code page '1252' is invalid or not installed","State":"open","Body":"Created from https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/2642554\n\n_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/After-installing-VS2026-all-Builds-fail-/11002963)._\n\n---\n[severity:I'm unable to use this version] [regression] [worked-in:2022]\nWe have a codebase that has &lt;CodePage&gt;1252&lt;/CodePage&gt; set in all .NET-Projects.

Analysis Rules to Roslyn","State":"open","Body":"<!-- This issue template is **only** for analyzers related to code style. -->\n<!-- To propose a semantic/code quality analyzer, please follow the guidelines at https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/main/GuidelinesForNewRules.md. -->\n\n**Brief description:**\nIn current C# development practices, exception handling often relies on developer discipline and team conventions, lacking enforcement from the compiler and static analysis tools. This frequently leads to critical production failures due to unhandled exceptions.\n\nThe recent Cloudflare global service outage serves as a prime example. Their [Rust component panicked due to `unwrap()` usage](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/), rendering core services unavailable. While C# uses a different error handling model, similar issues exist: developers may throw exceptions without proper documentation, and callers may fail to handle known exception scenarios.\n\nPropose a set of code style analyzers to enforce robust exception handling practices by requiring proper documentation of thrown exceptions and validation of exception handling at call sites. These rules aim to prevent production failures like the recent Cloudflare incident caused by inadequate error handling.\n\n**Languages applicable:**\n\nc#\n\n**Code example that the analyzer should report:**\n\n Rule EX001: Missing exception documentation for public method with throw statements\n\n```csharp\n\n// ❌ Violates rule - throws exception but not documented\npublic string LoadConfiguration(string path)\n{\n    if (!File.Exists(path))\n        throw new FileNotFoundException(); // EX001: Missing exception documentation\n    \n    return File.ReadAllText(path);\n}\n\n// ✅ Compliant\n/// <summary>Loads configuration file</summary>\n/// <exception cref=\"FileNotFoundException\">Thrown when configuration file doesn't exist</exception>\npublic string LoadConfiguration(string path)\n{\n    if (!File.Exists(path))\n        throw new FileNotFoundException();\n    \n    return File.ReadAllText(path);\n}\n```\n\nRule EX002: Require that when calling methods with documented exceptions, the caller must explicitly handle these exceptions.\n```csharp\n// ❌ Violates rule - doesn't handle documented exceptions\npublic void InitializeService()\n{\n    var config = LoadConfiguration(\"app.config\"); // EX003: Unhandled documented exception\n    // If LoadConfiguration throws FileNotFoundException, this will crash\n}\n\n// ✅ Compliant\npublic void InitializeService()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        var config = LoadConfiguration(\"app.config\");\n    }\n    catch (FileNotFoundException ex)\n    {\n        // Provide fallback\n        UseDefaultConfiguration();\n        Logger.Warning(ex, \"Config file missing, using defaults\");\n    }\n    catch (UnauthorizedAccessException ex)\n    {\n        // Or rethrow\n        throw new ServiceInitializationException(\"Cannot access config file\", ex);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Additional information:**\n\nExpected Benefits\n - Improved Code Reliability: Enforces explicit exception handling, reducing production crashes\n\n - Better Developer Experience: Catches exception handling issues at compile time rather than runtime\n\n - Promotes API Design: Encourages designing APIs with clear error contracts\n\n - Facilitates Code Review: Makes exception handling a verifiable code quality metric\n\nThe Cloudflare incident reminds us that modern software systems require stronger error handling guarantees. By adding exception handling analysis rules to Roslyn, we can significantly improve the robustness of C# applications while maintaining the language's flexibility and development efficiency.\n\nThese rules would help developers establish proper exception handling habits during the coding phase, preventing recurrences of incidents like Cloudflare's.\n\n**Documentation requirements:**\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/81371","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Exception Handling Robustness Analysis Rules to Roslyn\" (#81371)"},{"Id":"3646515037","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T10:12:55","Actor":"AlexanderEgurtsovDX","Number":"81369","RawContent":null,"Title":"Document.GetOptionsAsync returns wrong TabSize for VB document","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: \nVS Insiders(2026)\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n1.

If an error isn't directly in the element/branch, e.g. if I change collection expression to `[new(a), default]` even though the first element still contains an error, types start to flow through, so I get correct type information both on `new` and `default`. The same applies to other examples as well.\n\nThere is theoretical IDE impact, but I believe it is extreamly rare to see it in practical applications","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/81365","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Target-typed expressions with nested elements/branches don't get converted when one of nested expressions is directly an error\" (#81365)"},{"Id":"3645449915","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T04:54:39","Actor":"JoeRobich","Number":"81362","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add PME override for manual builds","State":"open","Body":"Backport of #81355","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81362","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add PME override for manual builds\" (#81362)"},{"Id":"3645093478","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T04:06:12","Actor":"ToddGrun","Number":"81359","RawContent":null,"Title":"Another round of ComponentGovernance fixes for 17.12","State":"closed","Body":"Not sure why the last round didn't have me update the MSBuild ones directly to these suggested versions.

Mutex has a 5-minute timeout with clear error messaging. Implements two-stage acquisition: quick 50ms check followed by user notification if waiting is required.\n\n- **CliStrings.resx**: Add `ToolInstallationTimeout` error message for mutex timeout scenarios and `ToolInstallationWaiting` message to inform users when waiting for concurrent installations.\n\n- **ToolPackageDownloaderTests.cs**: Add `GivenConcurrentInstallationsTheyDoNotConflict` test verifying no file access conflicts occur during concurrent installations.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe mutex protects the critical section from package existence check through download, extraction, and asset file creation. Tool execution remains outside the mutex. RID-specific packages are also protected.\n\n## User Experience\n\nWhen a concurrent installation is detected, users are immediately informed with:\n> \"Another installation of tool '{packageId}' version '{version}' is in progress. Waiting for it to complete... (Press Ctrl+C to cancel)\"\n\nThis provides transparency about what's happening and allows users to cancel if desired.\n\n```csharp\nprotected void DownloadTool(...)\n{\n    string mutexName = GetToolInstallMutexName(packageId, packageVersion);\n    using var mutex = new Mutex(false, mutexName);\n    \n    try\n    {\n        // Quick check (50ms) for immediate availability\n        if (!mutex.WaitOne(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(50)))\n        {\n            // Inform user and wait for full duration\n            Reporter.Error.WriteLine(...);\n            if (!mutex.WaitOne(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)))\n                throw new ToolPackageException(...);\n        }\n            \n        // Check, download, extract - all serialized per package version\n    }\n    finally\n    {\n        mutex.ReleaseMutex();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFixes dotnet/sdk#51831\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Concurrent Tool Installation can fail</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Describe the bug\n> \n> If you try and install the same tool concurrently (in either `dnx` or `dotnet tool install`), the separate instances fight each other and may hit file concurrency issues.\n> \n> In dotnet/aspire#13077 @baronfel suggested\n> > We probably should have some kind of named mutex for serializing the parts of that process that are file-manager-y.\n> \n> ### To Reproduce\n> \n> Try and run/install a tool multiple times concurrently.\n> ```pwsh\n> dotnet nuget locals all --clear\n> 1..10 |% -Parallel { dotnet tool exec dotnet-ef  -- --version} \n> ```\n> or\n> ```pwsh\n> dotnet nuget locals all --clear\n> 1..10 |% -Parallel { dotnet tool install dotnet-ef }\n> ```\n> \n> ### Exceptions (if any)\n> > Unhandled exception: The process cannot access the file 'S:\\_packages\\nuget\\dotnet-ef\\10.0.0\\dotnet-ef.10.0.0.nupkg' because it is being used by another process.\n> \n> ### Further technical details\n> <details><summary>details of dotnet --info</summary>\n> <p>\n> .NET SDK:\n>  Version:           10.0.100\n>  Commit:            b0f34d51fc\n>  Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.355811b7\n>  MSBuild version:   18.0.2+b0f34d51f\n> \n> Runtime Environment:\n>  OS Name:     Windows\n>  OS Version:  10.0.26100\n>  OS Platform: Windows\n>  RID:         win-x64\n>  Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100\\\n> \n> .NET workloads installed:\n> There are no installed workloads to display.\n> Configured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\n> No workload sets are installed.

This mostly helps avoid usages of 'Always' in cases where timestamp check is not sufficient (e.g. some version control systems reverts or build/publish outputs actually being used and altered during debugging).\n\nWithout complementing change in sdk, we would have confusing mix of the metadata being supported just in some cases. Also we cannot expose it in VS (as it possibly could lead to edits that wouldn't be fully supported down the road) - which limits disccoverability:\n\n<img width=\"818\" height=\"260\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3ffc563-b118-4dcf-add9-4c3da06a0b6a\" />\n\n#### Why do we want IfDifferent?\nTo stear users from usages of 'Always' copy metdata - as that is one of the main factors preventing incrementality of builds\n\n#### Alternatives?\nMentioned MSBuild PR introduced opt-in mechanism to flip copy-always behavior to if-different behavior - via setting $(SkipUnchangedFilesOnCopyAlways) property. So we can start start setting it for projects targetting newer TFMs. But again it'd be helpful to have complementing change in sdk as well.\n\n\n\n### What is suggested to be done\n\n - [ ] Revisit all instances of logic that splits items based on CopyToOutputDirectory/CopyToPublishDirectory/Copy... metadata values - to account for the 'IfDifferent' value\n - [ ] Revisit the usages of the logic where we set the value of metadata - if we should actualy replace instances of 'PreserveNewest' with 'IfDifferent'","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51829","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Audit usages of PreserveNewest/Always metadata to ensure support for IfDifferent\" (#51829)"},{"Id":"3646033998","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-20T18:22:29","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"51821","RawContent":null,"Title":"[dnceng-bot] Branch `sdk/release/8.0.3xx` can't be merged to Azdo internal branch","State":"closed","Body":"Branch [release/8.0.3xx](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/commits/release/8.0.3xx/) in `dotnet/sdk` repo can't be mirrored from GitHub to Azure [internal/release/8.0.3xx](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-sdk?version=GBinternal%2Frelease%2F8.0.3xx&_a=history) via internal merge. \n\nThere are conflicting commits in the target branch.\nThe branch is configured to be mirrored via automated merge. \nThe situation is rare but normal.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.3  Runtime or .NET 9.0.103 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

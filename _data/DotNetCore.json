The solution contains many projects, some referenced through normal project-to-project references and others referenced as DLLs.\n\nVisual Studio frequently loses IntelliSense cohesion: large portions of the solution suddenly show red squiggles with errors that do not make sense. Although this often happens after switching Git branches (either inside Visual Studio or via the command line), it also occurs at times *without* any branch switching or external source-control activity.\n\nA typical example of the incorrect errors I see is:\n\n```\nCS0518: Predefined type 'System.Void' is not defined or imported\n```\n\nDespite these errors, the solution builds successfully, and none of the IntelliSense-reported issues are real.\n\nThe only reliable workaround I have found is:\n\n1. Exit Visual Studio\n2. Delete the `.vs` folder\n3. Build the solution outside Visual Studio (MSBuild or `dotnet build`)\n4. Reopen Visual Studio\n\nThis resolves the problem temporarily, but it recurs, with or without branch switches.\n\nScreenshot of the behavior:\n\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=B672da911b2054edf99629ac7a7459748639010353124737725_20251211-093511-image.png\\&tid=672da911b2054edf99629ac7a7459748639010353124737725)\n\n**Environment details:**\n\n* Visual Studio version: 2026 18.1.0\n* Project type: .NET Framework \n* Repo characteristics: large, multi-project solution\n* Frequency: mutliple times a day, occurs both after branch switches and during normal editing sessions with no branch changes\n* In vs 2022 this almost never happenened\n\nThis appears to be an IntelliSense cache invalidation or design-time build consistency issue.\n\nVS info:\n```\nVisual C++ 2026   00487-30000-00000-AA092\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 2026\n\nASP.NET and Web Tools   18.0.333.805\nASP.NET and Web Tools\n\nAzure App Service Tools v3.0.0   18.0.333.805\nAzure App Service Tools v3.0.0\n\nAzure Functions and Web Jobs Tools   18.0.333.805\nAzure Functions and Web Jobs Tools\n\nC# Tools   5.0.0-2.25574.6+7f327e02b43a2486faa9cfdf0a1eae34c06e2d1a\nC# components used in the IDE.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key.

fixers","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds a new IDE/code-style layer analyzer for detecting when an `async` method/lambda contains no `await`s and thus can be  made synchronous (and no longer task-returning).  This previously existed, but was removed when we removed the reporting of CS1998 in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80144.\r\n\r\nThe reason to add this back in is that it can still be useful for users to know when they have made a method asynchronous *unintentionally*.  For example, if it at one point had an `async` call, but then the last `async` call was removed.  In that case, the method could be made entirely synchronous, potentially virally, making a large swath of a component that was previously async, sync.  \r\n\r\nThe analyzer is NOT enabled by default.  It can be opted into by users who liked having CS1998 catch and notify them when they no longer needed tasks at all. \r\n\r\nThere are places though where this sort of notification may be undesirable.  For example, it is common to have task-returning methods in interfaces or as virtual methods in base classes.  Implementations of these methods need to stay task-returning to abide by their contract.  Because of this, instead of having a single diagnostic ID controlling this, we have two:\r\n\r\n1. IDE0390.  Reports on normal methods and lambdas.\r\n2. IDE0391. Reports on methods that are interface-impls or overrides.\r\n\r\nUsers who want to strictly avoid unnecessary task-returning methods in all cases can enable both.  Users that just want to know for the standard case, but need to keep tasks for interface/overrides, can just enable the first.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNote: teh codefixprovider was just brought back from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80144, as were the tests.  The tests were updated to use the new diagnostic id.  and new tests were added to validate that we now have two distinct diagnostic IDs.

event-specific diagnostic without 'required' suggestion","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n- This PR fixes incorrect guidance in the CS8618 warning when applied to **events**.\r\n\r\nWhen a non-nullable event is not initialized in the constructor, the compiler\r\ncurrently reports CS8618 and suggests adding the `required` modifier.\r\n\r\nHowever, events cannot be marked `required`, and doing so produces:\r\n```\r\nCS0106: The modifier 'required' is not valid for this item\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in misleading guidance for users.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a new diagnostic that is used specifically for events,\r\nwith corrected wording that does **not** suggest the `required` modifier.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Behavior Before vs After\r\n\r\n| Member kind       | Diagnostic | Guidance |\r\n|------------------|---------|---------|\r\n| Field / Property | CS8618 (`WRN_UninitializedNonNullableField`) | may suggest `required` |\r\n| Event            | **New diagnostic** (`ERR_NonNullableEventNotInitialized`) | suggests initializing or making nullable — no `required` |\r\n\r\nThe new event-specific message now states:\r\n\r\n> \"Consider declaring the event as nullable or initializing it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n✔️ Added new diagnostic ID in `ErrorCode.cs`  \r\n✔️ Added corresponding resource entry in `CSharpResources.resx`  \r\n✔️ Updated `NullableWalker` to:\r\n\r\n- continue emitting CS8618 for fields + properties\r\n- emit the new diagnostic for `SymbolKind.Event`\r\n\r\nNo existing diagnostic IDs were renumbered or modified.\r\n\r\nNullable analysis behavior is unchanged — only message guidance differs.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nEvents cannot use the `required` modifier, so referencing it in

expect no warnings","State":"closed","Body":"## Issue:\r\n- When using extension types with a nullable receiver (e.g., object?), the compiler was incorrectly inferring the type parameter as non-nullable. This resulted in false positive CS8625: Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type warnings when assigning null to properties defined within the extension type, as the property type was treated as non-nullable.\r\n## Fix:\r\n- This PR ensures that type inference for extension types correctly propagates nullability from the receiver to the type arguments. Specifically, when the receiver is a nullable reference type, the inferred type argument is now also nullable. This allows properties of that type to correctly accept null values without generating warnings.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n- Added regression test Nullability_PropertyAccess_07 to src/Compilers/CSharp/Test/Emit/Emit/CompilationEmitTests.cs.\r\n- The test asserts that the following scenario compiles with no diagnostics:\r\n```\r\n#nullable enable\r\nobject? oNotNull = new object();\r\noNotNull.P = null; // Should not warn\r\n\r\nstatic class E\r\n{\r\n    extension<T>(T t)\r\n    {\r\n        public T P { set => throw null!; }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Related:\r\nRelates to test plan #76130\r\n\r\ncloses #81824 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81825","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix: Nullability_PropertyAccess_07 test to expect no warnings\" (#81825)"},{"Id":"3773929690","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-01T00:12:26","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"81829","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-11331.49","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/f511fcb6e9a166980340a6dbcffef48a2a4caf47...635d2b812121ef9fafe0de223b09be64e5a4a291?w=1)\n- [Let Razor fill in project information on diagnostics](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81822)\n- [Move to async/await (Features) layer](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81810)\n- [Enable GetTypeInfo for type of object creation syntax](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81802)\n- [Improve error recovery around 'scoped' modifier parsing](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81636)\n- [Move to async/await (VisualStudio) layer ](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81813)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/81829","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-11331.49\" (#81829)"},{"Id":"3773305976","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-31T18:22:38","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"81827","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move lsp handlers to async/await.","State":"open","Body":"Build: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=13025692&view=results\r\nPR: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/697744","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81827","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Move lsp handlers to async/await.\" (#81827)"},{"Id":"3770938440","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-31T17:59:56","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"81819","RawContent":null,"Title":"[VS2026] Codelens does not appear/work for extension methods with new C#14 keyword","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/VS2026-Codelens-does-not-appearwork-f/10988233)._\n\n---\nDO NOT resolve as a duplicate of [Roslyn GitHub issue 79006](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79006)\nDO NOT resolve as a duplicate of [VS issue 10919273](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/The-new-c14-extension-member-function-d/10919273)\n\nI've already been down that road and it was met with poor customer consideration.\n\nCode lens for .NET (C# specifically, but probably other .NET languages) does not appear for methods, properties, etc... that are contained within a C#14 `extension()` section.\n\nExample:\n``` C#\nnamespace Bug\n{\n    // Code lens information for the class as a whole appears here\n    internal static class BugReportSample\n    {\n        extension(string self)\n        {\n            // Code lens information for this (or any other extension) does NOT appear here\n            [System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage( \"Performance\", \"CA1822:Mark members as static\", Justification = \"Bogus a different bug\" )]\n            internal int SampleExtension()\n            {\n                return self.Length;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n![Screenshot 2025-10-22 174548.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=B7ff27e5be54a427fb28b4d7f3747f1b1638968356536195393_Screenshot_2025-10-22_174548.png&tid=7ff27e5be54a427fb28b4d7f3747f1b1638968356536195393)\n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 10/23/2025, 10:26 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

It has two Blazor Server app projects, and five Class Library projects.

It's quite annoying.\n\nThe fact that this issue doesn't happen with my other larger solution makes me suggest there's something wrong with Razor support, even when I don't have any `.razor` file opened or edited during my whole user session.\n\n**Please find in attachment a 16 GB memory dump of `ServiceHub.RoslynCodeAnalysisService.exe` for investigation.**\n\n_PS: I noticed many feedback ticket are similar to mine, particularly this one: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/ServiceHubRoslynCodeAnalysisServiceexe/10986518 ; I tried telling in Dev Community that my feedback was similar and therefore just put the text above as a comment to this existing feedback, but the website crashed when I tried so._\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 12/28/2025, 08:53 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

ASP.NET Core Static Web Assets in Razor Class Libraries.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using TypeScript with Static Web Assets in RCLs, rebuild operations fail because:\r\n\r\n1. **Timing issue**: TypeScript compilation runs during the Compile phase, AFTER Static Web Assets discovery has already occurred\r\n2. **Stale references**: During Clean, TypeScript targets delete the `.js` files, but `Content` items (added by Razor SDK globbing) persist in memory\r\n3. **Build failure**: `DefineStaticWebAssets` then fails because it finds `Content` items referencing files that no longer exist\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.TypeScript.targets` which:\r\n\r\n- **Hooks into `ResolveStaticWebAssetsInputsDependsOn`** to register TypeScript outputs AFTER compilation\r\n- **Removes TypeScript outputs from `Content`** before `CoreClean` and `ResolveProjectStaticWebAssets` to prevent stale item references\r\n- **Uses `DefineStaticWebAssets`/`DefineStaticWebAssetEndpoints`** for proper integration with compression, fingerprinting, and manifest generation\r\n- **Creates a manifest file** (`staticwebassets.typescript.files.txt`) to track registered assets across builds\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n| File | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.TypeScript.targets` | New targets file with TypeScript integration logic |\r\n| `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.targets` | Added conditional import when

However, TypeScript compilation runs during the `Compile` phase, **after** Static Web Assets discovery has already occurred.\n\nThis creates two problems:\n\n1. **Clean build**: TypeScript outputs are not discovered as static web assets because they don't exist yet when `ResolveProjectStaticWebAssets` runs. The files only appear to work during development due to a runtime fallback that serves files added after build-time discovery.\n\n2. **Rebuild**: The Razor SDK's default globbing automatically includes `wwwroot` files as `Content` items. During Clean, the TypeScript targets delete the `.js` files, but the `Content` items persist in memory. When Build runs, `DefineStaticWebAssets` fails because it finds `Content` items referencing files that no longer exist:\n\n```\nerror : The static web asset 'wwwroot\\MyScript.js' has source type 'Discovered' and is required \nto exist on disk at 'D:\\MyProject\\wwwroot\\MyScript.js', but the file does not exist.\n```\n\nThe TypeScript package does not coordinate with the Static Web Assets system to properly register its outputs or clean up `Content` item references when its outputs are deleted.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a new targets file `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.TypeScript.targets` that:\n\n1. Hooks into `ResolveStaticWebAssetsInputsDependsOn` to register TypeScript outputs as static web assets **after** compilation\n2. Removes TypeScript outputs from `Content` before `CoreClean` and `ResolveProjectStaticWebAssets` to prevent stale item references\n\nThe targets file should be conditionally imported when `EnableTypeScriptNuGetTarget='true'` (property set by the `Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild` NuGet package).\n\n### Affected Scenarios\n\n| Scenario | Status |\n|----------|--------|\n| Clean build | ⚠️ Assets not properly discovered (works only via dev fallback) |\n| Rebuild | ❌ Fails |\n| Incremental build after modifying .ts | ❌ May fail |\n| Clean followed by build | ❌ May fail |\n| Publish | ⚠️ Assets may be missing or incorrectly processed |\n\n### Related\n\nThis follows the same integration pattern as:\n- `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.JSModules.targets`\n- `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.StaticWebAssets.ScopedCss.targets`","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52301","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Static Web Assets integration for Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild NuGet package\" (#52301)"},{"Id":"3774042029","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-01T02:43:18","Actor":"skyoxZ","Number":"52300","RawContent":null,"Title":"A dedicated file extension for file-based app","State":"open","Body":"`dotnet [run] app.cs` is a great feature that makes it possible to write and run C# code like a script.

noise","State":"open","Body":"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\nIf you run `dotnet test` in MTP mode with an invalid argument, whilst you do get a clear error message at the top, you then get hundreds of lines (int he case of xunit over 700 lines) after it, which does a great job of hiding the error\n\nFor example, if you run `dotnet test --show-live-output true` for an xunit test app, you'll get the following output:\n```\nartifacts\\bin\\SharedAppHost\\debug\\SharedAppHost.dll (net10.0) Zero tests ran\nExit code: 5\n  Standard output: xUnit.net v3 Microsoft.Testing.Platform v2 Runner v3.2.1+a9cfb80929 (64-bit .NET 10.0.1)\n\n  Option '--show-live-output' has invalid arguments: Invalid value 'true' (must be one of: 'on', 'off')\n  Usage SharedAppHost.exe [option providers] [extension option providers]\n\n  Execute a .NET Test Application.\n\n  Options:\n      --config-file\n          Specifies a testconfig.json file.\n\n...<SNIP> - 700 more lines </SNIP>...\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWhilst the error message as a whole is clear, it is followed by hundreds of lines of noise, and it can take quite a lot of scrolling to find the original error.  And in a longer console session, you can easily scroll right past it).\n\nI can think of three ideas that would help make these errors easier to spot:\n\n1. Repeat the actual error at the very end of the `dotnet test --help` output so it shows as the last line(s) of output.\n2. When an error relates to a known argument (in this case `--show-live-output`), print just the help output for that argument - i.e. something like:\n    ```\n    Option '--show-live-output' has invalid arguments: Invalid value 'true' (must be one of: 'on', 'off')\n\n      --show-live-output\n          Determine whether to show test output (from ITestOutputHelper) live during test execution.\n              on  - turn on live reporting of test output\n              off - turn off live reporting of test output [default]\n    ```\n3. Don't print the output of `dotnet test --help` at all, and just print a singe line error along the lines of `Run \"dotnet test --help\" for more details on arguments\"\n\n### Additional context\nFor full context, the full output from `dotnet test --show-live-output true`.

This is a non-deterministic error, which randomly occurs (only some builds throw this runtime exception, other builds for same code work totally fine)\n2. When compared an erroneous artifact with a correct artifact, noticed that number of libraries in `platform_jjz_service_api.deps.json` is lesser in erroneous artifact.\n3. Changed the dotnet commands slightly to publish the release artifact, but no luck there : \n```\n  dotnet nuget locals all --clear\n  dotnet restore --locked-mode\n  dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained false -o ./publish\n```\n\n### Known Workarounds\nKeep re-deploying the same code mutiple times, eventually in one of the deployments, this issue goes away","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52294","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Non-Deterministic missing libraries in artifacts for same codebase (no changes)\" (#52294)"},{"Id":"3767131999","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-29T10:13:14","Actor":"Susie-1989","Number":"52293","RawContent":null,"Title":"The browser is stuck with error \"WebSocket connection to 'wss://localhost:65041/' failed:\" after dotnet watch for Blazor Web App ~ Server ~Global","State":"open","Body":"**REGRESSION INFO**: Repro on 9.0.308\n\n**INSTALL STEPS**\n\n1.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

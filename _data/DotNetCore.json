See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's different?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!"},{"Id":"49679107858","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:27","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/358","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET 10 Preview 4\" (#358) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

not reproduce with .NET SDK 8.0.408. It also does not reproduce if Mono is not installed, although an additional warning message is emitted starting with .NET SDK 8.0.409:\n\n```\n[Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.MSBuild.BuildHostProcessManager] An installation of Mono could not be found; /opt/work/helloworld.csproj will be loaded with the .NET Core SDK and may encounter errors.\n```\n\nIt appears that the `dotnet format` command has worked with this older .csproj syntax ([example](https://github.com/DynamicDevices/mono-helloworld/blob/master/mono-helloworld.csproj)) up until now, although I'm not sure if it's expected to work against a .csproj that wasn't created by `dotnet new` and if it's considered a bug that it no longer works. At the very least, I'd say it's a bug that it outputs a stack trace instead of an error message.\n\n### To Reproduce\n1. Create a `Dockerfile` file with the following contents:\n\n```Dockerfile\nARG DOTNET_SDK_VERSION=8.0.409\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:${DOTNET_SDK_VERSION}-jammy-amd64\n\n# Install Mono\nARG WITHOUT_MONO\nRUN if [ -z \"$WITHOUT_MONO\" ]; then \\\n    apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y gnupg && \\\n    apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF && \\\n    echo \"deb https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu stable-focal main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-official-stable.list && \\\n    apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y mono-complete ; \\\n    fi\n\n# Run dotnet format (with a minimal MSBuild project file)\n# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/walkthrough-creating-an-msbuild-project-file-from-scratch?view=vs-2022#create-a-minimal-msbuild-project-file\nWORKDIR /opt/work\nRUN cat > helloworld.csproj <<EOF\n<Project>\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <Compile Include=\"helloworld.cs\"/>\n  </ItemGroup>\n  <Target Name=\"Build\">\n    <Csc Sources=\"@(Compile)\"/>\n  </Target>\n</Project>\nEOF\nRUN cat > helloworld.cs <<EOF\nusing System;\n\nclass HelloWorld\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\"); // bad indentation\n    }\n}\nEOF\nRUN bash <<EOF\nset -x\ndotnet --info\ndotnet format helloworld.csproj -v diag\necho \"dotnet exit status: \\$?\"\ncat helloworld.cs\nfalse\nEOF\n```\n\n2.

That's currently a difficult question to answer for self-contained apps since the SDK contains a set of very critical version numbers. It should be trivial to find out what those are via the CLI. We should also document them in release notes.\n\nLet's assume there is a very critical runtime CVE. Clearly, everyone should update their runtimes and SDKs everywhere and then everything is solved. However, for users that deploy their apps as FDD, the primary concern is the prod environment. For folks deploying as self-contained, then the build machine not prod becomes critical.\n\nI can easily imagine some users being quite serious about prod server compliance and taking a more pedestrian approach to build servers while not fully internalizing that they deploy some of their prod apps as self-contained. Doing the \"right thing\" for the prod environment might in some cases be providing a false sense of safety.\n\nIt should be possible to build an experience where we provide a greater set of alerts for people using old SDKs and publishing as self-contained or (more importantly) for users to self-diagnose that they have a problem to resolve.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49198","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide information on the self-contained target versions\" (#49198)"},{"Id":"3100415919","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T13:47:41","Actor":"Kuinox","Number":"49197","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reduce `dotnet run` start time overhead","State":"open","Body":"With the new `dotnet run app.cs` the dotnet cli now become the biggest overhead in tons of scripting scenarios with dotnet.  \nSimply summoning a hello world takes more than half a second:  \n\n```\nMeasure-Command { dotnet run --no-build }\nTotalMilliseconds : 607.9708\n```\nI believe this is a major blocker for devs who want a lightweight scripting tool.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49197","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reduce `dotnet run` start time overhead\" (#49197)"},{"Id":"3097878337","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T12:57:05","Actor":"maraf","Number":"49183","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Disable custom cache in .NET 10","State":"closed","Body":"Disable custom cache in .NET 10 as we plan to completely remove it.\r\n\r\nContributes to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/85775 and is required by https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/114901","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49183","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[Blazor] Disable custom cache in .NET 10\" (#49183)"},{"Id":"3098947535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T06:16:17","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"49191","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from microsoft/testfx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:91043ec4-cb05-4190-931d-16d6d3e461e4)\n## From https://github.com/microsoft/testfx\n- **Subscription**: [91043ec4-cb05-4190-931d-16d6d3e461e4](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=91043ec4-cb05-4190-931d-16d6d3e461e4)\n- **Build**: [20250528.2](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2718412)\n- **Date Produced**: May 28, 2025 9:47:16 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: [892bce4ecb01a5d72168b6f153133551d7e1654b](https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/commit/892bce4ecb01a5d72168b6f153133551d7e1654b)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - **Microsoft.Testing.Platform**: [from 1.8.0-preview.25277.4 to 1.8.0-preview.25278.2][1]\n  - **MSTest**: [from 3.10.0-preview.25277.4 to 3.10.0-preview.25278.2][1]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/compare/77c0915dfc...892bce4ecb\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:91043ec4-cb05-4190-931d-16d6d3e461e4)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49191","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from microsoft/testfx\" (#49191)"},{"Id":"3099302400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T06:13:12","Actor":"v-wuzhai","Number":"49194","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support Helix testing on CentOS Stream 9","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49194","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support Helix testing on CentOS Stream 9\" (#49194)"},{"Id":"3099275415","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T06:00:28","Actor":"egvijayanand","Number":"49193","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Feature] Proposing an option to include other C# source files for `dotnet run app.cs`","State":"open","Body":"### Is your feature request related to a problem?

Migrating to `dotnet run Build.cs` seems like a perfect use case for this new .NET 10 feature.\n\nWe always want our build tooling to use the latest package version, so we use a floating `1.*` version in the `<PackageReference>`. However, we also use central package management, so we use a `VersionOverride` attribute in the csproj (because central package management doesn't support floating versions).\n\nI can't figure out an ideal way to support this with `dotnet run Build.cs`.\n\n## Current Situation\n\n#### Directory.Package.props\n\n```xml\n<Project>\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <!-- all non-Build packages here -->\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n#### tools\\Build\\Build.csproj\n\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Example.BuildTools\" VersionOverride=\"1.*\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n#### tools\\Build\\Build.cs\n\n```csharp\nreturn BuildRunner.Execute(args,  ...);\n```\n\n## Attempted Approaches\n\nIn all approaches, I have deleted `Build.csproj`.\n\n#### Floating #:package Version\n\n`Directory.Packages.props` as above, `Build.cs`:\n\n```csharp\n#:package Example.BuildTools@1.*\n\nreturn BuildRunner.Execute(args, ...);\n```\n\nError:\n\n```\ntools\\Build\\Build.csproj : error NU1008: Projects that use central package version management should not define the version on the PackageReference items but on the PackageVersion items: Example.BuildTools.\nDone building project \"Build.csproj\" -- FAILED.\n```\n\n#### Floating PackageVersion version\n\nIn `Directory.Packages.props`, add `<PackageVersion Include=\"Example.BuildTools\" Version=\"1.*\" />`. `Build.cs` as in previous example, but drop `@1.*`.\n\nError:\n\n```\ntools\\Build\\Build.csproj : error NU1011: Centrally defined floating package versions are not allowed.\nDone building project \"Build.csproj\" -- FAILED.\n```\n\nAs per https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu1011 we can avoid that with `<CentralPackageFloatingVersionsEnabled>true</CentralPackageFloatingVersionsEnabled>`, but (a) I don't want to enable that for _everything_ in Directory.Package.props, and (b) the documentation strongly discourages the use of this setting. (Well, technically, it discourages the use of floating versions... which is the thing I do want.)\n\n#### Hard-coded version\n\nIn `Directory.Packages.props`, add `<PackageVersion Include=\"Example.BuildTools\" Version=\"1.23.4\" />`. `Build.cs` as in previous example, but drop `@1.*`.\n\nWorks, but is a lot of churn in Directory.Packages.props when updates are shipped to our shared NuGet package. We want to use a floating version here.\n\n## Desired Solution\n\nIf `dotnet run Build.cs` is being executed in a folder that uses CPM, it would be nice if it auto-detected this scenario and output `VersionOverride` on the auto-generated `<PackageReference>`, instead of `Version`, avoiding NU1008.\n\n~~To some extent, it feels odd that the implicit csproj _does_ even inherit the Directory.Packages.props settings from a parent directory of the `*.cs` file being run. (I can see the arguments for and against, but it does raise some questions of how \"self-contained\" these single-file C# scripts should be. If I were to copy `Build.cs` from the \"Floating #:package Version\" example above to a different folder, say `C:\\Temp`, it would \"just work\".)~~\n\n**Edit:** I see that the behaviour of the implicit project file is [by design](https://github.com/jjonescz/dotnet-sdk/blob/core-prop/documentation/general/dotnet-run-file.md#multiple-c-files).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49192","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support PackageReference VersionOverride for `dotnet run`\" (#49192)"},{"Id":"3098824306","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-29T00:09:51","Actor":"ali50m","Number":"49190","RawContent":null,"Title":"how about make `dotnet run` on a default file?","State":"open","Body":"If there is no csproj, it will run on a default file something like `app.cs` or `main.cs`?

The time feels right now for .NET 10 to move these settings into the default targets and remove from project templates.

In our single-file run capabilities in .NET 10 for example, you move from a single simple .cs file and with `dotnet project convert` you get the expected csproj file, but now new properties that you have no idea where they were before, why you now have to know about them when you didn't before, etc.  \n\nThese should now be the default path forward for modern C# development.\n\n## Impact Concerns\n\nThis likely will cause `WarningsAsErrors` impact as without TFM-targeted changes this would be an upgrade breaking change, but only in new scenarios.

Someone who simply removed the property rather than set it do `disabled` for an example would now be more impacted.\n\nIdeally if a `if (TFM>=net10.0)` could be applied in the targets this would help mitigate, but not help with cleaning the template experiences removing boilerplate.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49182","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Move `ImplicitUsings` and `Nullable` into the core targets\" (#49182)"},{"Id":"3097552733","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-28T14:15:30","Actor":"adamsitnik","Number":"49181","RawContent":null,"Title":"stop using System.CommandLine types that aren't public anymore","State":"open","Body":"First of all, I've tried to eliminate the need of using the Help APIs that were made internal.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

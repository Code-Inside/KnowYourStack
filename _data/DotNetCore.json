All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system)\r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project)\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu)\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness)\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker)\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools)\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf)\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**.

issue \"bug: x64 and x86 dotnet don't see each other\" (#16234) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"I am trying to set-up a CI for building/publishing and then hosting a Blazor app on the same Windows machine. So to build/publish it I need a .NET SDK, and to host it on IIS I also need .NET Hosting Bundle (to have _AspNetCoreModuleV2_ in the IIS). I want the CI to be able to install missing .NET bundles, so before the deployment I need to check which ones are installed. I am using a `dotnet --list-sdks` and `dotnet --list-runtimes` commands. It turns out, if I first install .NET SDK and then .NET Hosting Bundle, then the output of `dotnet --list-sdks` disappears, and vice versa in reverse order. Experimentally, I have found out that this happens, because .NET Hosting bundle is installed in the Program Files (x86) directory, opposed to .NET SDK, so there are two **dotnet.exe** files, one in Program Files and another one is in Program Files (x86). If I run the x86 version of dotnet.exe, it is unable to see installed x64 components, and if I use the one from Program Files folder, it doesn't see the x86 components. It seems like a bug to me.\r\n\r\nReproduction Steps (powershell)\r\n\r\n1. Install .NET SDK (https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/5.0.200/dotnet-sdk-5.0.200-win-x64.exe)\r\n2. Restart Powershell Window (so new PATH variables are picked up)\r\n3. Run `dotnet --list-sdks`. Output: `5.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]`.\r\n4. Run `(Get-Command dotnet).Path`. Output: `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\dotnet.exe`.\r\n4. Install .NET Hosting Bundle (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-5.0.3-windows-hosting-bundle-installer)\r\n5. Restart Powershell Window (so new PATH variables are picked up)\r\n6. run `dotnet --list-sdks`. Output: <empty>\r\n7. Run `(Get-Command dotnet).Path`. Output: `C:\\Program Files

MSVC epilogues on x86","State":"open","Body":"# Description\r\n\r\nMSVC introduced changes into their prologue/epilogue helpers. Particularly `_EH_prolog3_catch_GS_align`/`_EH_epilog3_GS_align` had a `mov esp, ebx` instruction the lazy unwinding didn't handle. This helper ended up getting called by 3 FCalls in all coreclr: \r\n\r\n- `DebugDebugger::Log`\r\n- `StubHelpers::ValidateObjec`\r\n- `COMDelegate::BindToMethodName`\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers will see seeing seemingly random behavior once one of these stubs is hit. This manifests as GC holes where the stack walking caused the GC to not find stack roots, effectively unrooting object with references in the stack. A customer reported this from their use of `Debug.WriteLine` .\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with respect to previous releases. The regression was caused by a native toolset update in the build agents.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nA repro app that used to crash in under a second using GC stress ran successfully for 12+hrs with no issues. \r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nVery targeted fix, both @jkotas and I have stepped through the unwinder logic and it's as minimally invasive as possible while preserving correctness.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

This is called the primary constructor for the type. It is an error to have a primary\r\n> constructor and a constructor with the same signature already present in the struct.\r\n> A record struct is not permitted to declare a parameterless primary constructor.\r\n> \r\n> Instance field declarations for a record struct are permitted to include variable initializers.\r\n> If there is no primary constructor, the instance initializers execute as part of the parameterless constructor.\r\n> Otherwise, at runtime the primary constructor executes the instance initializers appearing in the record-struct-body.\r\n> \r\n> If a record struct has a primary constructor, any user-defined constructor, except \"copy constructor\" must have an\r\n> explicit `this` constructor initializer.\r\n> \r\n> Parameters of the primary constructor as well as members of the record struct are in scope within initializers of instance fields or properties. \r\n> Instance members would be an error in these locations (similar to how instance members are in scope in regular constructor initializers\r\n> today, but an error to use), but the parameters of the primary constructor would be in scope and useable and\r\nwould shadow members. Static members would also be useable.\r\n> \r\n> A warning is produced if a parameter of the primary constructor is not read.\r\n> \r\n> The definite assigment rules for struct instance constructors apply to the primary constructor of record structs. For instance, the following\r\n> is an error:\r\n> \r\n> ```csharp\r\n> record struct Pos(int X) // definite assignment error in primary constructor\r\n> {\r\n>     private int x;\r\n>     public int X { get { return x; } set { x = value; } } = X;\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ### Properties\r\n> \r\n> For each record struct parameter of a record struct declaration there is a corresponding public property\r\nmember whose name and type are taken from the value parameter declaration.\r\n> \r\n> For a record struct:\r\n> \r\n> * A public `get` and `init` auto-property is created if the record struct has `readonly` modifier, `get` and `set` otherwise.\r\n>   Both kinds of set accessors (`set` and `init`) are considered \"matching\". So the user may declare an init-only property\r\n>   in place of a synthesized mutable one.\r\n>   An inherited `abstract` property with matching type is overridden.\r\n>   It is an error if the inherited property does not have `public` `get` and `set`/`init` accessors.\r\n>   The auto-property is initialized to the value of the corresponding primary constructor parameter.\r\n>   Attributes can be applied to the synthesized auto-property and its backing field by using `property:` or `field:`\r\n>   targets for attributes syntactically applied to the corresponding record struct parameter.  \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/51720","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Record structs: add properties and primary ctor\" (#51720)"},{"Id":"823784085","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-07T00:04:04","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"51719","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge main to features/interpolated-string","State":"open","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from main into features/interpolated-string.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/features/interpolated-string\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

Generally the author whose change introduced the conflicts should pull down this PR, fix the conflicts locally, then push up a commit resolving the conflicts.\n\n### Resolve merge conflicts using your local repo\nSometimes merge conflicts may be present on GitHub but merging locally will work without conflicts.

We don't need text sync for C# right now (it is only for cntrl+Q search which can use the workspace text).\r\n2.  There are very likely other underlying text sync issues, so if we don't throw and restart we may end up with invalid documents or encounter other issues which would lead to wrong cntrl+Q search results (e.g. we get an open and then drop all change requests).  It is best to just use the workspace text which we know to be correct.\r\n3.  There's not much more we can learn from 16.9 by leaving it on.  There is more LSP client logging in 16.10 (and on our side), we've improved our text sync handling, and the LSP client refactor will fix a ton of race conditions.  Additionally, there are bugs in 16.9 with attaching loghub logs to feedback, so we don't even always get logs.  We'd be doing more harm than good by leaving it on.\r\n4. Wholesale disabling text sync is a small change that is easy to verify.\r\n\r\nWe leave it enabled for razor for a couple reasons.\r\n1.  LSP for razor is non-sensical without text sync.  Diagnostics will be mismatched, completion will be wrong, etc.\r\n2.  LSP for razor is experimental and under a feature flag and not rolled out completely\r\n3.  Text buffers for razor are in-memory and not actual files and are protected by client name.  We think it is less likely that changes to these buffers (e.g. during git checkout / project reload) will randomly become text files.  We don't have feedback issues around txt files causing the razor c# server to restart (though there are other known text sync issues, e.g. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30002)\r\n\r\n\r\nf846b17 should be reverted in 16.10 as we've somewhat mitigated the restarting issue and there are additional LSP client logs to help diagnose issues.

see each other","State":"open","Body":"I am trying to set-up a CI for building/publishing and then hosting a Blazor app on the same Windows machine. So to build/publish it I need a .NET SDK, and to host it on IIS I also need .NET Hosting Bundle (to have _AspNetCoreModuleV2_ in the IIS). I want the CI to be able to install missing .NET bundles, so before the deployment I need to check if there are any already installed. I am using a `dotnet --list-sdks` and `dotnet --list-runtimes` commands. It turns out, if I first install .NET SDK and then .NET Hosting Bundle, then the output of `dotnet --list-sdks` disappears, and vice versa in reverse order. Experimentally, I have found out that this happens, because .NET Hosting bundle is installed in the Program Files (x86) directory, opposed to .NET SDK, so there are two **dotnet.exe** files, one in Program Files and another one is in Program Files (x86). If I run the x86 version of dotnet.exe, it is unable to see installed x64 components, and if I use the one from Program Files folder, it doesn't see the x86 components. It seems like a bug to me.\r\n\r\nReproduction Steps (powershell)\r\n\r\n1. Install .NET SDK (https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/5.0.200/dotnet-sdk-5.0.200-win-x64.exe)\r\n2.

While installation can be done via a public nuget package, one can also use the `--add-source` property to install directly from a `.nupkg` file (as the above tutorial demos). The problem is I had exceptions that in the end I discovered were due to having an extra private nuget packageSource registered on my system, which caused the installation to fail. Simply removing the extra source temporarily fixed the problem, but then adding it back, any subsequent attempts to install a global tool require the same workaround.\r\n\r\nExample: If I have a .nupkg named `microsoft.botsay` (to use the above tutorial example, thus full file name being: `microsoft.botsay.1.0.0.nupkg`) located within `C:\\Tools\\Botsay`, the following should work:\r\n\r\n`dotnet tool install -g --add-source C:\\Tools\\Botsay microsoft.botsay`\r\n\r\nBut I get this exception:\r\n\r\n> C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.103\\NuGet.targets(131,5): error : **Unable to load the service index for source `https://www.myget.org/F/<some-company>/api/v3/index.json`.** [C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\aqoqbaoa.yc5\\restore.csproj]\r\n> C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.103\\NuGet.targets(131,5): error :   **Response status code does not indicate success: 401 (Unauthorized).**\r\n> The tool package could not be restored.\r\n> Tool 'microsoft.botsay' failed to install. This failure may have been caused by:\r\n> \r\n> * You are attempting to install a preview release and did not use the --version option to specify the version.\r\n> * A package by this name was found, but it was not a .NET tool.\r\n> * The required NuGet feed cannot be accessed, perhaps because of an Internet connection problem.\r\n> * You mistyped the name of the tool.\r\n> \r\n> For more reasons, including package naming enforcement, visit https://aka.ms/failure-installing-tool\r\n\r\nAs you can see there is a 401 Unauthorized exception when trying to read that myget feed, which clearly the only reason the system knows about it is because it's registered on one's system as a nuget package sourced. \r\n\r\nOne can navigate to their package manager settings via `%appdata%/nuget` where a `NuGet.Config` file exists, which is also what gets set by one's Visual Studio->Options->NuGet Package Manager->Package Sources form. In my case I had in addition to the normal nuget package source, a private myget source, listed last, by the same url as listed in the exception. One needs credentials to view that url in a browser etc. SIMPLY COMMENTING OUT that `packageSource` allows the above install command to succeed. One moment later and you can re-add the myget source, BUT: This would be a really bad experience if you need to have a team, etc, follow this workaround just to install this, as many other devs might easily have a private packageSource feed in their system as well.\r\n\r\n_My guess_ is that this tool reads all nuget sources listed as `<packageSources>` (reading the public nuget one first obviously) to see if there are any conflicts with the tool being installed. But then when it hits a private feed, which it is not authorized to open, the process fails and there is an exception, which terminates the install, even though otherwise that myget package source works fine in VStudio and on my system. It **should** just ignore that private (in this case myget) index.json file when it can't be read. That would fix this problem.\r\n\r\nCheers","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16215","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`dotnet tool install -g --add-source` exception when private nuget packageSource (myget) exists\" (#16215)"},{"Id":"822503212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-04T22:34:39","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"16214","RawContent":null,"Title":"When discovering tag helpers, use the codegened assembly","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16214","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"When discovering tag helpers, use the codegened assembly\" (#16214)"},{"Id":"822452441","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-04T21:57:41","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"16212","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/6.0.1xx-preview2] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c1e1517c-dd66-41b3-53c4-08d8d783ffb7)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: c1e1517c-dd66-41b3-53c4-08d8d783ffb7\r\n- **Build**: 20210304.6\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/4/2021 7:11 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 3eaf1f316b8b1da73fdb98e9cca43c0ddaa12f45\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/6.0-preview2\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\r\n\r\nExploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Core. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core checks the source markup of a file.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application running on .NET Core 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.0, you should download and install Runtime 3.0.2 or SDK 3.0.102 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.1 or SDK 3.1.101 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 3.0 and 3.1 installed, you need to install the updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including terms and conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core GitHub organization. The main repos are located at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime and https://github.com/dotnet/aspnet/. The Announcements repo (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1368267637017436160","CreatedAt":"2021-03-06T18:30:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Interested in learning how to build Web APIs with @aspnet?

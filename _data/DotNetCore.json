This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK or .NET Core Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET. As Canonical does not build/publish .2xx and higher SDK feature bands due to breaking changes, new Snap will only support .1xx SDK feature band for the lifetime of a major .NET version.\r\n- .NET previews (.NET 9 previews) will not be available to install via Snap.\r\n\r\n   _Stay tuned for date and call to action to switch from old to new .NET Snaps._\r\n\r\n### Issue Log\r\nAfter ownership is transferred from Microsoft to Canonical in May, log any .NET Snap issues to the dotnet-snap repository under the Canonical org [https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcanonical%2Fdotnet-snap&data=05%7C02%7Cashitanagar%40microsoft.com%7Cc5b9b895923f4c11483908dc57efcb4c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638481934634983274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fvusMJ%2Fl94m3WaJvpM7kK85%2BzIXGLsenPt7BmKPtRSU%3D&reserved=0).\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n[.NET SDK Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-sdk)\r\n[Canonical GitHub Repository](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap)\r\n"},{"Id":"37311676843","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T18:22:02","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/303","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\" (#303) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 8.0.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key.

On hte host, we have dumped the text contents to a memory mapped file already.  If so, then just send the segments of the memory mapped file over to OOP to use for rehydrating.\r\n2. If we have not dumped the contents to the memory mapped file yet, we send over the contents over the wire.\r\n\r\nIn practice, 99.999% of syncs go through the '1' path.  This is because we've already read in the contents on the host (which we do as part of solution checksum'ing), and at that point we dump to the memory mapped file.\r\n\r\nThen, on the receiving side (the OOP side), we would get those memory mapped segments, and would rehydrate the SourceText there in memory, and update the solution.  But rehydrating the SourceText is overkill.  We only need the texts for files we're actually parsing because we need the trees/compilations for those particular files/projects.  Practically, this is only needed for the documents the user is interacting with (and the projects they depend on).  In real world scenarios, this is commonly a much smaller amount than the total number of actual files.  For example, with something like a file opened in MS.CA.Remote (which depends on compiler layers, workspace layers, and feature layers), this was only a 5th of the total files in roslyn, not the entirety of it.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR changes things so that we don't optimistically rehydrate the docs.  Instead, we lazily do it when needed.  Our internal text-loading infrastructure is already designed around this lazyness concept (that's what a 'TextLoader' is vs a 'SourceText'), so this slotted in very cleanly.

The Roslyn compiler currently normalizes this to be `0` across all platforms and architectures for determinism purposes (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37772).\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nThis is as per the language spec (https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/conversions.md):\r\n> * For a conversion from float or double to an integral type, the processing depends on the overflow-checking context ([§12.8.19](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/expressions.md#12819-the-checked-and-unchecked-operators)) in which the conversion takes place:\r\n>  * In a checked context, the conversion proceeds as follows:\r\n>    * If the value of the operand is NaN or infinite, a System.OverflowException is thrown.\r\n>    * Otherwise, the source operand is rounded towards zero to the nearest integral value. If this integral value is within the range of the destination type then this value is the result of the conversion.\r\n>    * Otherwise, a System.OverflowException is thrown.\r\n>  * In an unchecked context, the conversion always succeeds, and proceeds as follows.\r\n>    * If the value of the operand is NaN or infinite, the result of the conversion is an unspecified value of the destination type.\r\n>    * Otherwise, the source operand is rounded towards zero to the nearest integral value. If this integral value is within the range of the destination type then this value is the result of the conversion.\r\n>    * Otherwise, the result of the conversion is an unspecified value of the destination type.\r\n\r\nThe runtime spec ([ECMA-335](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-335/)) -- III.3.27 conv.<to type>:\r\n> If overflow occurs converting a floating-point type to an integer, or if the floating-point value being converted to an integer is a NaN, the value returned is unspecified.\r\n\r\nand the [IEEE 754](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/754/6210/) (otherwise known as ISO/IEC 60559) specification (noting that for the IEEE 754 specification, there is allowed disabling of floating-point exceptions, which is how the runtime operates):\r\n> When a NaN or infinite operand cannot be represented in the destination format and this cannot otherwise be indicated, the invalid operation exception shall be signaled. When a numeric operand would convert to an integer outside the range of the destination format, the invalid operation exception shall be signaled if this situation cannot otherwise be indicated.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nWhile the behavior is left up to the implementation by all these specifications, this has lead to problems for users that are targeting different platforms (x64 vs Arm64) and is incompatible with some targets that require a more stringent behavior (WASM).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the runtime has made steps towards normalizing the behavior itself (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/61885) and the behavior we landed on is not the same one Roslyn opted for. In particular, we do want `NaN -> 0`, but for `overflow` we want it to instead `saturate` (that is if the source is greater than the maximum value of the target type, it saturates to the maximum value of the target type; if it is less than the minimum, it saturates to the minimum. Thus `float.MaxValue -> int.MaxValue`, `float.MinValue -> int.MinValue`).\r\n\r\nThis decision was made based on the choices made by several other languages (such as Rust and Java), the behavior of more modern platforms (such as Arm64), and the required behavior for key platforms coming online (such as WASM).\r\n\r\n### Recommended Change\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it would be beneficial if the Roslyn compiler could move towards the same behavior so that on .NET 9+ users will see the same results across all target CPU architectures regardless of whether the operation is constant folded by Roslyn, constant folded by the JIT/AOT, or evaluated at runtime.\r\n\r\nThis would simply entail that `NaN -> 0` and overflow is done via saturation, as described above.

semantic model (after it is acquired) for the active document (if one exists).","State":"closed","Body":"We're seeing a lot of cases where both the local solution and OOP solution end up recreating the semantic model for the active document repeatedly.  This is because we intentionally do not hold onto semantic models strongly, so tehy can drop away after use.  this is valuable so that features that access lots of docs don't end up rooting a huge amount of memory.  However, it has the downside that heavily used, and very important docs (like the *user's actively edited* document) aren't held onto, leading to features getting the semantic model, and then having it drop away prior to the next feature waking up and obtaining it.  As features run on very different cadences, and GCs are happening very regularly, these models often drop away.\r\n\r\nIn prior versions of roslyn, we had complex caches with complex rules for populating and purging.  These caches were not well understood, and often caused major problems for us (like rooting 10s of GB of memory, and only releasing them on some long time-based cadence).  We ended up removing them, getting to a much better point where our memory usage would now peak far lower, and would stay relatively stable.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds back in a cache, but in a *very* targeted fashion.  It only caches one semantic model around, only if the requested model is for the active document.  This concept works in both the local host and in the OOP server, allowing both to keep that sole model around once asked until either edits come in, or hte active doc changes.  The logic here is then quite simple, and the amount of memory used will be bounded to the whatever that single model needs.  \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nGoing to run speedometer tests to ensure this causes no issue (and we're hoping to see benefits here as well).\r\n\r\nPR1: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=9434937&view=results\r\nPR2: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=9434940&view=results","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73074","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Have the workspace cache the semantic model (after it is acquired) for the active document (if one exists).\" (#73074)"},{"Id":"2249035924","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T14:49:41","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"73071","RawContent":null,"Title":"Pass along cancellation token in snippets","State":"closed","Body":"Thread through a cancellation token from a callee parameter instead of silently ignoring it.\r\n\r\nNote that this will not have any product impact on cancellation in snippets, since a caller further up the chain still hard-codes `CancellationToken.None`.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/1401f9bf94295c3a0d06c9beea90b2e26be827a8/src/VisualStudio/Core/Def/Snippets/SnippetFunctions/AbstractSnippetFunction.IVsExpansionFunction.cs#L15-L19","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73071","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Pass along cancellation token in snippets\" (#73071)"},{"Id":"2250649476","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T13:04:30","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"73082","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue with Strong Name Signing stopping IntelliSense from working","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Issue-with-Strong-Name-Signing-stopping-/10641328)._\n\n---\n[severity:It's more difficult to complete my work]\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Professional 2022 Version 17.9.6\n\nI have an issue with a solution where IntelliSense and error squiggles  stopped working as expected. The solution is .NET Framework v4.8 with a vb.net project as UI and a C# Class Library with SDK project file targeting net48. The other library project is also strong name signed but does not have an issue. The C# library will (usually after a reboot) stop working with no errors shown. The library stops being recognised in the UI project text editor, but will still compile without any error. When this happens, IntelliSense stops working in the U I project.\n\nI have attached a video showing the problem. In the video, on line 251, I have added a method called IsValidParameter(). This method does not exist although there are no errors shown or error squiggles under the method name. I also can’t press Ctrl+. And create the method as it does not show up as an option. It took me a long time to try and figure out what was happening.\n\nTo resolve the issue, I have to go into the C# class library properties and go to the Strong Name section. I remove the strong name file and then add it back in. This then resolves the issue (as you can see in the video).\nI have tried recreating the C# class library from scratch, but still the same problem occurs. \n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 4/18/2024, 03:37 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73082","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Issue with Strong Name Signing stopping IntelliSense from working\" (#73082)"},{"Id":"2250435464","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T11:21:19","Actor":"jjonescz","Number":"73081","RawContent":null,"Title":"Visit binary operators in ref safety analysis","State":"open","Body":"Alternative to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72935.\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72873.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73081","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Visit binary operators in ref safety analysis\" (#73081)"},{"Id":"2249581180","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T07:52:28","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"73078","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use 'nullable disabled' semantic model when computing FAR results","State":"closed","Body":"Traces show upwards of 15% of our time in nullability analysis for these features:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/4564579/c2347d9a-d5ae-4520-b70c-d3ea2965e88c)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73078","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use 'nullable disabled' semantic model when computing FAR results\" (#73078)"},{"Id":"2249621632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T06:06:21","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"73079","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use 'nullable disabled' semantic model when computing doc highlights results","State":"closed","Body":"Will also ebnefit from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73078 as doc-highlights uses FAR.\r\n\r\ntraces show upwards of 15% of our time just in nullability analysis for these features:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/4564579/80684c15-2181-478b-8bdb-0f56766e9e81)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73079","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use 'nullable disabled' semantic model when computing doc highlights results\" (#73079)"},{"Id":"2249489501","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T00:19:46","Actor":"ryzngard","Number":"73077","RawContent":null,"Title":"Watch razor and cshtml files for devkit","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73077","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Watch razor and cshtml files for devkit\" (#73077)"},{"Id":"2249481789","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T00:11:00","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"73076","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-34817.155","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/84c5476ef3111c9abd78d43e65063280bb7202d9...ea35f7ce524e9424adb16fd6b8a2308e55e6de0e?w=1)\n- [Add Hot Reload brokered service registration (72989)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72989)\n- [[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/command-line-api (72840)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72840)\n- [Merge pull request 73026 from CyrusNajmabadi/searchGeneratedDocs](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73026)\n- [Merge pull request 73012 from DoctorKrolic/make-anonymous-function-static](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73012)\n- [Add support for checksum-based interceptors (72814)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72814)\n- [[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/source-build-externals (72993)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72993)\n- [Workaround for ILanguageService exports with no Layer (72986)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72986)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73076","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-34817.155\" (#73076)"},{"Id":"2249388676","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-17T22:44:19","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"73075","RawContent":null,"Title":"Compiler task is passing `/generatedfilesout` even though it didn't create the directory","State":"open","Body":"`Could not find a part of the path` makes it sound like the output directory is not present.

The first item here will potentially change between runs!!!\r\n        Descriptor = SupportedDiagnostics[0];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't 100% confirmed this is the problem but it seems very likely. If it's not the problem it still seems like a bug. \r\n\r\nNote: the actual repro for this is internal so please reach out to me and I will connect you with the data. \r\n\r\n[titles]:

Run \"dotnet workload restore\" to install this workload version.`\r\n\r\nIt should instead say something more like `Workload installation failed: Workload version 8.0.300-preview.1.24164.2, which was specified in C:\\GitHub\\sdk\\global.json was not found. Adding a feed that contains it to your NuGet.config may help.`\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nWe ❤ code!

The process in simple terms consists of a check that happens daily against your configured feeds to see if there are any newer versions of the workloads than the ones you have. Later, if you run a `dotnet` command like `dotnet build`, the SDK prints out a message letting you know that there are updates in your installed workloads, so that you can update them.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this functionality is broken when a workload is installed by Visual Studio, as opposed to being manually installed via the command line. This is bad for a group of users like Windows .NET Aspire users, as they mostly rely on getting their workloads installed via  Visual Studio. The reason why this is bad is because if Aspire ever decides to ship a newer version of the workload before it is available  in a Visual Studio update, then users will have no way of knowing that a newer version is available. In Aspire, we are considering shipping our workloads in a different schedule (that may not necessarily match Visual Studio schedule), but this issue is currently being a blocker for that. It would be great if this issue can be fixed, so we can start having an alternative for notifying customers when newer versions are available.\r\n\r\ncc: @marcpopMSFT @dsplaisted @joeloff @DamianEdwards ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/40295","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Notification of newer workload versions available isn't displayed with versions installed through Visual Studio \" (#40295)"},{"Id":"2251645207","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-18T21:57:11","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"40294","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/7.0.4xx' => 'release/8.0.1xx'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the release/7.0.4xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/8.0.1xx.

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET.

It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BinaryFormatter is being removed in .NET 9\" (#293)"},{"Id":"2072888869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:52","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"292","RawContent":null,"Title":" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96700\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.

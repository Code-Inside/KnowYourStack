No type arguments should be provided if the method is non-generic.\r\n\r\nFurther testing showed that if I called the 'OrderBy' methods explicitly, rather than dynamically, before I performed the dynamic '**Expression.Call**' it would work with the **.Net Native tool chain** setting.  So I distilled the method down to this (this is not a fix, this just illustrates the problem):\r\n\r\n```\r\n        public static List<T> OrderByField<T>(this ObservableCollection<T> observableCollection, string sortField, string sortDirection)\r\n        {\r\n            // [HACK] This fixes it so that the call to Expression.Call doesn't crash.\r\n            IQueryable<T> queryable1 = new ObservableCollection<T>().AsQueryable();\r\n            Queryable.OrderBy<T, int>(queryable1, p => p.GetHashCode());\r\n            Queryable.OrderByDescending<T, int>(queryable1, p => p.GetHashCode());\r\n\r\n            // Sort the collection based on the name of the parameter.\r\n            IQueryable<T> queryable = observableCollection.AsQueryable();\r\n            string method = sortDirection == \"Asc\" ? \"OrderBy\" : \"OrderByDescending\";\r\n            var parameter = Expression.Parameter(queryable.ElementType, \"p\");\r\n            var property = Expression.Property(parameter, sortField);\r\n            var expression = Expression.Lambda(property, parameter);\r\n            Type[] types = new Type[] { queryable.ElementType, expression.Body.Type };\r\n            var methodCallExpression = Expression.Call(typeof(Queryable), method, types, queryable.Expression, expression);\r\n            return queryable.Provider.CreateQuery<T>(methodCallExpression).ToList();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\nThere is some strange bug in the dynamic **Expression.Call** that only expresses itself when compiled with the **.NET Native tool chain**.  Initializing the library by calling the functions explicitly seems to 'prime' the pump and allow the method to work as intended."},{"Id":"23966360287","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-09-13T01:39:01","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/standard","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1771","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Referencing netstandard 2.0 from WebSITE targeting .Net 4.8\" (#1771) at dotnet/standard","RelatedBody":"I am having an issue referencing packages that target .NetStandard 2.0 from my webSITE (not application) project which targets .Net 4.8.\r\n\r\nI see the following error:\r\n\r\n\r\n> warning MSB3268: The primary reference \"D:\\a\\1\\s\\iSAMS.Web.Controls\\bin\\Release\\net48\\iSAMS.Web.Controls.dll\" could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the framework assembly \"netstandard, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51\" which could not be resolved in the currently targeted framework. \".NETFramework,Version=v4.8\".

The runtime identifier of the SDK is always used.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new app\r\n2. Update the .csproj to specify a `RuntimeIdentifier` that is not the same as the SDK you are using. For example, when using a Windows x64 SDK, specify:\r\n  `<RuntimeIdentifier>win-x86</RuntimeIdentifier>`\r\n3. Build or publish as self-contained:\r\n  `dotnet build --self-contained`\r\n  `dotnet publish --self-contained`\r\n\r\n**Expected:** The application is built/published using the RID specified in the project - `win-x86`.\r\n\r\n**Actual:** The application is built/published using the RID of the SDK - `win-x64` - not the one explicitly set in the project.\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n\r\nFor the repro steps above, MSBuild ends up invoked with:\r\n`-property:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64 -property:_CommandLineDefinedRuntimeIdentifier=true`\r\n\r\nThe SDK is explicitly adding the `RuntimeIdentifier` property on the command line if self-contained is specified on the command line, but the runtime identifier is not.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe [dotnet/announcements](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements) repo is intended to keep everyone informed about important information related to the .NET platform. It is a one-way broadcast that plays nicely with GitHub notifications, making it desirable to watch/subscribe to it.\r\n\r\nWe've come up with some best practice guidelines on how to use these announcements. Our approach to announcements enables some things to work well and requires a little extra care with others.\r\n\r\n## Design points\r\n\r\nAs a broad description, think of dotnet/announcements as an aggregated mirror of important issues and GitHub notifications as an RSS feed for it. The issues in this repo are NOT the canonical copy, but a mirror.\r\n\r\nThe key design points of dotnet/announcements:\r\n\r\n- Issues-only repo.\r\n- Only a few people can create issues.\r\n- Issues are mirrored copies of issues from other repos.\r\n- Issues are locked immediately.\r\n\r\nThese design points significantly reduce the scale of notifications from this repo, resulting in high signal to noise. It also avoid two sets of uncoordinated discussions. Discussions only occur on the canonical issue.\r\n\r\nNote: We (ab)use \"temporary interaction limits\" so that only a few people can post to the repo. It would be ideal if this model (one-way broadcast) was better supported and we could just pin arbitrary org issues to an read-only announcements repo. \r\n\r\n## Best practices\r\n\r\nThe following best practices are intended to result in best overall community experience.\r\n\r\n### Don't link to dotnet/announcements from GitHub\r\n\r\nGitHub includes [references to other issues or PRs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7038#ref-issue-1224354673) that link to an issue or PR as part of the comment/activity history. It's an excellent feature that helps us understand who else cares about a given topic. We actively rely on it and sometimes [reach out to other projects to help them](https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/3276#issuecomment-1118911927).\r\n\r\nThis feature doesn't work with locked issues (which makes sense). Please do not link -- from GitHub -- to the locked mirror issue on dotnet/announcements, but to the unlocked canonical issue. Your reference will be blocked by the lock. That's counter-productive.\r\n\r\nYou can see this dynamic playing out in the following matching/pair issues. The canonical issue has all the messy (and useful) activity and the locked dotnet/announcement issue is a clean replica.\r\n\r\n- [Canonical issue](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428)\r\n- [dotnet/announcements mirror issue](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218)\r\n\r\nYou'll see the same pattern with other [dotnet/announcement issues](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues).\r\n\r\n### Prefer linking to dotnet/announcements from the web\r\n\r\nThere is value in linking to dotnet/announcements from blogs and other sites (like StackOverflow, just not GitHub). The value is that more people might discover dotnet/announcements, subscribe to it, and be better informed about .NET platform news.\r\n\r\nFrom dotnet/announcements, users can quickly jump to a canonical issue should they want to. However, if you want to link directly to canonical issues, that's A-OK.\r\n\r\n### Create your own queries\r\n\r\nIt is easy to create your own queries of dotnet/announcement issues. The easiest way to do that is via [labels](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels).\r\n\r\nHere are some good ones:\r\n\r\n- [Docker](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Docker)\r\n- [Monthly-Update](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Monthly-Update)\r\n- [Breaking%20Change](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Breaking%20Change)\r\n\r\nLooks like we messed up when we created the breaking change label. Team, let's try to avoid labels with spaces in future. We could change it, but ...\r\n\r\nYou can also create slightly more complex queries:\r\n\r\n- [.NET 6.0 + Security](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASecurity+label%3A%22.NET+6.0%22)\r\n- [.NET 6.0 + Monthly Update](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMonthly-Update+label%3A%22.NET+6.0%22+)\r\n\r\nNote: This best practice creates query links to dotnet/announcements, which can be seen as violating the previous practice. The query links unavoidably target dotnet/announcements.\r\n\r\n### Subscribe to notifications\r\n\r\nSubscribe to notifications will help keep you up to date with .NET Platform news. To subscribe, click the \"Watch\" button.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"614\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/175190716-572b42db-494e-44c9-9a74-add258c234fa.png\">\r\n\r\nYou will want to select \"All Activity\".\r\n\r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/175190922-19c15684-17e1-462c-9fc9-48cfd14cdfef.png\">\r\n\r\n## Bests practices for Microsoft folks\r\n\r\nMicrosoft folks should follow these practices when posting issues to dotnet/announcements\r\n\r\n### Direct reader to the canonical issue\r\n\r\nDirect readers to the canonical issue as an immediate call out, with following pattern:\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7556. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/223\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/227\r\n\r\nThe canonical issue should not link to the dotnet/announcements mirror issue.\r\n\r\n### Consider creating the canonical issue as a discussion\r\n\r\nThe GitHub discussion feature is very good. For issues that are sure to spark feedback and/or benefit from more discussion, you should use a discussion issue.\r\n\r\nGood discussion example: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/discussions/71042\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/229","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet/announcements best practices\" (#229)"},{"Id":"1287906136","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T21:30:32","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"228","RawContent":null,"Title":"`System.Drawing.Common` will only be supported on Windows","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n***Note:** This is a re-post of a design point we already discussed and shipped in .NET 6. I'm posting this here because (1) some people have tried to find it here and (2) some folks have never heard of it.*\r\n\r\nMoving forward, `System.Drawing.Windows` will only be supported on Windows. The library is marked as Windows-only (which results in build warnings when used from cross-platform code) and will throw by default when used from a non-Windows OS. For the time being, there is a runtime switch that enables users to still carry and use their own copy of `libgdiplus`. We intend to remove this functionality eventually as well.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nIn the .NET Core 2.x days we created the `Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility` package which exposes many Windows-only APIs so that more people can migrate to .NET Core. As part of this, we also ported `System.Drawing.Common`. This was mainly meant for .NET Core users that still target Windows, however since Mono already had a cross-platform implementation, we decided to bring that over. The cross-platform functionality is provided via the native library `libgdiplus`. Sadly, `libgdiplus` is a community supported library and at this point effectively unmaintained.\r\n\r\nWhile `libgdiplus` has helped a lot of customers expand to cross-platform it has also caused some headaches. `System.Drawing.Common` is very Windows driven as it is mostly a wrapper around GDI+ and is heavily coupled to Windows Forms, which keeps evolving and diverging from cross-platform graphics. This has caused some confusion over why some things don't work well on Unix or don't work at all.\r\n\r\nThe cross-platform implementation of `System.Drawing.Common` is mainly provided on the native side, via `libgdiplus`. It's effectively a re-implementation of the parts of Windows that `System.Drawing.Common` is depending on. As you can imagine, that makes `libgdiplus` a very non-trivial component. It's around 30k lines of pretty old C code, virtually untested, and lacks a lot of functionality. `libgdiplus` also has a lot of external dependencies for all the image processing and text rendering, such as `cairo`, `pango`, and other native libraries, which makes maintaining and shipping it even more challenging.\r\n\r\nSince `System.Drawing.Common` was really designed to be a thin wrapper over Windows technologies, its cross-platform implementation is a bit like a square peg in a round hole; it's subpar because it was only designed with Windows in mind.\r\n\r\nSince the inclusion of the Mono cross-platform implementation we spent lot of time redirecting issues to `libgdiplus` that never got fixed, or helping people install `libgdiplus` correctly (because it's not part of .NET Core proper). This is very different from other external dependencies we have taken, for example, `icu` or `openssl`, which are high-quality libraries, rather than poorly maintained re-implementation of Windows components. Thus, we have come to believe that it's not viable to get `libgdiplus` to the point where its feature set and quality is on par with the rest of the .NET stack.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed (such as from analysis of NuGet packages) that `System.Drawing.Common` is used on cross-platform mostly for image manipulation like QR code generators and text rendering. We haven't noticed heavy graphics usage as our cross-platform graphics support is very incomplete. For example, right now some components crash on macOS because the native APIs we use have been deprecated and are no longer included with recent macOS releases. We have never gotten a report about that crash; we discovered it ourselves while making `System.Drawing.Common` trim compatible.\r\n\r\nThe usages we see of `System.Drawing.Common` in non-Windows environments are typically well supported with `SkiaSharp` and `ImageSharp`.\r\n\r\nThus, we believe it is not worth investing in making `System.Drawing.Common` work on non-Windows platforms and instead propose we only keep evolving it in the context of Windows Forms and GDI+.\r\n\r\n## Design Approach\r\n\r\nFor more details on the design approach, see [this design document](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234/files?short_path=5a79205#diff-5a79205cd271d8ec2d3c5d74112f6874998e1e1aa7ee00900db727eef25561d8).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/228","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`System.Drawing.Common` will only be supported on Windows\" (#228)"},{"Id":"1284382326","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T00:31:43","Actor":"richlander","Number":"227","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 ","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/71231. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 \r\n \r\nThe [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist) package has historically allowed us to fast-track EventSource API bug fixes out-of-band for .NET Framework 4.x. In recent years we continued to ship versions of this package concurrently with .NET Core releases, but the last time it was used to intentionally distribute out-of-band fixes for .NET Framework was package version 1.1.28 from 2015. The fixes that originally made the package useful have long since been applied to the .NET Framework in-box EventSource API and now we plan to phase out this package. Support for the current 6.0 version of the package will continue for as long as .NET 6.0 is supported but no future versions concurrent with .NET 7 and beyond are planned.\r\n \r\nWe recommend developers targeting .NET Framework 4.x use the in-box version of the EventSource API, System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource. Developers who want to track future feature development in the EventSource API should target System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource included in the latest available release of .NET runtime, currently .NET 6.\r\n \r\n## Details\r\n \r\n### How to migrate away from Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist\r\n \r\n1. For apps and libraries targeting .NET Framework ensure you are targeting at least version 4.6.2. For apps and libraries targeting\r\n .NET Standard, .NET Core, or .NET 5+ no targeting change is needed.\r\n \r\n2. Replace references in source to the namespace `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing`\r\n with `System.Diagnostics.Tracing` instead. For example\r\n \r\n```\r\nusing Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing;\r\n```\r\nshould now be\r\n```\r\nusing System.Diagnostics.Tracing;\r\n```\r\n \r\n3. Remove package references to Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracking.EventSource.Redist from project files. You can do this in Visual Studio UI by selecting References->Manage NuGet packages... , then selecting the package from the installed package list and click the uninstall button. Alternately you can use the [Uninstall command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-uninstall-package) in Visual Studio package manager. For apps developed using the .NET CLI tools you can use the [dotnet remove package command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-remove-package).\r\n \r\n### What happens if I do nothing?\r\n \r\nThe Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package should continue to work as-is, but support for the [latest major version of the package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist/6.0.0) will end November 12, 2024. After that point the package will receive no further fixes for security or any other reason. There are no known security vulnerabilities in this package but it is always possible new issues will be discovered in the future.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/227","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 \" (#227)"},{"Id":"1277625586","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-21T01:45:44","Actor":"richlander","Number":"226","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET support for Windows 7 and 8.1 will end in January 2023","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7556.

This will include `go-live`, in addition to `sts`.\r\n- Add a new `release-type` property, with immutable values of `lts` or `sts`, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nThe change will be made in two phases:\r\n\r\n- The `release-type` property, and .NET 7 EOL date, will be added on July 13th via https://github.com/dotnet/core/pull/7499.\r\n- The `support-phase` property for .NET 7 will transition from `preview` to `go-live` on September 13th.

Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking Change to .NET Packages on Winget\" (#218)"},{"Id":"1224334047","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T16:38:05","Actor":"leecow","Number":"217","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Package Maintenance\r\n\r\n.NET Core was released in June 2016, and over the last six years, many thousands of NuGet packages have been published under the .NET umbrella. Many of these packages are legacy or out-of-support already. As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered. Please see the [.NET Package Deprecation list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/net-package-deprecation.md) and use issue https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7420 to comment.\r\n\r\n## 22-June Update\r\n\r\nWe have started the 'get-clean' process beginning with DNX packages and will proceed cautiously through the older, out-of-support releases. If you believe this package is deprecated by mistake please file a new [Package Deprecation](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdotnet%2Fcore%2Fissues%2Fnew%3Fassignees%3D%26labels%3Dpackage-deprecation%26template%3D03_package_deprecation.yaml%26title%3D%255BPackageId%255D%253A%2B%255Bversion%2528s%2529%255D&data=05%7C01%7Cleecow%40microsoft.com%7C717f6f8141854cb2a90e08da52fe38d9%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637913549082767132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=jOKETWh%2FPS0YI4wFPL8ErBuGJhawlOCnkqt1QVRaty4%3D&reserved=0) Issue and share your reasoning.

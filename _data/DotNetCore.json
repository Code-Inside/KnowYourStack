You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The Team had it already running with Mono but was not satisfied with the overall performances. Therefore I was tasked with checking if the performances can be improved or finding an alternative to using Mono. \r\n\r\nAs getting CoreRT working on the XBox was an very easy task I was able to get the core module of our C# code run in a few hours. As it runs more than twice as fast compared to Mono it was decided to go ahead. PlayStation was a little bit more work but it worked after a few days and showed the same performances improvements. Unfortunately while goingon to the Switch I noticed that the ARM64 support was incomplete and using ARM was not an option because of some limitations on the target system. As the team still wanted the performances improvements I started to implement the missing parts. It took some time but I was able to get our test case running and again it was more than twice as fast as the Mono version. It does not use all .Net features therefore there are still parts missing. But as our test test case (around 5MB of C# code) was able to run for hours with the precise GC I assume it is at least a big part.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately priorities changed and this project was put on hold. After things have changed again it was decided to give a switch from Mono to CoreRT a second try. This time I although got the permission to submit anything that does not touch the various NDAs. As you might assume I needed to add code on different places including the jit itself. As anything was done on a now nearly one year old version I need to reintegrate all these changes again. But I'd like to make sure they can easily go back in the main code branch. \r\n\r\nTherefore the question on which of these changes you are interested in and what's your recommended work flow?\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"13355638829","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-31T06:48:30","Actor":"MichalStrehovsky","Repository":"dotnet/corert","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8261","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Type manager indirection EEType vs. native layout signature\" (#8261) at dotnet/corert","RelatedBody":"Both the EEType node and the native layout signature node need to store a pointer to find the type manager at runtime. \r\n\r\nFor the EEType the compiler checks if the target support relative pointers and uses an absolute or relative symbol reloc:\r\n\r\n```\r\n           if (factory.Target.SupportsRelativePointers)\r\n                objData.EmitReloc(factory.TypeManagerIndirection, RelocType.IMAGE_REL_BASED_RELPTR32);\r\n            else\r\n                objData.EmitPointerReloc(factory.TypeManagerIndirection);\r\n\r\n```\r\nBut for the layout signature node it's always an absolute reloc\r\n\r\n`objData.EmitPointerReloc(factory.TypeManagerIndirection);`\r\n\r\nBeside of this the EEType node data is only placed on windows in the read only section while the native layout signature node does this always.\r\n\r\nThis results in a little bit of trouble for me on my ARM64/Switch combination. It might be a general ARM64 issue but I am not sure about this.\r\n\r\nAnyway I end up with a static lib that contains absolute relocation's from the read-only section to the data section. When this lib is linked to the final executable the linker tells me that this relocation's can not be resolved without a dynamic relocation and that this is an error.\r\n\r\nTo get thinks running for now I am placing the native layout signature like the ee types just in the data section. I did a quick check with the linker by using a relative reloc for the native signature layouts. This works from a linker point of view but naturally fails at runtime.\r\nAs just changing the section is the easier fix for me I'd like to ask if there was a reason why the EE types do this (on non windows systems) but the native layout signatures not.\r\n"},{"Id":"13341900052","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-28T16:43:23","Actor":"jkotas","Repository":"dotnet/corert","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8256","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Survey: Native AOT\" (#8256) at dotnet/corert","RelatedBody":"Performance has been a key .NET feature.

It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone.

Sends on a WebSocket can't run concurrently, and there's a lock that protects access to shared resources, including a pooled buffer.  The code that ends a send operation returns the buffer to the pool and releases the lock, but it does so in the opposite (wrong) order.  As such, a second concurrent send could end up trying to use the buffer concurrently with the first send operation releasing it.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported as a sporadic ArgumentException that escapes from within the WebSocket implementation (from valid usage).  But in theory it could result in data corruption throughout the process, with a buffer being returned to the pool while it's still in use.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow.

I've also already sent an email to the .NET Native team with a repro and a sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nUsing a custom `ref T` returning delegate seems to trigger a build error on UWP. Consider this snippet:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic delegate ref T FieldAccessor<T>();\r\n\r\nprivate int n;\r\n\r\nprivate void Button_OnClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    FieldAccessor<int> accessor = () => ref n;\r\n\r\n    accessor() = default;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreating a blank app and just adding that code results in the following error:\r\n\r\n> ILT0005: 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\UWPNuGetPackages\\runtime.win10-x64.microsoft.net.native.compiler\\2.2.8-rel-28605-00\\tools\\x64\\ilc\\Tools\\nutc_driver.exe @\"C:\\Users\\Sergio\\source\\repos\\FieldAccessorRepro\\FieldAccessorRepro\\obj\\x64\\Release\\ilc\\intermediate\\MDIL\\FieldAccessorRepro.rsp\"' returned exit code 2\r\n\r\nYou can find a full repro project to download [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/files/5111764/FieldAccessorRepro.zip).\r\n\r\nThis bug is currently blocking one of the follow up PRs for the `Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm` package ([here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/issues/3428)), as it causes the build to just fail on UWP. I'm hoping this could be solved with some trick/workaround on the UWP side, as I'd really, really like not to be forced to alter the API surface on the .NET Standard side for a specific issue with the .NET Native compiler.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! 😊","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[.NET Native] ILT0005 build error with ref T returning delegate\" (#8273)"},{"Id":"682498755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T07:43:54","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8272","RawContent":null,"Title":"Arm64","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8272","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Arm64\" (#8272)"},{"Id":"681008915","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-18T12:38:46","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8270","RawContent":null,"Title":"removefeature:Globalization","State":"open","Body":"As ICU has a dataset of close to 30MB alone and we would need to ship and load anything I am somewhat interested in getting rid of it as invariant culture is good enough for us. \r\n\r\nremovefeature:Globalization seems to mostly do the trick but it still tries to link 6 GlobalizationNative_* functions.

I presume to start the methods would be implemented in CoreRT as somethinglike\r\n\r\n```\r\n        [UnmanagedCallersOnly(EntryPoint = \"corert_wasm_invoke_method\", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]\r\n        public static int InvokeMethod(IntPtr method, IntPtr this_arg, IntPtr methodParams, IntPtr out_exc)\r\n        {\r\n            throw new Exception(\"NYI\");\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrameworks like Uno and Blazor do a lot of interop right now, especially as interface-types is still to be specified in Wasm, but even when interface-types make it to the browser I would think there would still be a need for this.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8263","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Wasm: Efficient calls from Javascript to Dotnet\" (#8263)"},{"Id":"678914569","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-16T14:38:02","Actor":"noobshow","Number":"8262","RawContent":null,"Title":"Link CoreRT class library to WPF(.net core 3.1) App","State":"closed","Body":"Hi,\r\nI'm trying to move some of my WPF backend to net core class library to take advantage of CoreRT AOT. \r\n\r\nIn the samples, I've not seen a way to link the executable(dll in this case) to other .net apps. \r\n\r\nWill I link to it as C++ or as C#? \r\n\r\nThanks","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8262","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Link CoreRT class library to WPF(.net core 3.1) App\" (#8262)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"SDK-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"689791313","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-01T04:10:53","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"13286","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/5.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2346e8e1-402f-4861-0aff-08d83eef1d93)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: 2346e8e1-402f-4861-0aff-08d83eef1d93\r\n- **Build**: 20200831.14\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/1/2020 3:51 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 3bcbbd5b74cbeaae26b85e1b93bc65c6a046259a\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/5.0\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

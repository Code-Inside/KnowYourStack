The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

This no longer works when I upgrade my solution to use .NET 8, but only specifically breaks for Xamarin projects (i.e. has `net8.0-macos` target framework).\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone the following repo and checkout the `dotnet8/dotnet8` branch: https://github.com/jwosty/DotnetMacosNoBuildBug/tree/dotnet8/dotnet8\r\n\r\n2. Run `build.sh`.\r\n3. Observe the following failure:\r\n    ```\r\n    /usr/local/share/dotnet/packs/Microsoft.macOS.Sdk/13.3.8825-net8-rc1/targets/Xamarin.Shared.Sdk.targets(303,3): error : Both RuntimeIdentifier and RuntimeIdentifiers were passed on the command line, but only one of them can be set at a time. [/Users/jwostenberg/Code/DotnetMacosNoBuildBug/src/TestApp/TestApp.csproj]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nIt works if you change everything to use .NET 7 (or checkout the `dotnet7/dotnet7` branch). \r\n\r\nSo while this technically a breaking change, this makes sense. However, I cannot find another workaround. There's another branch, `dotnet8/rids-in-proj`, where I've attempted a workaround by setting `RuntimeIdentifiers` in the project file instead. I get the following warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/usr/local/share/dotnet/packs/Microsoft.macOS.Sdk/13.3.8825-net8-rc1/targets/Xamarin.Shared.Sdk.targets(299,3): warning : RuntimeIdentifier was set on the command line, and will override the value for RuntimeIdentifiers set in the project file. [/Users/jwostenberg/Code/DotnetMacosNoBuildBug/src/TestApp/TestApp.csproj]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is fine and I can live with, but also the following failure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets(235,5): error NETSDK1085: The 'NoBuild' property was set to true but the 'Build' target was invoked. [/Users/jwostenberg/Code/DotnetMacosNoBuildBug/src/TestLibrary/TestLibrary.csproj]\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this behavior happens on .NET 7 too (I must have been setting it via the CLI already to work around that). The same behavior happens even if you don't even set `RuntimeIdentifiers` at all for build and publish, specifically.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the publish succeeds if you change the FrameworkTarget from `net8.0-macos` to `net8.0` (however it doesn't produce an app executable).\r\n\r\n### Why do I need `--no-build`?\r\n\r\nI prefer to run separate restore, build, and publish steps, because it works well in CI. I can (and often must) first restore for all RIDS, then build the tests and the entry point application for each RID, and finally publish the actual artifact for each RID.\r\n\r\nUntil this is fixed, I will have to do full publishes for each RID, which causes unnecessary rebuilds and eats up extra CI time, especially if there are many shared projects.\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/29296\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET SDK:\r\n Version:   8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5\r\n Commit:    e7f4de8816\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\r\n OS Version:  13.5\r\n OS Platform: Darwin\r\n RID:         osx-arm64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5/\r\n\r\n.NET workloads installed:\r\n [macos]\r\n   Installation Source: SDK 8.0.100-rc.1\r\n   Manifest Version:    13.3.8825-net8-rc1/8.0.100-rc.1\r\n   Manifest Path:       /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk-manifests/8.0.100-rc.1/microsoft.net.sdk.macos/WorkloadManifest.json\r\n   Install Type:        FileBased\r\n\r\n\r\nHost:\r\n  Version:      8.0.0-rc.1.23419.4\r\n  Architecture: arm64\r\n  Commit:       92959931a3\r\n  RID:          osx-arm64\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  6.0.302 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  6.0.403 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  6.0.404 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  6.0.405 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  6.0.407 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  7.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  7.0.101 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  7.0.102 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  7.0.200 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  7.0.202 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  7.0.400 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  8.0.100-preview.7.23376.3 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.7 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.11 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.12 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.13 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.15 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.1 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.2 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.3 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.4 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.10 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.0-preview.7.23375.9 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.0-rc.1.23421.29 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.7 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.11 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.12 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.13 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.15 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.1 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.2 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.3 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.4 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.10 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0-preview.7.23375.6 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0-rc.1.23419.4 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nOther architectures found:\r\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet/x64]\r\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables:\r\n  Not set\r\n\r\nglobal.json file:\r\n  /Users/jwostenberg/Code/DotnetMacosNoBuildBug/global.json\r\n\r\nLearn more:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\r\n\r\nDownload .NET:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIDE version: N/A -

Install only ASP.Net Core Runtime Windows Hosting Bundle((7.0.11),\r\n\r\n- I have reproduce it on test server with just Hosting Bundle installed but also on my computer where I had already installed dotnet sdk(7.0.401) and I installed Hosting Bundle over it.\r\n\r\n2. From an asp.net core application hosted in local IIS, create a HttpClient with base address using sub-directory  ex. https://XXXX/api. When you want to call api, you will lose sub-directory from the request URL.\r\n\r\n3. If on dev computer uninstall the Hosting Bundle with only dotnet sdk installed, everything comes back to normal \r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  5.0.416 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.317 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  7.0.304 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  7.0.308 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  7.0.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  8.0.100-preview.5.23303.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.32 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.22 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.0-preview.5.23302.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.32 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.22 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0-preview.5.23280.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.32 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.22 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.0-preview.5.23302.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nOther architectures found:\r\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\r\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables:\r\n  Not set\r\n\r\nglobal.json file:\r\n  Not found\r\n\r\nLearn more:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\r\n\r\nDownload .NET:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\r\n  \r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.7.4\r\n \r\nEdition\tWindows 11 Enterprise\r\nVersion\t22H2\r\nInstalled on\t‎27/‎09/‎2022\r\nOS build\t22621.2283\r\nSerial number\tPF33B3FE\r\nExperience\tWindows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22662.1000.0\r\n\r\nInternet Information Services (Version 10.0,22621,1)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/35691","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Installing just ASP.Net Core Runtime Windows Hosting Bundle has different behavior than Dotnet SDK\" (#35691)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1892949870","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-12T17:22:59","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"275","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-36799: .NET Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-36799: .NET Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 7.0 and .NET 6.0.

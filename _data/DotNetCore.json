This happened accidentally as part of a performance fix in 3.x.  That fix tried to ensure a seekable stream and would copy the backing stream contents when doing so.  This was unnecessary work (and an unnecessary copy) since saving the image only requires writing and not reading nor seeking.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomer encounters `NotSupportedException` when trying to save an image when they did not before.  This is blocking service update to 3.1 for the customer as well as preventing their upstack consumers of this service from updating.\r\nWorkaround would involve saving to a `MemoryStream` then copying to the final stream, which is undesirable.  This significantly increases CPU and memory usage to a in a commonly used component low in the stack.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from 2.1: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/commit/dee434428ee392302ff2050bbee304c9fce68b2f\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests added to cover this scenario.  Partner has been using 5.0 fix.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow.  This is undoing a regression and fix has been in place in 5.0 for months.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

This happened accidentally as part of a performance fix in 3.x.  That fix tried to ensure a seekable stream and would copy the backing stream contents when doing so.  This was unnecessary work (and an unnecessary copy) since saving the image only requires writing and not reading nor seeking.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomer encounters `NotSupportedException` when trying to save an image when they did not before.  This is blocking service update to 3.1 for the customer as well as preventing their upstack consumers of this service from updating.\r\nWorkaround would involve saving to a `MemoryStream` then copying to the final stream, which is undesirable.

The benefits in doing so are smaller deployments, lower disk space usage, and in some cases improved startup performance.\r\n\r\nThis feature is implemented by a runtime package store, which is a location on disk where packages are stored, and that the runtime can find, access, and use. That location is a *store* directory, next to the `dotnet` host. Under this directory, there are subdirectories for target frameworks, under which the package store follows a NuGet layout.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the implementation is a \"target manifest\", which is a list of packages that compose a runtime package store, and that developers can target when publishing their application. The target manifest is typically provided by the owner of the targeted production environment.\r\n\r\nThe feature is also used implicitly by ASP.NET applications: the set of packages composing the ASP.NET Web framework is installed as part of the setup packages authored by Microsoft. When publishing an ASP.NET application, the published application is trimmed to only include the application's packages, and not the framework's packages.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n- Smaller deployments\r\n- Lower disk space usage\r\n- Faster startup times\r\n\r\n## Publishing an application against a target manifest\r\n\r\nIf you have a target manifest file on disk, you can specify it when publishing your app with the [`dotnet publish`](../tools/dotnet-publish.md) command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet publish --manifest path/to/the/target-manifest.xml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting published application should only be deployed to an environment that has the packages described in the target manifest. Failing to do so would result in the application not starting.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to specify multiple target manifests when publishing an application. The application will then be trimmed for the union of packages specified in those target manifests.\r\n\r\n## Specifying a target manifest in the project file\r\n\r\nInstead of specifying a target manifest in a [`dotnet publish`](../tools/dotnet-publish.md) command, it's possible to specify the manifest or manifests to use in the project file as a semicolon-separated list of paths under a `TargetManifestFiles` tag.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n  <TargetManifestFiles>path/to/the/target-manifest.xml</TargetManifestFiles>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should only be done when the target environment for the application is well-known.\r\n\r\nA different case would be an open-source project: the users of the project will likely deploy to a variety of different production environments, which may have different sets of packages pre-installed. Maintainers of the project can't make assumptions about the target manifest, and users should instead rely on the `--manifest` option of [`dotnet publish`](../tools/dotnet-publish.md) instead.\r\n\r\n## ASP.NET implicit store\r\n\r\nThe default ASP.NET targets included with the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` meta-package include target manifests. As a consequence, `dotnet publish` of an ASP.NET application when it references this package will result in a published application that contains only the application and its assets, and not ASP.NET itself.\r\n\r\nWhen an ASP.NET published application gets deployed, one should make sure that the target environment has ASP.NET installed, as the presence of .NET Core alone will not be sufficient.\r\n\r\nIf the application needs to be published to such an environment that doesn't include ASP.NET, it is possible to opt out of the implicit store by specifying a `PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest` flag set to false in the project file, as you can see in the following example.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest>false</PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ASP.NET runtime package store will be installed as part of the SDK packages distributed by Microsoft, and will also be available as a separate download so that any deployment environment can be prepared to receive published ASP.NET applications.\r\n\r\n## Preparing a runtime environment\r\n\r\nThe administrator of a runtime environment can optimize for certain types of applications by building a runtime package store and the corresponding target manifest.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to create an XML file that describes the packages that must compose the runtime package store. The format of this file is compatible with the `csproj` format. Here's an example of such a file that adds `Newtonsoft.Json` and `System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives` to the package store:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"9.0.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives\" Version=\"4.1.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe runtime package store can then be provisioned by running a `dotnet store --manifest [target-manifest.xml] --runtime [runtime id] --framework [target framework]` command. Multiple file paths can be passed to a single [`dotnet store`](../tools/dotnet-store.md) command.\r\n\r\nThe output of the command is a package store under the `.dotnet/store` subdirectory of the user profile, unless a specific location has been specified using the `--output` option. The root directory of the store contains a target manifest `artifact.xml` file, that can be made available to be downloaded by application authors who want to target this store when publishing.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/14201","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Runtime Package Store\" (#14201)"},{"Id":"723420849","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T17:54:41","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"14200","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.1.1xx' => 'release/3.1.4xx'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the release/3.1.1xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.1.4xx.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

This happened accidentally as part of a performance fix in 3.x.  That fix tried to ensure a seekable stream and would copy the backing stream contents when doing so.  This was unnecessary work (and an unnecessary copy) since saving the image only requires writing and not reading nor seeking.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomer encounters `NotSupportedException` when trying to save an image when they did not before.

This library exposes a `ToHashSet` method. Everything worked fine, until `Enumerable.ToHashSet` was also introduced in `net472`, `netcoreapp2.0` and `netstandard2.1`. Predictably, this caused an ambiguous invocation error when both the Linq.Extras and System.Linq namespaces were imported. So far so good, it makes sense.\r\n\r\nI set out to fix the issue in my library by adding additional targets without the `ToHashSet` method, but then I realized something strange: I should have encountered the problem in my tests, but I didn't. My tests target multiple TFMs, including `netcoreapp2.0`, and look roughly like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\n\r\nnamespace Linq.Extras.Tests\r\n{\r\n    public class MyTests\r\n    {\r\n        [Fact]\r\n        public void Test1()\r\n        {\r\n            IEnumerable<string> enumerable = new[]{ \"hello\", \"world\", \"HELLO\" };\r\n            var result = enumerable.ToHashSet(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNotice that in this test, both `System.Linq.Enumerable.ToHashSet` and `Linq.Extras.XEnumerable.ToHashSet` are in scope. So I should get an ambiguous invocation error... But I don't! It always uses `Linq.Extras.XEnumerable.ToHashSet`.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I can think of is that the test namespace (`Linq.Extras.Tests`) is \"under\" the namespace the contains the extension method (`Linq.Extras`). And indeed, if I change the test namespace to `Foo` and add a `using Linq.Extras`, I get the expected error.\r\n\r\nSo, is this behavior expected? Is there an overload resolution rule that prioritizes extension methods in a parent namespace?

Of course there is a different IL code between `NonIfGet`, `IfGet`, `NonIfSet` and `IfSet`. But in my opinion the difference in IL does not explain why, the larger the x in `(IInterface<ClassX>)`, the slower the casting.\r\n\r\nSpecifically I would like to know\r\n\r\n0. IL or JIT makes the difference?\r\n0. why `NonIfGet` does not depends on concrete interface?\r\n0. is it possible to modify .net to improve casting performance in other cases, because it looks like O(n) where n is a count of interfaces.\r\n\r\nCould anyone shed some light about this? Is it IL code or should I address this question in dotnet/runtime?

But we need to make sure the memory is freed when the managed thread object is collected. \r\n\r\nThe other option would be doing it in the same way as socket addresses are store. The managed part asks the native how much space is needed. It creates a byte array and every time a native call is made the array is pinned.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

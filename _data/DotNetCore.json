The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

","State":"open","Body":"Hi, since the .Net SDK is written in C#, would it be possible to build it as a class library and use in Xamarin / .Net MAUI App?\r\nMy goal is to make a .Net MAUI app in which you could write C# code, similar to [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radinc.csharpshell&hl=en_US). I know it is possible to use something like CodeDom, however it only allows you to compile C# code on the fly, not do things like installing and using .net tools. For example, if I wanted to use EF Core in the code I was writing inside my app, it would be impossible to do things like database migrations. So I came to the conclusion that, to be possible to take advantage of all the features of .Net SDK inside an app (for example, on an android device), one would need to \"just\" compile the .Net SDK as a class library, reference it in their app and ship them together.\r\nSo, I ask if it is even possible, and if yes, how could I achieve this?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/35419","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Is it possible to use the SDK inside and Xamarin/MAUI app? \" (#35419)"},{"Id":"1897455131","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-14T22:54:41","Actor":"tarekgh","Number":"35418","RawContent":null,"Title":"Metrics switch support in the SDK","State":"open","Body":"Within the Runtime, we've introduced a configuration switch called `System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Meter.IsSupported` to manage the activation and deactivation of metrics functionality.

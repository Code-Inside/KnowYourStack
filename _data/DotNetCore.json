We have a process to discuss and evaluate new feature suggestions. Here is an overview of our process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/contributing/ide_design_process.md). This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nWould be nice that members overridden by generated code wouldn't affect the override dropdown menu of the editor.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBrief summary of what this proposal is about.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWhat is the problem we are solving and in what context did you encounter it?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI'm working on a source generator that is meant to fill gaps in `Stream` implementations with boilerplate So Stream can be more user-friendly, and can guide users to implement Span-based and Task-based members (or any other members that are alignemd with \"the current meta\").\r\n\r\nSo for example if a user has the following code:\r\n```cs\r\n[GenerateStreamBoilerplate]\r\npublic partial class MyStream : Stream \r\n{ \r\n    public override int Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)\r\n    {\r\n        // do something\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will generate the following:\r\n```cs\r\npartial class MyStream\r\n{\r\n    public override bool CanRead => true;\r\n    public override bool CanSeek => false;\r\n    public override bool CanWrite => false;\r\n\r\n    public override Task<int> ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n    {\r\n        ValidateBufferArguments(buffer, offset, count);\r\n        EnsureCanRead();\r\n        \r\n        return Task.Run(() => Read(buffer, offset, count), cancellationToken);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override void Write(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Stream does not support writing.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override ValueTask WriteAsync(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> buffer, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Stream does not support writing.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // The rest of members generated are omitted for brevity.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will also emit a diagnostic saying \"'MyStream' does not implement any ReadAsync method and hence is doing async-over-sync\".\r\n\r\nTherefore we would like some of the generated members to still be shown in the override dropdown menu for the following reasons: \r\n* Users can still enjoy the UX provided by the editor\r\n* The code we provide is boilerplate and hence we don't want to discourage them from discovering the overridable members, especially the ones we just generated to reflect the not-supported operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed Feature\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a sketch of the feature you are proposing. Be as specific as you can: the more specific the proposal, the easier the process will be. Including screenshots of some of the existing problems can also help a lot here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimilar to `EditorBrowsable`, an attribute could be provided to signal that said members can still be overridden.\r\n"},{"Id":"31360597109","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-08-24T23:31:24","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69712","RelatedDescription":"Opened

public static class DateExtensions\r\n    {\r\n        public static void Test(this DateOnly d)\r\n        {\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Program.cs`\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nnamespace Brandon.Expirements\r\n{\r\n    public static class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public static void Main()\r\n        {\r\n            var d = new DateOnly();\r\n            d. //auto complete should complete DateExtensions Test method but does not.\r\n        }\r\n    }    \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`Test()` would be provided as an import option.\n\n### Environment Information\n\nOS: Windows 11\r\nVS Code Version: 1.80.2\r\nExtensionVersion: 0.2.100 (i think)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"31363441866","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-08-25T03:23:48","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/34923","RelatedDescription":"Opened

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

We have a process to discuss and evaluate new feature suggestions. Here is an overview of our process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/contributing/ide_design_process.md). This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nWould be nice that members overridden by generated code wouldn't affect the override dropdown menu of the editor.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBrief summary of what this proposal is about.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWhat is the problem we are solving and in what context did you encounter it?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI'm working on a source generator that is meant to fill gaps in `Stream` implementations with boilerplate So Stream can be more user-friendly, and can guide users to implement Span-based and Task-based members (or any other members that are alignemd with \"the current meta\").\r\n\r\nSo for example if a user has the following code:\r\n```cs\r\n[GenerateStreamBoilerplate]\r\npublic partial class MyStream : Stream \r\n{ \r\n    public override int Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)\r\n    {\r\n        // do something\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will generate the following:\r\n```cs\r\npartial class MyStream\r\n{\r\n    public override bool CanRead => true;\r\n    public override bool CanSeek => false;\r\n    public override bool CanWrite => false;\r\n\r\n    public override Task<int> ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n    {\r\n        ValidateBufferArguments(buffer, offset, count);\r\n        EnsureCanRead();\r\n        \r\n        return Task.Run(() => Read(buffer, offset, count), cancellationToken);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override void Write(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Stream does not support writing.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override ValueTask WriteAsync(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> buffer, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Stream does not support writing.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // The rest of members generated are omitted for brevity.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will also emit a diagnostic saying \"'MyStream' does not implement any ReadAsync method and hence is doing async-over-sync\".\r\n\r\nTherefore we would like some of the generated members to still be shown in the override dropdown menu for the following reasons: \r\n* Users can still enjoy the UX provided by the editor\r\n* The code we provide is boilerplate and hence we don't want to discourage them from discovering the overridable members, especially the ones we just generated to reflect the not-supported operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed Feature\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a sketch of the feature you are proposing. Be as specific as you can: the more specific the proposal, the easier the process will be.

Instead, we run generators in both processes, assuming that they must produce the same results, and thus can be referenced uniformly between processes.  While this would be an aspect of a well-written generator, it is not something that can be enforced.  As such, our synchronization story is dependent on user code, out of our control, which may not abide by the invariants we depend on.  \r\n\r\nThis is already the source of many reported issues where one process refers to a generated doc that is either missing in the other process, or which has different contents.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, we intend to make the following change:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of computing SG docs in both processes (specifically, using a generator-driver in both processes), we will only truly generate the docs in the OOP server.\r\n2. If the host process needs to get the generated documents (for example, if a local feature needs it, or some client just calls GetSourceGeneratedDocumentsAsync on the project itself), it will call out to the server to get the documents from it.\r\n\r\nFor efficiency, the host won't directly ask for all the SG documents from the OOP process.  Instead, it will ask for the list of document-ids, and document-state-checksums.  Similar to normal syncing, those ids/checksums will be compared to those cached locally (from the prior project state).  Any that are the same can be used directly from the prior state.  Any that are gone can be removed.  And any that are new or changed can have their contents then be queried from the OOP process doing the expensive sync only for those.\r\n\r\nWith this change, it will always be the case that the host and server agree on the SG doc contents for any particular solution snapshot.  Messages referring to these documents that happen in either direction will always be sure to succeed at that point.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69694","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Only run Source-Generator driver in external process.\" (#69694)"},{"Id":"1864194043","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-24T00:43:13","Actor":"cston","Number":"69693","RawContent":null,"Title":"Collection expressions: Report warning when the compiler generates a heap allocation for a ref struct","State":"open","Body":"Report a warning when the compiler generates a heap allocation for a collection expression with a `ref struct` target type.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the collection expression in the following will result in a heap allocation for an `object[]` when compiling with .NET 7 or earlier.\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nclass Program\r\n{\r\n    static void Main()\r\n    {\r\n        Print([1, 2, 3]);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    static void Print(ReadOnlySpan<object> items)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69412#discussion_r1303396806","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69693","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Collection expressions: Report warning when the compiler generates a heap allocation for a ref struct\" (#69693)"},{"Id":"1864186185","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-24T00:31:21","Actor":"cston","Number":"69692","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove WellKnownMembers.System_ReadOnlySpan_T__op_Implicit_ReadOnlySpan_T_Array if not needed","State":"open","Body":"Remove `WellKnownMembers.System_ReadOnlySpan_T__op_Implicit_ReadOnlySpan_T_Array` and replace with `WellKnownMembers.System_ReadOnlySpan_T__ctor_Array` if equivalent.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69412#discussion_r1297631352","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69692","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Remove WellKnownMembers.System_ReadOnlySpan_T__op_Implicit_ReadOnlySpan_T_Array if not needed\" (#69692)"},{"Id":"1864116126","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-23T22:47:25","Actor":"333fred","Number":"69689","RawContent":null,"Title":"AdditionalFile fixers don't run on up-to-date versions of documents","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: C# ext v2.0.419\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1.

(v7.0.400)\r\n* What OS and version, and for Linux, what distro? (Windows 11 v23H2)\r\n* What is the architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64)?

(does not apply)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nI doubt it ever worked since Microsoft intended way for us to write tests is to have a solution folder and then a bunch of different projects.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-08-25T03:30:17.8955777Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":7536}

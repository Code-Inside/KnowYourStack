These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across the .NET framework. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership. Your contributions are essential to strengthening the security of .NET, and we look forward to your future submissions.\n\nThanks\n\n_Madeline Eckert, MSRC and Barry Dorrans, .NET Security_"},{"Id":"52121394499","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-07-15T17:45:44","Actor":"jongalloway","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/364","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET 10 Preview 6\" (#364) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9974.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

When suppressing BL0005 with #pragma warning disable BL0005, the IDE0079 analyzer incorrectly reports this as an \"unnecessary suppression\" even though the suppression is necessary. This creates a catch-22 situation where:\n1. If you keep the BL0005 suppression, you get an IDE0079 warning\n2. If you remove the suppression as suggested, you get the BL0005 warning back\n\n```cs\n[Fact]\npublic void ComponentTest()\n{\n    var cut = RenderComponent<SomeComponent>();\n    var inputNumber = cut.FindComponent<InputNumber<int>>();\n\n    // If this line is not suppressed, BL0005 is triggered\n    #pragma warning disable BL0005 // Component parameter should not be set outside of its component\n    inputNumber.Instance.Value = 0;\n    #pragma warning restore BL0005\n\n    // IDE0079 incorrectly says the above suppression is unnecessary\n    // But removing it causes BL0005 warning\n}\n```\n\n**Version Used**: 9.0.300\n\n**Steps To Reproduce**:\n\n1. Create a Blazor test project with bUnit\n2. Create a test that directly sets a component parameter value\n3. Add #pragma warning disable BL0005 to suppress the component parameter warning\n4. Observe that IDE0079 reports the suppression as \"unnecessary\"\n5. Remove the suppression, and BL0005 warning reappears\n\n**Diagnostic Id**: \n\n[IDE0079](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0079): `Remove unnecessary suppression`\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n\nIDE0079 should recognize that BL0005 suppressions are necessary when component parameters are directly set in test code and not flag them as \"unnecessary suppressions\".\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n\nDE0079 incorrectly flags necessary BL0005 suppressions, forcing developers to either:\n1.\tAdd another suppression for IDE0079 (#pragma warning disable IDE0079)\n2.\tIgnore one of the warnings\n3.\tRestructure tests to avoid direct parameter setting (not always feasible)\n\n**Additional Context**:\n\n•\tThis occurs specifically in Blazor component testing scenarios\n•\tThe issue appears to be in how IDE0079 evaluates suppression necessity in Blazor contexts\n•\tCurrent workaround is to add both suppressions:\n\n  ```cs\n  #pragma warning disable IDE0079 // Remove unnecessary suppression\n  #pragma warning disable BL0005 // Component parameter should not be set outside of its component\n  // Code that would trigger BL0005\n  #pragma warning restore BL0005\n  #pragma warning restore IDE0079\n  ```\n\nManually migrated from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/7718","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79854","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IDE0079 incorrectly flags necessary BL0005 warning suppressions in Blazor component tests\" (#79854)"},{"Id":"3304365731","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-08T15:04:50","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"79853","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'main' => 'main-vs-deps'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the main branch which have not been merged yet to main-vs-deps.

While `dotnet run` on the command line will find and use launchSettings.json, it treats the property as an empty stringdoes not expand the property that works in the IDEs.\n\nI can't find any documentation on launchSettings.json's commandLineArgs, so if it's intentional that properties that work in VS and VSCode should not work on the CLI, I can't find evidence, and I don't find it intuitive. Asking Copilot, it gave me an answer that's factually wrong. Using bing search results, the closest docs I could find were the container tools launch settings docs, but it doesn't say what replacement tokens are available for CommandLineArgs.  Going to dotnet run command's docs, it has a link to asp.net core's docs (which bing itself didn't show on the first page of search results), and when I follow the link, their docs don't mention commandLineArgs at all.\n\nDoing `dotnet run -bl` does create a binlog, but it stops at the build, which makes sense. But the properties available in the build are being replaced with empty strings at run, and I can't figure out how else to debug to investigate for myself which properties, if any, are available when running from the CLI.\n\nMy end goal is that I have a console app that takes an output directory as a command line argument. I want to set up the default launch settings to use a specific directory within the source control repo, so it doesn't matter if I launch from an IDE, or if I launch on the command line with the working directory being the project directory, the solution directory, or elsewhere, in all cases the default argument provided to the console app is consistently the same location.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nsrc/MyApp/Program.cs\n```cs\nif (args.Length != 1)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: Program <input>\");\n    return 1;\n}\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Raw argument: \" + args[0]);\n\nvar path = Path.GetFullPath(args[0]);\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Repo root: {path}\");\n\nreturn 0;\n```\n\nthe csproj is just the default `dotnet new console`. no changes needed.\n\nsrc/MyApp/Properties/launchSettings.json\n```json\n{\n  \"profiles\": {\n    \"launchSettings\": {\n      \"commandName\": \"Project\",\n      \"commandLineArgs\": \"$(ProjectDir)\\\\..\\\\..\\\\\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo matter how I run the project, when launchSettings.json is used, I want the \"repo root\" output to be the same. I also tried MSBuildProjectDirectory, which is an MSBuild reserved property that always has a value (when using MSBuild, obviously).\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\nN/A\n\n### Further technical details\n<details><summary>details of dotnet --info</summary>\n<p>\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-preview.6.25358.103\n Commit:            75972a5ba7\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.cc13e7a2\n MSBuild version:   17.15.0-preview-25358-103+75972a5ba\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-preview.6.25358.103\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\nWorkloads are configured to install and update using workload versions, but none were found.

While it may seem like a minor issue, this really could force a large project that I really want to use Blazor+Aspire for onto Angular.  I have tried:\n* Adding <script src=\"/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js\"></script>.  this just results in it being loaded twice\n* `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`  This was already done but I did again, and confirmed the cert was trusted.\n* Disabling auto-save in VSCode\n* Updating to dotnet SDK latest (9.0.304) and aspire latest (9.4)\n* Both Mac and Windows have same behavior\n* both dotnet watch and aspire run --watch --debug show same stack trace\n* Running dotnet watch on the individual projects (ASP.NET API and ASP.NET Blazor WASM) does not exhibit this behavior.  \n\n I can run on the individual projects, but then lose the benefits of Aspire!  This [aspnetcore ticket seems related](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/37462), but since this is only happening when aspire is involved, I'm opening ticket here.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo error.  Changing files in either API or Blazor project results in HMR and blazor app refreshes.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/danroot/Spike.AspireWatchIssue I wrote a minimal repro here, but am getting a different error and behavior.  There, dotnet watch won't start at all.

This prevented users from overriding default cache behavior for common file types like `*.html` and `*.js`.\n\nThe issue occurred in the `TryGetMapping` method where built-in mappings were checked first:\n\n```csharp\nif (_builtInMappings.TryGetValue(match.Pattern, out mapping) || _customMappings.TryGetValue(match.Pattern, out mapping))\n```\n\nSince built-in mappings for `*.html` and `*.js` have `Cache = null`, they would always win over custom mappings that might specify cache headers like `\"no-cache\"` or `\"max-age=3600\"`.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe fix swaps the lookup order to check custom mappings first:\n\n```csharp\nif (_customMappings.TryGetValue(match.Pattern, out mapping) || _builtInMappings.TryGetValue(match.Pattern, out mapping))\n```\n\nThis minimal one-line change ensures that:\n- Custom mappings take precedence over built-in mappings when both exist\n- User configuration properly overrides defaults as expected\n- Built-in mappings still serve as fallbacks when no custom mapping exists\n- No breaking changes to existing functionality\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded comprehensive regression tests to verify:\n- Custom `*.html` mappings with cache settings override built-in mappings\n- Custom `*.js` mappings with cache settings override built-in mappings  \n- Custom mappings work correctly for compressed files (`.gz`)\n- All existing functionality continues to work as before\n\nThis restores the expected behavior from SDK versions 9.0.101–9.0.205 where user configuration properly overrode built-in defaults.\n\nFixes #50152.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

It does not change the special handling for fingerprinted assets (those still get immutable).\n\nSuggested tests\n\nAdd a regression test to cover precedence and cache usage. Extending the existing ContentTypeProviderTests is sufficient and lightweight.\nExample additions:\n\nVerify that a custom \"*.html\" mapping with a non-null Cache is returned and used (ensures precedence over built-in):\nCreate ContentTypeProvider with new[] { new ContentTypeMapping(\"text/html\", \"no-store, must-revalidate, no-cache\", \"*.html\", 2) }.\nResolve for \"index.html\" and assert mapping.Cache equals the custom value.\nOptionally, cover compressed paths to ensure the same precedence applies with .gz:\nResolve for \"index.html.gz\" and assert mapping.Cache equals the custom value.\nBehavior change note\n\nThis is a user-visible behavioral change for projects relying on built-in defaults winning over custom mappings, but it restores the previous (9.0.101–9.0.205) and expected behavior where user configuration overrides the built-ins.\nNotes about code search\n\nI inspected the current implementation in the repo to reach this conclusion. The code search results shown here may be incomplete; for a full view, browse the repository search directly: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adotnet%2Fsdk%20ContentTypeProvider&type=code\nOpen question for review\n\nbaronfel: any preference on whether we also flip the registration order in the matcher (AddIncludePatternsList) or is swapping the lookup order sufficient for clarity? The lookup swap alone works and is the smallest change.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50152","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Static Web Assets] Respect custom content-type mappings\" (#50152)"},{"Id":"3306439985","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-09T14:37:02","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"50151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix Vary header in Static Web Assets compression negotiation to use Accept-Encoding","State":"open","Body":"This PR fixes the Vary header value in Static Web Assets compression negotiation from \"Content-Encoding\" to \"Accept-Encoding\" to follow proper HTTP semantics.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe `ApplyCompressionNegotiation` task was incorrectly setting the Vary header to \"Content-Encoding\" when serving compressed static web assets.

These options are processed by the dotnet CLI itself and properly transformed before being passed to individual test applications, rather than being blindly forwarded.\r\n\r\n## New Options Added\r\n\r\nThe following options are now available when using Microsoft Testing Platform:\r\n\r\n- `--config-file <CONFIG_FILE>` - The testconfig.json configuration file to use for test execution\r\n- `--diagnostic-output-directory <DIAGNOSTIC_DIR>` - Directory where diagnostic output will be placed  \r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThe implementation follows the same pattern established by the existing `--results-directory` option (from #50081):\r\n\r\n1. **Path Transformation**: Options that accept file/directory paths (`--config-file`, `--diagnostic-output-directory`) are automatically converted from relative to absolute paths using `Path.GetFullPath()` based on the current working directory.\r\n\r\n2. **Global Processing**: These options are handled by the dotnet CLI and not included in the forwarded MSBuild arguments, ensuring they are processed consistently across all test projects.\r\n\r\n3. **Microsoft Testing Platform Only**: The new options only appear when using Microsoft Testing Platform (determined by `dotnet.config` file with `[dotnet.test.runner] name = Microsoft.Testing.Platform`). VSTest continues to work unchanged.\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Enable Microsoft Testing Platform\r\necho -e \"[dotnet.test.runner]\\nname = Microsoft.Testing.Platform\" > dotnet.config\r\n\r\n# Use the new global options\r\ndotnet test \\\r\n  --solution MySolution.sln \\\r\n  --config-file path/to/testconfig.json \\\r\n  --diagnostic-output-directory diagnostics \\\r\n  --results-directory TestResults\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, if run from `/repo/root`, the relative paths are transformed to:\r\n- `--config-file /repo/root/path/to/testconfig.json`\r\n- `--diagnostic-output-directory /repo/root/diagnostics` \r\n- `--results-directory /repo/root/TestResults`\r\n\r\nThis ensures that all test projects receive absolute paths pointing to the same directories relative to where `dotnet test` was invoked, regardless of the individual project locations.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Options appear correctly in `dotnet test --help` when using Microsoft Testing Platform\r\n- Options are properly excluded from VSTest to maintain backward compatibility\r\n- Path transformation handles both relative and absolute paths correctly\r\n- Build passes without errors or warnings\r\n\r\nPart of #49709.\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\r\n---\r\n\r\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-08-11T03:30:17.0654103Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":7058}

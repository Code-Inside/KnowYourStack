The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

In a Blazor app, add a non-async, void-returning EventCallback handler in your C# code and reference it via the relevant EventCallback Parameter in the .razor code (e.g. add an OnClick handler to a button)\r\n2. Modify the body of the method added in step 1 by typing out a call to `await Task.Delay(1000);`.\r\n3. Notice that the signature of the method has been changed from `void` to `async void` and there are no errors or warnings in the IDE or build output at either the callsite in razor or the method signature in C#.\r\n\r\n(note that this is just one example where the trap you fall into is easy to hit, but there are likely others)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\nSince the generally accepted guidance is to avoid `async void` methods whenever possible (with some limited exceptions for event handlers, etc), I would expect that doing the above steps would either:\r\n\r\n1. NOT add the async, so that I am prompted with squiggles/warnings/errors to correct my signature and I can take note of changing the entire signature correctly, OR\r\n2. Change `void` to `Task` in addition to adding `async` so that I am in the more-likely-correct state for that method and if it conflicts with the callsite I will get squiggles/warnings/errors that lead me to address it there as well.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\n`async` is added, but there are no squiggles/warnings/errors telling me that I _likely_ need to change something else as well. \r\n\r\nI just fell into this trap in https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/819 (See https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/819#discussion_r1395303542) where I converted an existing void method to `async` and let VS handle that and didn't notice that I should do more. Frankly saying I let VS handle it is probably too strong - VS handled it without me even really noticing, and I _really_ didn't notice because there weren't the expected squiggles/warnings/errors after adding await calls to a non-async method.\r\n\r\nOf course, ultimately its on me (and my reviewers) to notice these things and I will now be more careful in the future. And I know there were previous discussions about this when the feature was implemented. But it feels like from a tooling perspective we could do better to not guide users right into the trap so I figured it was worth bringing up again.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70866","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`await` completion in C# `void` method doesn't change `void` to `Task` when adding `async`\" (#70866)"},{"Id":"1997428041","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-16T17:48:26","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"70865","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consider an alternative representation for binary expressions in the syntax model","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nThe IDE has found that we effectively cannot ever write a recursive algorithm that processes syntax trees (which also includes using the SyntaxWalker or SyntaxRewriter classes).  This is because in *realistic*, *non-pathological* cases, we encounter trees that contain node-paths so long, that any sort of recursion blows the stack.  Specifically, the node paths are all similar to the form:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nT X =\r\n    \"...\" +\r\n    \"...\" + \r\n    \"...\" + \r\n    // etc\r\n    \"...\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, the user has a large, repetitive expression that they either generated, or they built manually.  This is very common with string expressions (where people like to break things into lines), but also occurs with other binary operators.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, because we chose to represent these expressions with an unbalanced tree, we end up with the following\r\n\r\n```\r\n        +\r\n\"...\"    +\r\n \"...\"    +\r\n  \"...\"    +\r\n//etc\r\n            +\r\n      \"...\"   \"...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all other places where we see long lists of constructs, we have actually used lists in the syntax model, not unbalanced trees.  For example, we are never really gated on hte number of statements in a block, since that's represented as a `SyntaxList<StatementSyntax>` and processing that list is practically done with iteration, not recursion.\r\n \r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nThe proposal here is fairly drastic, but i think worth consideration.  I think we should effectively stop producing BinaryExpression nodes (marking them as obsolete), and move to a new `NAryExpression` node like so:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n\r\n+[Obsolete(\"No longer created\")]\r\npublic sealed class BinaryExpressionSyntax : ExpressionSyntax\r\n{\r\n    public ExpressionSyntax Left { get; }\r\n    public ExpressionSyntax Right { get; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n+public sealed class NAryExpressionSyntax : ExpressionSyntax\r\n+{\r\n+    public SeparatedSyntaxList<ExpressionSyntax> Expressions { get; }\r\n+}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change here is that instead of producing unbalanced binary trees for long expressions like the one above, we would instead then produce a linear sequence of `\"...\"` `+` `\"...\"` `+` etc. within the NAryExpressionSyntax.\r\n\r\nWe would only produce such a sequence for all the consecutive expressions using the same operator (and as such the same precedence).  In other words, if you had:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\na * b * c * d + e + f + g + h\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would be represented as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                      NAryExpression (SyntaxKind.AddExpression)\r\n                     /                                         \\\r\n                    /                                      + e + f + g + h\r\n  NAryExpression (SyntaxKind.MultiplyExpression)               \r\n                     |\r\n               a * b * c * d\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this would still be much better, with only one level of nesting, instead of 8.  \r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nRisks are very large here.  We'd be effectively dramatically changing the syntax we create for a core case.  We have stated from the beginning that that is something we might do, but we've never done so before.  \r\n\r\nHowever, my feeling is htat this is worth it.  Primarily because the existing model is problematic for *everyone*.   Compiler, IDE, and all our analyzer authors end up constantly having to work around this all the time.  And we continually get stack overflow issues from release to release where this is missed.  Since everyone has has to deal with this anyways, and it's an ongoing tax to do so, we might as well bite the bullet and move to this safer model.\r\n\r\nAs a plus, it means that we no longer have to ban certain APIs from being used as they would now be effectively safe for real world code.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70865","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider an alternative representation for binary expressions in the syntax model\" (#70865)"},{"Id":"1997399570","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-16T17:30:36","Actor":"jeromelaban","Number":"70863","RawContent":null,"Title":"EnC workspace does not report on generators diagnostics","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: 4.8.0-3.final\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. `dotnet new blazorwasm -o testblazor01`\r\n1. `cd testblazor01` \r\n1.

The SDK Container feature opts into this mode by default, inspecting the base images for this value and setting it in our generated images on behalf of the user.\r\n\r\nBecause this is an impactful change, we also created a mechanism to allow users to opt out of this behavior. Users set `<ContainerUser>root</ContainerUser>` in their project file or their build command and we take that and flow it through the container creation process accordingly.\r\n\r\nOr at least we used to. At some point we messed up the sequencing and since we never had an end-to-end test for the way that the implicit user id for the base image interacted with the feature we released in a broken state.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nUsers building containers with the SDK always build containers in rootless mode, and the MSBuild switch to opt out of this has no effect. If the user code does things that require admin permissions, for example creating files in the application's working directory), the application may crash. There are two workarounds:\r\n\r\n* As part of container execution (so long after the build), have your container runtime (docker, kubernetes, etc) explicitly run the SDK-generated container image as a user with root permissions. For example, here is how you might run a container as the `root` user: `docker run --user root my-webapp:latest`. This requires users to find and alter their deployment steps, which may not be located with their code.\r\n* Update the application to work in a rootless mode of execution. This can vary wildly in terms of effort. While this is the long-term best option from a security perspective, most users will likely want to schedule and plan for such changes.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\n**Yes** - this probably broke as a result of the changes introduced in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/34154 prior to RC1.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low** - tests cover the changes and this path is only hit when a user is explicitly asking for a change.\r\n\r\n## Verification/Testing\r\n\r\nAutomated tests now verify the expected changes to image manifest configurations and enforce the expected ordering of implicit user id selection vs explicit user-provided actions.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/36974","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Don't overwrite user-provided ContainerUser values\" (#36974)"},{"Id":"1997581239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-16T19:19:29","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"36973","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/8.0.1xx' => 'release/8.0.2xx'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the release/8.0.1xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/8.0.2xx.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

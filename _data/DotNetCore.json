These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across the .NET framework. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

I could add this suggestion and it might be a solution to the wrong problem. The original ticket needs to have commenting reenabled so people can propose solutions, other people can explain why it isn't a solution (or isn't even the right problem) and so on.\n\n# Suggestion 2\nFody had this problem solved a long time ago. You can specify the weavers in sequential order, each is given a mutable model, each can change the model along the way. It doesn't generate source code that needs to be reparsed, it just lets you change the model along the way.\n\nI would say add a new type concept\n```c#\n[Generator] // Only if you need to, I'd prefer not to\npublic class Example : IModuleMutator\n{\n  public void Process(ModuleDefinition module, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n  {\n    return module;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `ModuleDefinition` is the whole source code as symbols, and it is mutable. Each Mutator can change the ModuleDefinition in any way it wants\n\n- Add new classes\n- Add new members\n- Delete classes / members\n- Remove dependencies\n- Add dependencies\n- Change code inside methods\n\nOnce finished, it passes on to the next `IModuleMutator` to do what it needs to do. Ultimately, that is what gets passed on to the compiler for it to generate the binaries. \n\nOr maybe have them as immutable, and have the `IModuleMutator` pass back a mutated version of the model that represents the source code. This would be a good option if you wanted to do a diff at the end and then output the changes as human readable text (like saving generated source to disk for version control).\n\nEither way, this approach would be fast enough for it to run on a single thread through all of the mutators.\n\nNot sure whether you'd want to run this before or after the existing code generators but, either way, I would suggest having the approach migrate away from the current over time and towards this newer approach. People will be happy to be able to progressively add to the code model and even subtract from it.\n\nAnd if it were run\n1: On save\n2: On build\n3: After a 3 second typing debounce (put this as a beta option in VS that is disabled by default)\n\nI am sure this would be fast enough.  Certainly faster than running all those incremental generators, caching output at each step to check for changes, and then having it generate source code that needs to be re-parsed into the compilation.\n\nIt would be a non-breaking change, and you'd only have to perform this step if there are any IModuleMutators registered\n\n1: Parse source\n2: If any module mutators\n  2A: Convert the Roslyn model the mutable ModuleDefinition\n  2B: Run it through all module mutators\n  2C: Convert it back to the current Roslyn model\n3: Run existing pipeline\n\nMany people would be satisfied by having the Razor processor converted over to a Module Mutator so its changes appear to their Roslyn code generators, and many more would be happy they have more flexibility.\n\n\n\n# Suggestion 1 (solution to the wrong problem)\nFody achieves ordering using a Weavers.xml file. I'd suggest encoding this information into the csproj and supporting it in the Solution Explorer.\n\n<img width=\"1096\" height=\"1456\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f5c0bb5-d744-48c4-87a5-31938ae8332f\" />\n\nLooking at the analyzers in the solution explorer, allow the dev to drag an analyzer down from the default area into the Post-Build node, supporting dropping it between items already in the Post-Build section.\nOnce in there, the user can drag and drop the analyzers into the order they want them executed.\nThis information is stored as a node inside the csproj, so you know to run the analyzers as you currently do, and then afterwards run the Post-Build analyzers in order of appearance.\n\n# Optional addition 1\nYou could have attributes like this\n```c#\n[RoslynRunAfter(\"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.RazorCompiler\", ErrorLevel=RoslynRunOrderErrorLevel.Error)] // Cannot suppress\n[RoslynRunAfter(\"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.RazorCompiler\", ErrorLevel=RoslynRunOrderErrorLevel.Suggestion)] // May suppress\n```\n\n# Optional addition 2 (Visual Studio UX)\nThis way an analyzer dev can say they want to ensure (or at least suggest) their code generator runs after other specific generators.\nIf the user drops the analyzer in before/after the specified analyzer then it shows either an error or a warning on the icon of the analyzer, with a hint \"Error: Must run after analyzer X\" or \"Warning: Recommended to run after analyzer X\".\n\nIf the level is Error, you might even put in some nice UI so that when the user starts to drag, the list of Post-Build analyzers can be shaded red to indicate you cannot drop it there. If it is Warning then you could colour the acceptable area green - if none of the existing Post-Build analyzers match the attributes then don't bother showing any colour coding.\n\nThere is also the option that we already have for project build order. Where even though project Y does not reference project X it needs to be built before it.\n\nIf neither of these are a solution to the actual problem, can you please reenable commenting on the original ticket and explain the problem?"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"53973212048","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T19:49:44","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50535","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[release/10.0.1xx] [BrowserRefresh] Handle gzip-compressed responses in ResponseStreamWrapper\" (#50535) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Backport of #50452 to release/10.0.1xx\n\n/cc @MackinnonBuck @Copilot"},{"Id":"53973017680","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T19:44:36","Actor":"tmat","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50534","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Port Hot Reload changes from main\" (#50534) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Port https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49611 and https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49974 from main"},{"Id":"53969057759","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T18:03:08","Actor":"MackinnonBuck","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50451","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[BrowserRefresh] Handle the case where the document is already pre-compressed\" (#50451) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/aaa06cce0cb61ce6ef628c7ab8e1af7bbf9ab00d/src/BuiltInTools/BrowserRefresh/ResponseStreamWrapper.cs#L113-L135\n\nWhen the browser refresh middleware checks for writes, it doesn't check if the document has a content encoding and corrupts its contents.\n\nOn first write, the stream should check the response content encoding and do the following:\n* Remove the Content-Lengh header.\n* Remove the Content-Encoding header.\n* If the response has a Content-Encoding, create a decompression stream.

When a response had a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header, the middleware would inject the script directly into the compressed stream, resulting in corrupted content.\n\n## Changes\n\nThis PR implements proper handling of gzip-compressed responses:\n\n1. **Gzip Detection**: The `OnWrite()` method now detects `Content-Encoding: gzip` headers on HTML responses\n2. **Header Management**: Removes both `Content-Length` and `Content-Encoding` headers when gzip compression is detected\n3. **Streaming Decompression**: Attempts decompression on every write operation to process data as it becomes available\n4. **Graceful Fallback**: If decompression fails (partial data), continues accumulating until complete data is available\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe solution processes gzip data incrementally by attempting decompression on each write operation. When a complete gzip stream is available, it decompresses the content, injects the refresh script, and writes the result to the output stream. This approach:\n\n- Minimizes buffering by processing data as soon as possible\n- Handles only gzip compression (ignores brotli, deflate, etc.)\n- Preserves original functionality for uncompressed responses\n- Falls back gracefully for incomplete gzip data\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded test coverage for:\n- Gzip compressed HTML responses (script injection works)\n- Non-HTML gzip responses (unchanged)\n- Non-gzip compression types (treated as regular data)\n- Uncompressed HTML responses (existing functionality)\n\nAll tests pass (64 total).\n\nFixes #50451.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

A compression level of \"No compression\" is used to make this re-compression efficient.\r\n* The low compression level means HTML responses still contain some plaintext. This allows the hot reload script injection logic to detect the closing `</body>` tag and insert a `<script>` into the response.\r\n* Because the response was compressed, it gets corrupted by the inserted script and the browser fails to load the page.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, there are two high-level changes in this PR:\r\n* Hot reload middleware now decompresses HTML responses if gzip compression is detected\r\n* The script injection logic now correctly handles the case where the closing `</body>` tag is split between multiple writes to the response stream (long-standing issue)\r\n    * This is a precautionary change to prevent increased stream segmentation from causing script injection to fail more frequently than it did previously\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50451\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58940\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers impacted by this bug will experience the browser failing to load pages served via `MapStaticAssets()`. They will need to perform one of the following workarounds during development:\r\n* Explicitly disable the feature that re-compresses static assets if they get changed at runtime\r\n* Disable hot reload\r\n\r\nMany customers have reported running into the bug since it was introduced in .NET 9. At the time of writing, https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58940 has at least 11 reactions from the community.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\nThis bug has existed since the introduction of `MapStaticAssets()` in .NET 9. However, it blocks many customers from migrating away from the older static files middleware.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- [ ] High\r\n- [ ] Medium\r\n- [x] Low\r\n\r\nThe feature has thorough automated tests. Manual validation has also confirmed that:\r\n* The original bug is fixed\r\n* Script injection succeeds when the response is compressed\r\n* Hot reload continues to function normally\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\n- [x] Manual (required)\r\n- [x] Automated\r\n\r\n## Packaging changes reviewed?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n- [x] N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50535","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/10.0.1xx] [BrowserRefresh] Handle gzip-compressed responses in ResponseStreamWrapper\" (#50535)"},{"Id":"3364479483","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T19:44:35","Actor":"tmat","Number":"50534","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port Hot Reload changes from main","State":"open","Body":"Port https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49611 and https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49974 from main","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50534","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Port Hot Reload changes from main\" (#50534)"},{"Id":"3364135377","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T17:32:51","Actor":"akoeplinger","Number":"50533","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove NETStandard.Library.Ref from Version.Details.xml/.props","State":"open","Body":"This won't get updated anymore and we're already setting/overriding NETStandardLibraryRefPackageVersion in Versions.props","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50533","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Remove NETStandard.Library.Ref from Version.Details.xml/.props\" (#50533)"},{"Id":"3363441291","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T13:58:05","Actor":"jjonescz","Number":"50532","RawContent":null,"Title":"[10.0.1xx] Disable static graph restore for file-based apps","State":"open","Body":"Backport of #50245.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50532","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[10.0.1xx] Disable static graph restore for file-based apps\" (#50532)"},{"Id":"3363434796","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T13:56:19","Actor":"jjonescz","Number":"50531","RawContent":null,"Title":"[10.0.1xx] Consolidate default verbosity of msbuild-based commands","State":"open","Body":"Backport of #50243.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50531","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[10.0.1xx] Consolidate default verbosity of msbuild-based commands\" (#50531)"},{"Id":"3363425210","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T13:53:31","Actor":"jjonescz","Number":"50530","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support `-getProperty` and friends with file-based apps","State":"open","Body":"Resolves https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50501.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50530","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support `-getProperty` and friends with file-based apps\" (#50530)"},{"Id":"3363408865","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-28T13:48:39","Actor":"NitinDevgirikar","Number":"50529","RawContent":null,"Title":"JsonException: '0x00' is an invalid start of a value.","State":"open","Body":"JsonException: '0x00' is an invalid start of a value.

It refactors the logic for filtering options and adds new tests to verify this behavior.\r\n\r\n### Option filtering and help output improvements\r\n\r\n* Refactored the `GetAllOptions` method in `TestingPlatformCommand.Help.cs` to accept the command's options as input and filter out any options that are already present, ensuring no duplicates appear in the help output.\r\n* Updated the call to `GetAllOptions` in the custom help layout to pass the current command's options, aligning with the new filtering logic.\r\n\r\n### Testing enhancements\r\n\r\n* Added a new test `RunHelpCommand_ShouldNotShowDuplicateOptions` in `Test/GivenDotnetTestBuildsAndRunsHelp.cs` to verify that specific options (such as `--output` and `--no-ansi`) appear only once in the help output, preventing regressions.\r\n* Implemented a helper method `CountOptionOccurrences` to count the occurrences of an option in the help output for use in assertions in the new test.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50524","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Clean up duplicate options in dotnet test\"

Please describe.\n\nThe introduction of platform-specific .NET tools in .NET 10 preview 6 and preview 7 is great, and provides the nice capability for producing self-contained and native AOT tools. However, these rely on Version 2 of the DotNetToolSettings.xml file, which is _only_ supported on .NET 10.\n\nBecause the \"meta\" package also requires version 2, there's no way to use these packages for customers that have previous SDKs installed. So .NET Tool authors are stuck with a choice: provide maximum compatibility, and produce a framework-dependent package, or _only_ support the .NET 10+ SDK, and get the benefits of the other packages.\n\nAs a tool author that's concerned about compatibility, this likely means I will never be able to adopt the new capabilities.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_Ideally_ it would be possible to have the best of both worlds: maximum compatibility for customers on <.NET 10 SDK, and maximum performance for customers on the .NET 10 SDK.\n\nI think there's a middle ground that can be found, similar to the following:\n- Produce the platform-specific packages as we do today in .NET 10\n- Produce the root \"meta\" package that points to each of the platform-specific packages\n  - Ensure that the _DotNetToolSettings.xml_ file is placed in the `tools/net10.0` folder (instead of the `tools/<tfm>` folder as it is today\n  - Allow optionally packaging one or more framework-dependent platform-agnostic instance of the app in `tools/net5.0` (or whatever tfm is required)\n\nThis isn't _ideal_ because the root package gets larger, but it has the advantage of actually being usable in earlier SDKs. Unfortunately, unless Version 1 of DotNetToolSettings.xml supports the \"delegating\" approach, I'm not sure there's a truly optimal option.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI manually hacked together a package that does the above:\n\n<img width=\"1331\" height=\"747\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/315e7c4b-1b64-48b6-bd32-7ebd2bc5d787\" />\n\nYou pay the size-cost of a single TFM in the root package, but then the platform-specific package can be native aot compiled (for example):\n\n<img width=\"759\" height=\"110\" alt=\"Image\"

The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.3  Runtime or .NET 9.0.103 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0  Runtime or .NET 9.0.100 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

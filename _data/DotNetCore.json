The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

Furthermore, I confirmed that it is only where I am comparing a nullable type using that function and I am guessing that I missed a thread someone opened on this issue. I am aware .NET core 2.2 is not LTS. I also thought this goes here because it's not AFAIK, an EF core issue but rather an Ienumerable/Linq issue.\r\n\r\nUpdate: As it turns out your notion of `DateTime.Now` getting evaluated twice is true. To rectify that, I will now be using `DateTime.Now.Date`. This is odd because this exact code works on 4.6.1. You're probably right. SMH. Thank you @GrabYourPitchforks!

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

A fix would be nice]\nWhen using the new C# 14 extension method syntax, Visual Studio 18.0.2 marks private extension methods as \"unused members\" but only _if it is not called using the extension method signature_.\nSurely this is the side-effect of some compiler lowering to old-style extension syntax, but the IDE suggestion is just wrong and would lead to a compiler error.\n\nExample:\n\n```csharp\npublic static class NewStyleExtensions\n{\n    extension(string input)\n    {\n        public T[] SplitToArray&lt;T&gt;(char separator) where T : IConvertible\n            =&gt; [.. input.Split(separator).Select(ConvertTo&lt;T&gt;)];\n\n        private T ConvertTo&lt;T&gt;() where T : IConvertible   // &lt;--- This method gets wrongfully marked as \"unused member\"\n            =&gt; (T)Convert.ChangeType(input, typeof(T));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that changing the call from the public method affects this behavior:\n```csharp\n// Alternative 1\n// When called with the true extension method signature, the private method is now correctly marked as \"used\".\npublic T[] SplitToArray&lt;T&gt;(char separator) where T : IConvertible\n    =&gt; [.. input.Split(separator).Select(x =&gt; x.ConvertTo&lt;T&gt;())];\n\n// Alternative 2\n// When called with the target as an input parameter, the private method is incorrectly marked as \"unused\" and a refactor is suggested to remove the lambda expression (to original example above).\npublic T[] SplitToArray&lt;T&gt;(char separator) where T : IConvertible\n    =&gt; [.. input.Split(separator).Select(x =&gt; ConvertTo&lt;T&gt;(x))]; \n```\n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Benjamin Copass on 12/11/2025, 01:27 AM: \n\n<p>Another example / use case:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">internal</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">PrivateExtensionPropertyTest</span>\n{\n    extension(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">object</span> o)\n    {\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">private</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">bool</span> Foo =&gt; o <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">is</span> <span class=\"hljs-literal\">null</span>; <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// faded out in Visual Studio (VS thinks it's an unused member)</span>\n    }\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">void</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">Test</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\"></span>)</span>\n    {\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">object</span> o = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">object</span>();\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">bool</span> b = o.Foo; <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Foo is actually used</span>\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 12/11/2025, 06:50 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

We were going to set a registry key that would prevent the admin install from updating the admin path.  This was [implemented](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/118092), but we had to back it out for .NET 10 due to MSI upgrade issues.\n\nNow, we think the best option to deal with admin installs may be to set environment variables that tell the admin installed muxer to redirect to the user install.  That's captured [here](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/350).  However, we haven't settled on that as a design and even if we did it would probably not be ready for us to use for an initial public preview of dotnetup to gather feedback.\n\nSo, our current plans for that preview are:\n\n- [ ] When there's an admin install on Windows, elevate and remove the Program Files dotnet path from the admin PATH value.  This will provide a good experience, but the next update of the admin version of dotnet will reset the PATH to the Program Files version.  Related: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51124\n- [ ] Add a dotnetup command to switch to the user local or to the admin install version of the SDK.  This can be used to fix the state after an admin install update.\n- [ ] Update the PowerShell profile to put the user dotnet install root on the PATH before the admin one.  This should by default on install as well as when the command is run to switch the default dotnet install root.\n- [ ] #52122\n- [ ] Handle path updates on Linux / Mac: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51582","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52121","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnetup: Set up installed dotnet install root as default\" (#52121)"},{"Id":"3716967263","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:18:12","Actor":"tmat","Number":"52120","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move definitions to Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Definitions","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52120","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Move definitions to Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Definitions\" (#52120)"},{"Id":"3716880703","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-10T21:44:25","Actor":"phil-scott-78","Number":"52119","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet watch ignores StaticWebAssetPath metadata on @(Watch) items, preventing custom static file hot reload","State":"open","Body":"I'm not finding a ton of documentation out there, but I've been trying to wire up dotnet watch to look at a separate folder than wwwroot that would trigger a browser refresh, but I'm stuck.\n\nIt seems the` StaticWebAssetPath` metadata on MSBuild `@(Watch)` items is silently ignored by dotnet watch. This prevents users from enabling static file hot reload (browser refresh without rebuild) for custom file types outside of wwwroot/.\n\n## Repro Steps\n\n 1. Create an ASP.NET Core 10 project\n 2. Add a markdown file outside wwwroot (e.g., Content/docs/readme.md)\n 3. Add the following to the .csproj:\n     ```xml\n     <ItemGroup>\n       <Watch Include=\"Content/**/*.md\" StaticWebAssetPath=\"%(Identity)\" />\n     </ItemGroup>\n     ```\n 4. Run dotnet watch\n 5. Edit the markdown file\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nThe file change should trigger a browser refresh via the `UpdateStaticFile` WebSocket message (same as files under wwwroot/), without triggering \"No C# changes to apply.\"\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\n```\n dotnet watch ⌚ File updated: .\\Content\\docs\\readme.md\n dotnet watch ⌚ No C# changes to apply.\n```\n\n The file is watched, but goes through the managed code change handler instead of the static file handler.\n\nMy understand is that the routing decision happens in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/BuiltInTools/Watch/HotReload/StaticFileHandler.cs, lines 22-26:\n\n```csharp\n if (file.StaticWebAssetPath is null)\n {\n     allFilesHandled = false;  // File passes through to managed code handler\n     continue;                  // Skip static file handling\n }\n```\n\n When StaticWebAssetPath is set:\n 1. Line 28: Logs \"Handling file change event for static content\"\n 2. Line 49: Adds file to browser refresh request list\n 3. Line 64: Calls `UpdateStaticAssetsAsync()` → sends WebSocket `UpdateStaticFile` message to browser\n 4. Line 68: Logs \"Hot reload of static assets succeeded\"\n\n When StaticWebAssetPath is null (current behavior):\n - File is skipped (allFilesHandled = false)\n - Falls through to `CompilationHandler.HandleManagedCodeChangesAsync()`\n - Results in \"No C# changes to apply.\"\n\n## Root Cause\n\n In https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/BuiltInTools/Watch/Build/EvaluationResult.cs, lines 120-127:\n```csharp\n var items = projectInstance.GetItems(ItemNames.Compile)\n     .Concat(projectInstance.GetItems(ItemNames.AdditionalFiles))\n     .Concat(projectInstance.GetItems(ItemNames.Watch));\n\n foreach (var item in items)\n {\n     AddFile(item.EvaluatedInclude, staticWebAssetPath: null);  // <-- BUG maybe?? Always null\n }\n```\n\n The `StaticWebAssetPath` metadata is always passed as null for `@(Watch)` items. Compare this to the `@(Content)` item handling (lines 129-144), which correctly reads and passes the metadata.\n\nMeanwhile, the MSBuild targets file https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/BuiltInTools/dotnet-watch/Watch/DotNetWatch.targets (lines 70-73) does set `StaticWebAssetPath` on `@(Watch)` items for content files:\n```xml\n <Watch Include=\"%(Content.FullPath)\"\n        Condition=\"...\"\n        StaticWebAssetPath=\"$(_DotNetWatchStaticWebAssetBasePath)$([System.String]::Copy('%(Identity)').Replace('\\','/'))\" />\n```\n\nThis metadata is populated but never read.\n\nI haven't tested this yet, but it looks like a tweak might be in EvaluationResult.cs, read the `StaticWebAssetPath` metadata from `@(Watch` items:\n\n```csharp\n var items = projectInstance.GetItems(ItemNames.Compile)\n     .Concat(projectInstance.GetItems(ItemNames.AdditionalFiles))\n     .Concat(projectInstance.GetItems(ItemNames.Watch));\n\n foreach (var item in items)\n {\n     var staticWebAssetPath = item.GetMetadataValue(MetadataNames.StaticWebAssetPath);\n     AddFile(item.EvaluatedInclude,\n             staticWebAssetPath: string.IsNullOrEmpty(staticWebAssetPath) ? null : staticWebAssetPath);\n }\n```\n\nThis would allow users to:\n\n 1. Enable static file hot reload for files outside wwwroot/\n 2. Mark any file type (markdown, json, xml, etc.) as a static asset\n 3. Use the existing `StaticWebAssetPath` metadata that's already documented in the targets file\n\nI think this is only on .NET 10. I believe some enhancements were made that prevent refresh when there are no code changes, but the scenario where we are watching stuff that is not in wwwroot, c#, CSS or wwwroot was missed. \n\n\n Environment\n\n - .NET SDK version: 10.0.101\n - OS: Windows","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet watch ignores StaticWebAssetPath metadata on @(Watch) items, preventing custom static file hot reload\" (#52119)"},{"Id":"3716472349","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-10T19:17:42","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"52118","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.3xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/msbuild","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:833bae60-eae0-4a99-8bf1-08dc11e0a92e)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild\n- **Subscription**: [833bae60-eae0-4a99-8bf1-08dc11e0a92e](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=833bae60-eae0-4a99-8bf1-08dc11e0a92e)\n- **Build**: [20251110.4](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=12749172) ([290131](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/4165/github:dotnet:msbuild/build/290131))\n- **Date Produced**: November 10, 2025 11:15:23 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: [1d044e3560b5c2b365548a212afc65011b6f6c8b](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/1d044e3560b5c2b365548a212afc65011b6f6c8b)\n- **Branch**: [vs17.10](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/tree/vs17.10)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Dependency Updates**:\n  - From [17.10.46-servicing-25466-04 to 17.10.49-servicing-25560-04][1]\n     - Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.msbuild\n     - Microsoft.Build.Localization\n  - From [17.10.46 to 17.10.49][1]\n     - Microsoft.Build\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/compare/aa888d3214...1d044e3560\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:833bae60-eae0-4a99-8bf1-08dc11e0a92e)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52118","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/8.0.3xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/msbuild\" (#52118)"},{"Id":"3716381963","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-10T18:48:17","Actor":"nagilson","Number":"52117","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nagilson nagilson cplt wrkfl","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52117","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Nagilson nagilson cplt wrkfl\" (#52117)"},{"Id":"3716381725","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-10T18:46:38","Actor":"tmat","Number":"52116","RawContent":null,"Title":"[dotnet-watch] Improve output when top-level code is updated","State":"open","Body":"Currently we only print `dotnet watch ⚠  Press \"Ctrl + R\" to restart.` in non-verbose mode.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[dotnet-watch] Improve output when top-level code is updated\" (#52116)"},{"Id":"3716338302","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-10T18:34:05","Actor":"nagilson","Number":"52115","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nagilson nagilson cplt wrkfl","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52115","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Nagilson nagilson cplt wrkfl\" (#52115)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3712286245","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-09T19:10:13","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"378","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET December 2025 Updates","State":"open","Body":"On December 09, 2025, we released .NET 10.0.1 updates.\n\n## Release Notes\n\n* [.NET December 2025 Update - .NET 10.0.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/10188)\n* [.NET 10.0.1 and .NET SDK 10.0.101](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/10.0/10.0.1/10.0.1.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/10.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November2025](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-december-2025-servicing-updates/).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET December 2025 Updates\" (#378)"},{"Id":"3612894501","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-11T15:54:32","Actor":"jongalloway","Number":"377","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 - Release","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/10157.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including terms and conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core GitHub organization. The main repos are located at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime and https://github.com/dotnet/aspnet/. The Announcements repo (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue.

The first sequence point for this method is at offset 36, so when its processing offset 1, there is no debug location set yet.  This is problem for llvm as if the function has a debug location, and this one does (it gets set on offset 36), then any call that could be in-lined must have a debug location and this is a problem for the call to initialise  the EH info enumerator.\r\n\r\nOne fix for this particular instance, and at least some of the others that are occurring, could be to not do the null check on the instance ldfld as this is an instance method, so unless this is a reflection call, then the instance should have been checked for null before calling the method.  \r\n\r\nAnother option to fix this problem in general could be to just take the first sequence point and apply that to call to `InitFromEhInfo`.   This is what I've done in the prolog if a call to a class constructor occurs. Would that be the right thing to do?

When the design-time build of the main project runs (to generate `*.g.i.cs` files and include them in the build), I get the following error in Tool Output in VSMac:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject \"/Volumes/Sources/WordPerfectViewer/src/WordPerfectViewer.Presentation/WordPerfectViewer.Presentation.csproj\" (Compile target(s)):\r\n\r\nTarget ResolvePackageAssets:\r\n    /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/5.0.100-preview.8.20417.9/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets(241,5): error NETSDK1005: Assets file '/Volumes/Sources/WordPerfectViewer/obj/WordPerfectViewer.Presentation/project.assets.json' doesn't have a target for 'net5.0-windows7.0'.

The main project restores correctly, as do the generated `wpftmp` projects used for some reason. I do not know what is going on here, but as a result I am getting lots of spurious symbol-undefined errors for `x:Name` variables and `InitializeComponent()`. I decided to file the repro here instead of in the WPF repo, because at least here I'd get some eyes on this issue; that repo is effectively dead. No one from Microsoft manages it any more.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present.

It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28073","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[.NET Core 3.1] Don't rely on the built-in interface marshaller during COM activation.\" (#28073)"},{"Id":"670175635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T23:15:55","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

The result is a random failure typically during XAML load. The managed definition of [`IManagedActivationFactory`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/68ec8a211852cc9cf662d19bac251f364719702f/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/WindowsRuntime/ManagedActivationFactory.cs#L10-L16) has been pruned of its function and thus when a call is made to a class implementing that interface, random memory is executed since there is no entry in the vtable.\r\n\r\nThe scenario involving this code was [removed in .NET 5.0](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37672) so there is no need to bring the work forward.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nUsers will be unable to use XAML Islands or WinUI with bindings in .NET 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no work around. The Linker removed the function definition and single implementation in question - they no longer exist in the assembly to call.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis is probably a regression, but I have not identified the exact location where the break was introduced.\r\n\r\nConfirmed the method is missing and broken in [3.0.1](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/Sdk/release/3.0.1xx/dotnet-sdk-latest-win-x64.exe), but the method is present in 2.2.7.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidated a patched version of `System.Private.CoreLib` against a XAML Island scenario from https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Islands-Samples.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n/cc @jeffschwMSFT @jkotas @jkoritzinsky

Sends on a WebSocket can't run concurrently, and there's a lock that protects access to shared resources, including a pooled buffer.  The code that ends a send operation returns the buffer to the pool and releases the lock, but it does so in the opposite (wrong) order.  As such, a second concurrent send could end up trying to use the buffer concurrently with the first send operation releasing it.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported as a sporadic ArgumentException that escapes from within the WebSocket implementation (from valid usage).  But in theory it could result in data corruption throughout the process, with a buffer being returned to the pool while it's still in use.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow.

That is, if a line of code is too long, it automatically gets broken up into multiple lines. I often find myself writing very long lines of code (up to 200 columns).

Create a solution with an `.editorconfig` file and a project configured to use at least one Roslyn analyzer package that contains bulk configurable rule(s).\r\n2. Add a bulk configuration for error severity to `.editorconfig` that should change the effective severity of at least one rule (e.g.: `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.severity = error` or `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-<some category>.severity = error`).\r\n3.  Save the `.editorconfig` file.\r\n4.  Examine a rule (e.g.: CA1820) whose severity should have been adjusted under the `Dependencies\\Analyzers` node of the project in the Visual Studio solution explorer.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nThe rule icon should reflect the severity applied via bulk configuration, as should the \"Effective severity\" item in the diagnostic properties sheet, as it is when a rule is configured using a rule-specific `.editorconfig` entry (e.g.: `dotnet_diagnostic.CA1820.severity = error`).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6350017/91342868-a7dd2a00-e7a9-11ea-8e5c-c95659f02b43.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nNeither the rule icon nor the effective severity property display change to reflect the severity applied via bulk configuration.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6350017/91342954-cc390680-e7a9-11ea-9e75-9c85c80d4dc6.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes**:\r\nThis issue seems to hint that the logic used to determine effective severity is not fully shared between the execution engine and the UI.  While the current UI behaviour is inconvenient, any mismatches between applied and displayed severity will potentially become much more problematic when/if the `.editorconfig` editor UI (#40365) becomes available.  If the current discrepancy is indeed the result of a lack of centralized logic for determining effective severity, might it make sense to invest in centralizing the logic that so users can feel confident in the information provided to them by the eventual editor?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47160","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Severity applied via bulk configuration

A fix would be nice]\r\nIf I write:\n\n```\nIf Foo() Then Bar\n```\nand Foo is not already know, then the IDE makes a proposal to create an new Foo by creating a method called Foo. That's great. It also knows, that it must be a function. Good. But when it's created, it has the wrong return type. The result of the automatically created Foo is:\n\n```\nPrivate Function Foo() As Object\n\tThrow New NotImplementedException()\nEnd Function\n```\nAnd then the IDE complains about the invalid data type in the If-statement. The right code would be:\n\n```\nPrivate Function Foo() As Boolean\n\tThrow New NotImplementedException()\nEnd Function\n\n```\nI just wonder why the IDE creates a method which consequently annoys the compiler.

I'm hoping this could be solved with some trick/workaround on the UWP side, as I'd really, really like not to be forced to alter the API surface on the .NET Standard side for a specific issue with the .NET Native compiler.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! 😊","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[.NET Native] ILT0005 build error with ref T returning delegate\" (#8273)"},{"Id":"682498755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T07:43:54","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8272","RawContent":null,"Title":"Arm64","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8272","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Arm64\" (#8272)"},{"Id":"682460020","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T06:36:00","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support for ARM64 on UNIX like systems compiler and runtime","State":"open","Body":"Implements most of the missing parts for ARM64 on UNIX like hosts.\r\n* Change section for native signature layout from read only to data for non Windows systems to avoid linker issues with absolute relocations between sections\r\n* Store CFI data for ARM64 non Windows builds\r\n* Add special ARM64 relocation types were needed\r\n* Implements functions to handle 28 bit offsets in ARM64 opcodes\r\n* Implements ARM64 instruction encoding\r\n* Implements helper nodes ARM64 code generators\r\n* Implements ARM64 intrinsic supports by following the XArch pattern\r\n* Implements runtime query and check of required intrinsics\r\n* Use special name for AssignRef helper functions as RyuJit uses a custom calling convention for these on ARM64 \r\n* Change relocation type for exception type in catch handler to avoid an assert in LLVM.

I'm not sure how exactly it's allowing that lookup at runtime, through reflection is the obvious way from user land, but I imagine Mono is doing something better.  Could the same be done for CoreRT without reflection?  Mono is returning mono specific types, e.g. `MonoMethod*` but might be better to make those just opaque `IntPtr`s as in java script land they are just `number` type anyway.

When the design-time build of the main project runs (to generate `*.g.i.cs` files and include them in the build), I get the following error in Tool Output in VSMac:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject \"/Volumes/Sources/WordPerfectViewer/src/WordPerfectViewer.Presentation/WordPerfectViewer.Presentation.csproj\" (Compile target(s)):\r\n\r\nTarget ResolvePackageAssets:\r\n    /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/5.0.100-preview.8.20417.9/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets(241,5): error NETSDK1005: Assets file '/Volumes/Sources/WordPerfectViewer/obj/WordPerfectViewer.Presentation/project.assets.json' doesn't have a target for 'net5.0-windows7.0'.

The main project restores correctly, as do the generated `wpftmp` projects used for some reason. I do not know what is going on here, but as a result I am getting lots of spurious symbol-undefined errors for `x:Name` variables and `InitializeComponent()`. I decided to file the repro here instead of in the WPF repo, because at least here I'd get some eyes on this issue; that repo is effectively dead. No one from Microsoft manages it any more.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

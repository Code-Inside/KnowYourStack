The modified code was identical to the code in 5.0.\r\n\r\nThe customer that reported the issue for 3.1 verified this code fix with a private DLL sent to them, and verified the exception is now being thrown as expected:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42360#issuecomment-694545520\r\n\r\nThe customer also verified the behavior in 5.0 and confirmed that their issue is gone in that version, which justifies the backport: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42360#issuecomment-693791617\r\n"},{"Id":"13603700907","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-22T16:45:21","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42990","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr\" (#42990) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr\r\n- **Subscription**: dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5\r\n- **Build**: 20200919.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/19/2020 8:23 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 3fbe13469a10dca70e50f7cb8507e348b9095563\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk.IL**: [from 3.1.9-servicing.20466.1 to 3.1.9-servicing.20469.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm**: [from 3.1.9-servicing.20466.1 to 3.1.9-servicing.20469.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.CoreCLR**: [from 3.1.9-servicing.20466.1 to 3.1.9-servicing.20469.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/compare/dd56afa...3fbe134\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"13635820134","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-25T04:01:59","Actor":"msftbot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47710","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Ensure that warnaserror works identically for warnings configured in …\" (#47710) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"…ruleset and global config\r\n\r\n1.

FileStream.Dispose silently fails on Dispose when disk has run out of space","State":"closed","Body":"Backporting PR https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/38742\r\n\r\nThe test goes into corefx: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42988\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42360\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nA customer hit this issue in 3.1 when trying to deploy to AzureStorage: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42360\r\n\r\nOn Unix, when the disk runs out of space before a `FileStream` is disposed and the buffer is flushed to disk, `Dispose` silently succeeds, causing files to be corrupted and preventing the user from taking corrective action.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, we throw at the expected moment, allowing the user to react appropriately.\r\n\r\nThe suggested fix is to save any error thrown when the `SafeFileHandle.ReleaseHandle` method is called when the handle is disposed, then check that saved error in `FileStream.Dispose`, and throw an exception if there was an error.\r\n\r\nThe customer who reported this issue stated they will not be able to migrate to 5.0 soon.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* Manually verified using the provided manual test introduced in the corefx change.\r\n* The customer verified the behavior in 5.0 and confirmed that their issue is gone in that version, which justifies the backport (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42360#issuecomment-693791617)\r\n* The customer that reported the issue for 3.1 verified this code fix with a private DLL sent to them, and verified the

This happened accidentally as part of a performance fix in 3.x.  That fix tried to ensure a seekable stream and would copy the backing stream contents when doing so.  This was unnecessary work (and an unnecessary copy) since saving the image only requires writing and not reading nor seeking.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomer encounters `NotSupportedException` when trying to save an image when they did not before.  This is blocking service update to 3.1 for the customer as well as preventing their upstack consumers of this service from updating.\r\nWorkaround would involve saving to a `MemoryStream` then copying to the final stream, which is undesirable.  This significantly increases CPU and memory usage to a in a commonly used component low in the stack.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from 2.1: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/commit/dee434428ee392302ff2050bbee304c9fce68b2f\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests added to cover this scenario.

There is no workaround and if running long enough, .NET will consume all available memory and crash. The `SecTrustRef` is internal structure and holds additional objects - like URL of OCSP or CRL responder so leaked memory is bigger than small. \r\n\r\n## Customer  Impact \r\nWe have worked with a major customer who has been hitting this leak in an app that they intend to widely deploy within their organization (10K”s of deployments). They are encountering this leak and it is blocking their deployment. They have attempted to work around it by restarting the app when their memory consumption reaches a threshold but this workaround is not sustainable for them at scale so they are seeking a fix backported to 3.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nno.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nthe fix was verified with Apple's development tools e.g. `leaks` utility\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nlow.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

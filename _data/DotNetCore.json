The second commit contains everything new.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47478\r\nand https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/43851\r\n\r\nReasons for all the changes:\r\n1.  Previously, the [embedded language completion provider attempted](http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Features/Completion/Providers/AbstractEmbeddedLanguageCompletionProvider.cs,50) to roundtrip Document -> SourceText -> Document.  This doesn't work for closed files (razor files are always closed) because there is no workspace registration.  The solution here is to instead provide a completion API that does not need to roundtrip these fields.  This is the new ShouldTriggerCompletion APIs with project / language services parameters.\r\n2.  The above still did not resolve the issues with embedded language completion in LSP / razor.  The second issue was missing commit characters from the [Initialize](http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.Protocol/Handler/Initialize/InitializeHandler.cs,40) response.  This is because the embeddedlanguage completion providers are not exported as regular completion providers and so did not have trigger characters.  Instead there was [one overall provider](http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Features/Completion/Providers/AbstractEmbeddedLanguageCompletionProvider.cs,48) that called into the each embedded language provider upon request.  There was an extremely confusing flow where the embedded language service created the completion providers, then the AbstractEmbeddedLanguageCompletionProvider access the project language services to get the embedded language services to get back to the completion providers.\r\n\r\nThere was no way to access the specific completion provider (e.g. DateAndTimeCompletionProvidder) without having access to an instance of the project's language services.  But for LSP we need to send the trigger characters upfront on Initialize where we do not have access to the project language services.  To resolve this, I transformed the embedded language completion providers to be actual mef exported completion providers (that specify trigger characters).  When triggered for completion they then grab the right embedded language service to provide results.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot here, so feel free to ping me with questions\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[{"Id":"13547589942","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-17T04:33:04","Actor":"jkotas","Repository":"dotnet/corert","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8336","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"ARM64: Add more cfi data\" (#8336) at dotnet/corert","RelatedBody":"While the assembler helpers follow the ARM64 ABI and build a correct chain of frame information the debugger still have trouble to show a correct call stack when it include one of these assembler functions.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present.

The test updates did not get ported to this PR but can be if those changes are desired. The minimum updates to tests were applied here to enable build and run of existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThe risk of this change has two facets. It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28073","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[.NET Core 3.1] Don't rely on the built-in interface marshaller during COM activation.\" (#28073)"},{"Id":"670175635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T23:15:55","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

Specify the process-control plug and manually connect it before running the app\r\n  - Require the classic confinement instead and specify it when installing the app\r\n- The workarounds may also cause some difficulty, especially longer-term, for .NET Core apps to be added to the public snap store due to the extra control the process would require.\r\n  - It is possible to specify to auto-connect the process-control plug using store processes, but it requires review and justification, and the purpose of working around this issue may be difficult to justify longer-term\r\n  - Apps that use the classic confinement run without any sandboxing, and may not be allowed in the public snap store for the purpose of working around this issue\r\n  - See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1634#issuecomment-667332468 for more information\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested a small app under Snap's strict confinement\r\n- PAL, coreclr, and libraries tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- Instead of the creating thread changing the affinity of the created thread, the created thread changes its own affinity after starting, the difference is mostly invisible\r\n- Where appropriate, used a fallback to use the pthread implementation for setting the affinity when sched_setaffinity is not available, so in the theoretical possibility of a different pthread implementation for setting the affinity, there would be no change from before","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28071","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Change new thread's affinity after thread starts, from the same thread, as a workaround for Snap\" (#28071)"},{"Id":"668934448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-30T17:04:31","Actor":"silvioguiso","Number":"28069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Decodes bitstream to string","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Decodes bitstream to string\" (#28069)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CLI-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"702390737","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T07:16:08","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"13561","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1.4xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/sdk","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n- **Subscription**: 74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae\r\n- **Build**: 20200915.25\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/16/2020 1:56 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 7c8ec1ed801d80116a87da8f6f874f0cc3f4b18e\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1.4xx\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

If no, what is the benefit of the new feature?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1748","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Is it legal to decompile .NET libraries?\" (#1748)"},{"Id":"595131445","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T13:46:58","Actor":"Nekuskus","Number":"1754","RawContent":null,"Title":"System.TypeInitializationException","State":"open","Body":"I keep getting `System.TypeInitializationException: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Can't find file or assembly 'System.Private.CoreLib, Version=4.0.0.0', Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e` exception after moving my app from .NET Core to .NET Framework 4.7.2.

There is no workaround and if running long enough, .NET will consume all available memory and crash. The `SecTrustRef` is internal structure and holds additional objects - like URL of OCSP or CRL responder so leaked memory is bigger than small. \r\n\r\n## Customer  Impact \r\nWe have worked with a major customer who has been hitting this leak in an app that they intend to widely deploy within their organization (10K”s of deployments).

The second commit contains everything new.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47478\r\nResolves https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/43851\r\n\r\nReasons for all the changes:\r\n1.  Previously, the [embedded language completion provider attempted](http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Features/Completion/Providers/AbstractEmbeddedLanguageCompletionProvider.cs,50) to roundtrip Document -> SourceText -> Document.  This doesn't work for closed files (razor files are always closed) because there is no workspace registration.  The solution here is to instead provide a completion API that does not need to roundtrip these fields.  This is the new ShouldTriggerCompletion APIs with project / language services parameters.\r\n2.  The above still did not resolve the issues with embedded language completion in LSP / razor.  The second issue was missing commit characters from the [Initialize](http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.Protocol/Handler/Initialize/InitializeHandler.cs,40) response.  This is because the embeddedlanguage completion providers are not exported as regular completion providers and so did not have trigger characters.  Instead there was [one overall provider](http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Features/Completion/Providers/AbstractEmbeddedLanguageCompletionProvider.cs,48) that called into the each embedded language provider upon request.  There was an extremely confusing flow where the embedded language service created the completion providers, then the AbstractEmbeddedLanguageCompletionProvider access the project language services to get the embedded language services to get back to the completion providers.\r\n\r\nThere was no way to access the specific completion provider (e.g. DateAndTimeCompletionProvidder) without having access to an instance of the project's language services.  But for LSP we need to send the trigger characters upfront on Initialize where we do not have access to the project language services.  To resolve this, I transformed the embedded language completion providers to be actual mef exported completion providers (that specify trigger characters).  When triggered for completion they then grab the right embedded language service to provide results.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot here, so feel free to ping me with questions\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47776","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Enable commit characters in LSP\" (#47776)"},{"Id":"703235367","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-17T03:31:12","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"47775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Out variable can be used when not definitely assigned","State":"closed","Body":"@AlekseyTs Is this expected?\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class C \r\n{\r\n    public int Property => true ?

This is required because in the default open file analysis mode, we only run analyzers on open files, and do not run compilation end actions. Hence, the compilation end analyzers are essentially build-only analyzers - these are executed when user invokes an explicit build inside VS, but not during live analysis. Knowing if a diagnostic ID/analyzer is a compilation end analyzer is required to correctly de-dupe build and live diagnostics in error list.\r\n\r\n# Issues with current approach to determine IsCompilationEndAnalyzer\r\n\r\n1. We currently use a very error prone and fragile approach to determine if an analyzer is a compilation end analyzer: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/87f4c9dfc033d81d162249ab4831367f9796bb69/src/Workspaces/Core/Portable/Diagnostics/DiagnosticAnalyzerInfoCache_CompilationEnd.cs#L41-L65\r\n2. This approach needs us to fetch compilation for the project. This was found to be very expensive and primary bottleneck in updating the error list after a build (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47689), as we need to de-dupe build and live diagnostics and categorize build-only diagnostics. Given we have very few compilation end analyzers, it is unfortunate that we are taking such a big performance hit for this determining logic.\r\n\r\n# Alternate approaches\r\n\r\nWe need to identify a more correct, declarative way to identify compilation end diagnostics.  The only way this can be done is if there is a way that analyzer authors can mark their DiagnosticDescriptors as compilation end ones. This will remove all the reliability and performance issues with the current approach.\r\n\r\nWe have few possible ways to address this. However, we cannot introduce any breaking diagnostic analyzer API changes here.\r\n1. New API: Add a new DiagnosticDescriptor ctor overload that takes an additional boolean parameter, say `bool isCompilationEnd`, and expose a corresponding boolean property off DiagnosticDescriptor\r\n2. Custom tag: Require analyzer authors to specify a special custom tag string to identify compilation end descriptors.\r\n\r\n(1) looks to be the more cleaner approach but has following big drawbacks:\r\n   1. Forces analyzer authors to build with a newer Microsoft.CodeAnalysis package, which prevents the package from working against all the previous VS/compiler versions. This is not acceptable approach for large number of analyzer authors - especiall @sharwell has been against such force upgrades in the past.\r\n   2. There is no use case of this flag/property in command line build case, it will only be used for IDE scenarios, so I find it less convincing that needs a new analyzer API.\r\n\r\n(2) is a very simple solution, requiring no new API to be added by us and analyzer authors can stay on existing Microsoft.CodeAnalysis package.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Any change here would introduce a breaking change for existing analyzer packages with compilation end analyzers. I think that is acceptable given:\r\n1. We have very few compilation end analyzers today\r\n2. Diagnostics reported from compilation end analyzers do not support code fixes, again for performance reasons\r\n3. There is a very simple fix from analyzer author side to fix this break and release an updated package\r\n4. We can write a meta-analayzer that flags analyzers registering compilation end actions, but not passing this new custom tag/bool parameter.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47754","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Functional and Performance issues in detecting compilation end analyzers in IDE\" (#47754)"},{"Id":"703028662","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T19:10:08","Actor":"DasOhmoff","Number":"47759","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding analyzer to analyze its own project in which it is created?","State":"open","Body":"Hello, thank you for your help.\r\n\r\nImagine the following scenario: I create a project called \"AnalyzerProject\" in which a analyzer gets defined.\r\nIs it possible to use this very same analyzer to analyze the very same project?\r\nSo that this analyzer that gets build analyzes the project \"AnalyzerProject\"?\r\n\r\nIf so, how can I make this happen?\r\nI have three projects in my solution, a analyzer project (net standard 2.0), a code fixes project (net standard 2.0), a package project (which combines both, and is also net standard 2.0), and a vsix project (so that I can test the analyzer by starting another visual studio instance.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

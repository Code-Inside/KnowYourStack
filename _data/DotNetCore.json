loop","State":"open","Body":"When return address hijacking occurs when the target thread is running\r\nin the stack probing loop in a method with large frame, the unwinder cannot\r\nunwind to the caller frame correctly. That results in a wrong stack slot\r\nbeing patched by the modified return address, leading to corruption of\r\nlocals of the method being executed.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the problem by not attempting to hijack a method that's\r\nrunning in prolog.\r\n\r\nThis change is not a port, as the .NET 5.0 uses a different method to do stack \r\nprobing. That method would require a too large change to be ported though, \r\nso this is a targeted fix.\r\n\r\n# Customer impact\r\nCustomer (RavenDB) database servers processing customer data are crashing on a regular basis (few times a week) with SIGSEGV.\r\nThere is no workaround for the problem.\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42885 for more details.\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nCustomer testing a custom libcoreclr.so based on 3.1.8 containing this fix. They were testing the change on their production servers for about a month. The intermittent crashes they were seeing on a regular basis have disappeared and their systems were working flawlessly.\r\n\r\n# Risk\r\nLow, the change just prevents return address hijacking to happen in prolog of methods with large frames.

This caused a race-condition on the read/write on this list, causing a crash. The problem does not exist in the 5.0 fix, only for the 3.1 backport. \r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMedium/High. When hit with this issue, a customer may experience a crash. A customer may run into this issue when they turn on the runtime counters (System.Runtime) or any other set of counter providers, and then modify the list of counters while a counter callback is happening by either creating or disposing instances of EventCounters. For customers that don't consume/create their own EventCounters, this shouldn't be a problem. For those who do, it's pretty easy to hit with the likelihood increasing the shorter they set the counter polling interval.\r\n\r\n## Regression \r\n\r\nYes. From 3.1.8 -> 3.1.9 servicing release. \r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n\r\nWe do not have a local repro of this failure, but we tested the fix by providing a custom build of the runtime with this fix to the  internal partner test that initially reported this problem. They ran it in production that hit this issue and reported that this addresses the issue.\r\n\r\n## Risk \r\n\r\nThe root cause/fix is well-understood and the fix was verified through partner testing - I would say it is relatively low.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28112","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix a potential race in iterating counters\" (#28112)"},{"Id":"709001291","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-16T16:15:41","Actor":"mlindstr","Number":"28104","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix ilasm managed resource lookup on Linux.","State":"closed","Body":"ILAsm did not properly find managed resources if they were not in the\r\nworking directory of ILAsm itself.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"705166145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-20T19:05:41","Actor":"Korporal","Number":"1775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confusing behavior when using AssemblyInfo.cs ","State":"open","Body":"I'm completely perplexed.\r\n\r\nI created a .Net Standard 2.0 library project.\r\n\r\nI explicity added an AssemblyInfo.cs file, we need this because we use this utility to \"stamp\" our assemblies when we build them:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ygoe/NetRevisionTool\r\n\r\nThat utility is run as a pre/post build event and temporarily replaces placeholders in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute with runtime values (like repo folder name, commit ID, branch etc etc).\r\n\r\nThe completed assembly then has this info \"burned\" into it as we go forward.\r\n\r\n.Net Standard is not working with this.\r\n\r\n1.

This happened accidentally as part of a performance fix in 3.x.  That fix tried to ensure a seekable stream and would copy the backing stream contents when doing so.  This was unnecessary work (and an unnecessary copy) since saving the image only requires writing and not reading nor seeking.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomer encounters `NotSupportedException` when trying to save an image when they did not before.  This is blocking service update to 3.1 for the customer as well as preventing their upstack consumers of this service from updating.\r\nWorkaround would involve saving to a `MemoryStream` then copying to the final stream, which is undesirable.

This is a shortcut for deleting things faster than going one character at a time.  In a sentence, this would be the individual words of the sentence.  For example, if done with the caret starting at the beginning of this paragraph, the first CTRL+DEL would delete \"When\", the second would delete \"the\", and so on.\n\nIn Visual Studio there are times when this functionality doesn't work properly and it's killing my productivity.  Instead of leaving the caret where it is and deleting the next string of characters located after it, the IDE jumps the caret to the beginning of the line.  CTRL+DEL should **never** move the caret on the user.  It should only delete content located after it.\n\nI've tracked the issue down to a 100% reliable repro, which seems to occur when VS \"pretends\" to insert whitespace before the caret, but hasn't actually done so yet (as far as things exist on disk).\n\nREPRO\n1. Paste the following C# code into a class (ensure the indentation is preserved):\n```\n        void Foo()\n        {\n        }\n        private void Bar()\n        {\n        }\n```\n2. Place the caret after the closing curly brace for the \"Foo\" method (i.e. after '}').\n3. Press enter to insert a new line.  Observe that the caret will now be indented, located immediately under the '}'.  However, note that the whitespace located before the caret on that line is currently \"virtual\".  While displayed to the user, it doesn't actually exist yet (that won't happen until something is typed).\n4. Now press CTRL+DELETE **twice**.  The goal of the first press is to delete the blank line and bring the `private void Bar()` line up to the caret.  The goal of the second press is to delete the `private` keyword.\n\nInstead of that working as expected, with the caret remaining in place at all times, the following happens after the first press:\n```\n        void Foo()\n        {\n        }\nprivate void Bar()\n        {\n        }\n```\nThe caret jumps to the beginning of the line.\n\nThis is incredibly annoying and regressed at some point in time (it used to work properly in an older version of VS)\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 12/27/2020, 06:42 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

A fix would be nice]\r\nHi,\n\nI get a yellow warning bar VS stating something has gone wrong and I should restart it almost every time I open/work on a particular solution. I *assume* this problem might be because I have multiple suppressions for the same code analysis rule, but if that is the case;\n\n1. I do not think it should crash like this\n2. The suppress would have been added via the right-click -> suppress menu in the error list window, so it shouldn't have added a duplicate\n3. This is a large legacy code bases with 1000's of suppressions from prior to the point where we enabled code analysis and few more since as new rules have been added and we've elected not to spend time refactoring old code but want to keep the rule on for new code. As such, tracking down duplicate suppressions like this to fix the cause is very difficult.\n\nCould the rule be updated to cope with this situation and not crash/cause an error in the first place?\n\nStreamJsonRpc.RemoteInvocationException: An item with the same key has already been added.\n   at StreamJsonRpc.JsonRpc. <InvokeCoreAsync>d__133`1.MoveNext()\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n   at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Remote.RemoteEndPoint. <InvokeAsync>d__22`1.MoveNext()\nRPC server exception:\nSystem.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added.\n      at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentException(ExceptionResource resource)\n      at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.Insert(TKey key, TValue value, Boolean add)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.RemoveUnnecessarySuppressions.AbstractRemoveUnnecessaryInlineSuppressionsDiagnosticAnalyzer. <ProcessSuppressMessageAttributesAsync>d__25.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.RemoveUnnecessarySuppressions.AbstractRemoveUnnecessaryInlineSuppressionsDiagnosticAnalyzer. <AnalyzeAsync>d__16.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Diagnostics.Extensions.<>c__DisplayClass13_0. <<GetPragmaSuppressionAnalyzerDiagnosticsAsync>g__AnalyzeDocumentAsync|0>d.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Diagnostics.Extensions. <GetPragmaSuppressionAnalyzerDiagnosticsAsync>d__13.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Diagnostics.Extensions. <GetAnalysisResultAsync>d__11.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Remote.Diagnostics.DiagnosticComputer. <AnalyzeAsync>d__9.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Remote.Diagnostics.DiagnosticComputer. <GetDiagnosticsAsync>d__8.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Remote.CodeAnalysisService.<>c__DisplayClass15_0. <<CalculateDiagnosticsAsync>b__0>d.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\n      at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Remote.ServiceBase. <RunServiceAsync>d__17.MoveNext()\n   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n      at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\n      at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Telemetry.WindowsErrorReporting.WatsonReport.GetClrWatsonExceptionInfo(Exception exceptionObject)\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 1/14/2021, 00:33 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

However, if I tell VS to apply the suggestion, it applies it to the full array reference, rather than just the Enum value in the index.\nThat is, I get\n`if ((int)myArray[myEnumValue] == 1) { _some code here_ }.`\nrather than\n`if (myArray[(int)myEnumValue] == 1) { _some code here_ }.`\nas expected. This leads to the issue still being present, with the same suggestion still there. I can apply the suggestion repeatedly, potentially ending up with\n`if ((int)(int)(int)(int)myArray[myEnumValue] == 1) { _some code here_ }.`\nor however far I want to carry it. Naturally, this is not a breaking issue, and not one that will come up a lot, but in my style, I find it slightly easier and less error-prone to go ahead and type the simpler code and then go back and let IntelliSense put everything where it goes, so a minor correction like this would still be useful.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Tom S on 12/22/2020, 07:22 AM: \n\n<p>On further investigation, it looks like sometimes rather than generating the incorrect cast, it will simply refuse to do anything. Selecting the suggestion will have no effect, and it will stay there. Selecting “Preview changes” will bring up the window with no changes listed. Either way, this still seems to be incorrect behavior.</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 12/22/2020, 05:20 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

This option uses information provided by the used .NET Core SDK to determine what patch version should be used. (e.g. for .NET Core SDK 3.1.404 the information is stored here: C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.404\\Microsoft.NETCoreSdk.BundledVersions.props) \r\nThis means that different .NET Core SDKs will use different patch versions when publishing an app.\r\n\r\nSince the .NET Core SDKs are installed in-place since 3.1 and usually updated by Visual Studio or recently also by [Microsoft Update](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-updates-coming-to-microsoft-update/#in-place-install-for-monthly-servicing-updates), it is hard to coordinate that all machines have always the same .NET Core SDK installed at a given time. This leads to the problem that different machines might produce different output when publishing.\r\n\r\n**Scenario**\r\n\r\nOur build-agents produce nightly installers for the current development stage, so it is possible that a new build could use older runtime DLLs, when the SDK is not yet updated, which would result in a DLL-version-downgrade, which is usually a problem for installers.\r\n\r\n**Workarounds**\r\n\r\nWe could pin a specific .NET Core SDK using the `global.json` by disabling the roll-forward policy.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders. But we plan to make this experience better in future releases.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at [dotnet/core #4032](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4032).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/146","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1\" (#146)"},{"Id":"536031264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-10T22:29:30","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"145","RawContent":null,"Title":"December 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on December 2019.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system)\r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project)\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu)\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness)\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker)\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools)\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf)\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**. When you go to the original repository, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Update local repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210184-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-93a8-2b13dbbf74c8.png)\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/6825."},{"Id":"14795404438","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-01-12T18:30:01","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/171","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"January 2021 .NET Updates\" (#171) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"The following .NET updates were released in January 2020.

This caused a race-condition on the read/write on this list, causing a crash. The problem does not exist in the 5.0 fix, only for the 3.1 backport. \r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMedium/High. When hit with this issue, a customer may experience a crash. A customer may run into this issue when they turn on the runtime counters (System.Runtime) or any other set of counter providers, and then modify the list of counters while a counter callback is happening by either creating or disposing instances of EventCounters. For customers that don't consume/create their own EventCounters, this shouldn't be a problem. For those who do, it's pretty easy to hit with the likelihood increasing the shorter they set the counter polling interval.\r\n\r\n## Regression \r\n\r\nYes. From 3.1.8 -> 3.1.9 servicing release. \r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n\r\nWe do not have a local repro of this failure, but we tested the fix by providing a custom build of the runtime with this fix to the  internal partner test that initially reported this problem. They ran it in production that hit this issue and reported that this addresses the issue.\r\n\r\n## Risk \r\n\r\nThe root cause/fix is well-understood and the fix was verified through partner testing - I would say it is relatively low.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28112","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix a potential race in iterating counters\" (#28112)"},{"Id":"709001291","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-16T16:15:41","Actor":"mlindstr","Number":"28104","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix ilasm managed resource lookup on Linux.","State":"closed","Body":"ILAsm did not properly find managed resources if they were not in the\r\nworking directory of ILAsm itself.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

This happened accidentally as part of a performance fix in 3.x.  That fix tried to ensure a seekable stream and would copy the backing stream contents when doing so.  This was unnecessary work (and an unnecessary copy) since saving the image only requires writing and not reading nor seeking.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomer encounters `NotSupportedException` when trying to save an image when they did not before.  This is blocking service update to 3.1 for the customer as well as preventing their upstack consumers of this service from updating.\r\nWorkaround would involve saving to a `MemoryStream` then copying to the final stream, which is undesirable.  This significantly increases CPU and memory usage to a in a commonly used component low in the stack.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from 2.1: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/commit/dee434428ee392302ff2050bbee304c9fce68b2f\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests added to cover this scenario.

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system)\r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project)\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu)\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness)\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker)\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools)\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf)\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot)\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**. When you go to the original repository, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Update local repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210184-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-93a8-2b13dbbf74c8.png)\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please use https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/6825.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/172","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The dotnet org will rename all default branches to main\" (#172)"},{"Id":"784480708","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-12T18:30:01","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"171","RawContent":null,"Title":"January 2021 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released in January 2020.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1356765596449452039","CreatedAt":"2021-02-03T00:45:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Listen to @ChristosMatskas talk about Microsofity Identiy and security in the cloud on The 6 Figure Developer podca… https://t.co/V7HeaMdSWb","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":9,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1356715018759331841","CreatedAt":"2021-02-02T21:24:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"How do you migrate the millions of #ASPNET Web Forms applications to .NET Core? \n\nIn this session replay from… https://t.co/7JHKXNUw71","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":41,"FavoriteCount":7,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1356679325320314880","CreatedAt":"2021-02-02T19:02:11+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"We're now live doing API reviews. https://t.co/lXY8t8X5z6","Source":"<a href=\"https://restream.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restream.io</a>","RetweetCount":16,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1356673744744374285","CreatedAt":"2021-02-02T18:40:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"...looking for options?

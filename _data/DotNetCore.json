We have a process to evaluate the value and shape of new APIs. There is an overview of our process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/contributing/API%20Review%20Process.md). This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\r\nFirst, please describe the purpose and value of the new API here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\nWhat we would like is that if any analyzers where run those would be reported to the rules field:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"results\": [],\r\n\"rules\": {\r\n  \"CA5351\": {\r\n    \"id\": \"CA5351\",\r\n    \"shortDescription\": \"Do Not Use Broken Cryptographic Algorithms\",\r\n    \"fullDescription\": \"An attack making it computationally.....\",\r\n    \"defaultLevel\": \"warning\",\r\n    \"helpUri\": \"https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca5351\",\r\n    \"properties\": {\r\n      \"category\": \"Security\",\r\n      \"isEnabledByDefault\": true,\r\n      \"tags\": [\r\n        \"Telemetry\",\r\n        \"EnabledRuleInAggressiveMode\"\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"configuration\":{\r\n        \"enabled\": true,\r\n        \"defaultLevel\": \"warning\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere are 2 main changes\r\n- **Exporting rules:** Rules will now be reported regardless of whether or not an issue was found. It's not necessary to find a diagnostic for `CA5351` in order for the rule to be present in the SARIF file.\r\n- The `rule` object gets a new property, respecting the SARIF format, that shows us what's the default level of the rule (warning, error) and if its enabled.\r\n\r\n### Necessary changes\r\nUnder `CommonCompiler.cs` we will have to pass the information about the analyzers to the error logger. Of course the SARIF logger will have to change to include those rules.\r\n\r\nMore specifically the changes could be under:\r\n### CommonCompiler.cs\r\n``` cs\r\nprivate int RunCore(TextWriter consoleOutput, ErrorLogger? errorLogger, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n{\r\n . .\r\n . .\r\nif (ReportDiagnostics(additionalFile.Diagnostics, consoleOutput, errorLogger, compilation, analyzers))\r\n . .\r\n . .\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nIn order for us not to change the current default functionality of the way the SARIF error logger works. In that regard we could introduce a new options such as:\r\n`/includeanalyzers{+|-}`\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n- Breaking changes in case any of the customers is using the rules fields or the SARIF format to make any kind of automatic action on the file produced by Roslyn.\r\n"},{"Id":"21088077379","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-03T22:27:27","Actor":"Youssef1313","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60549","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Move formatting analyzer to `Analyzers` layer\" (#60549) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"21087695783","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-03T21:11:58","Actor":"Youssef1313","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60548","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Delete src/CodeStyle/Core/Analyzers/Extensions directory\" (#60548) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"21086761810","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-03T18:24:26","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/32070","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Getting Issue With ExtractMethodCodeRefactoringProvider, Crashing With InvalidCastException\" (#32070) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"**Version Used**: VS 15.9.4 \r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\nI wish I could give a specific reproduction.

Backport of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/63314\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThe recently released Clang 13 has started to apply assumption that this pointer is always aligned to the natural alignment of the object. These break compilation of .NET Core 3.1 e.g. on Fedora 35 where Clang 13 is the one installed. This issue was reported by Red Hat developers.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nLocal builds of release and debug versions using clang 9 and clang 13\r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nLow, there are no functional changes and the fix has been in main and release/6.0 branches for about 2 months.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOriginal commit message:\r\n\r\n* Fix clang 13 induced runtime issues (#62170)\r\n\r\nThe clang 13 optimizer started to assume that \"this\" pointer is always\r\nproperly aligned. That lead to elimination of some code that was actually\r\nneeded.\r\nIt also takes pointer aliasing rules more strictly in one place in jit.\r\nThat caused the optimizer to falsely assume that a callee with an argument\r\npassed by reference is not modifying that argument and used a stale\r\ncopy of the original value at the caller site.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes both of the issues. With this fix, runtime compiled\r\nusing clang 13 seems to be fully functional.\r\n\r\ncc @janvorli ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28232","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Fix build with Clang 13 (#63314)\" (#28232)"},{"Id":"1102399747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-02-10T18:26:24","Actor":"josalem","Number":"28231","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Enable System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSouce.AllowDuplicateSourceNames for partner","State":"closed","Body":"This change is easier to view if you toggle \"ignore whitespace changes\" on in the GitHub UI.\r\n\r\nThis change backports the opt-in, off-by-default flag, `System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSouce.AllowDuplicateSourceNames`.\r\n\r\nThis flag, if enabled, will bypass the check for whether an EventSource already exists with a given name or GUID. This is a release valve only intended for users who make heavy use of AssemblyLoadContext and are experiencing exceptions from this code path. It does not solve any of the issues that may arise from enabling this configuration.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThere is negligible risk involved with this change for most users. It is off-by-default and requires conscious action on the user's part to enable.\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, there _is_ a moderate amount of risk, as it is not a rigorously tested or previously supported scenario. Partner team validation and local testing of various scenarios showed that for specific use cases, it is sufficient.\r\n\r\nBelow is a collection of sample scenarios and the results of the traces when viewed in PerfView:\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with the _same_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: All events are received and correctly parsed\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with _different_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(int foo = 1) => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(string foo = \"foo\") => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: The last manifest received by PerfView is the one that gets used, so the `int` version of `MyEvent` gets parsed as the `string` version. I expected this kind of behavior.\r\n\r\n### Multiple self-describing `EventSource`s with the _same_ events\r\n```csharp\r\nEventSource a = new(\"a\");\r\nEventSource aa = new(\"a\");\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\na.Write(\"MyEvent\");\r\naa.Write(\"MyEvent\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: All events are received and parsed correctly.\r\n\r\n### Multiple self-describing `EventSource`s with _different_ events\r\n```csharp\r\nEventSource a = new(\"a\");\r\nEventSource aa = new(\"a\");\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\na.Write(\"MyEvent\", new { a = 1 });\r\naa.Write(\"MyEvent\", new { b = 2 });\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: All events are received and parsed correctly.\r\n\r\nI ran into issues building release/3.1 locally on macOS that seem unrelated to these changes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28231","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Enable System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSouce.AllowDuplicateSourceNames for partner\" (#28231)"},{"Id":"1082798764","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-13T19:34:17","Actor":"ayakael","Number":"28226","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backports Fix build on Alpine edge dotnet/runtime#45352","State":"closed","Body":"Made as part of Alpine Linux dotnet31 / dotnet5 packaging project, see dotnet/source-build#2695","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28226","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backports Fix build on Alpine edge dotnet/runtime#45352\" (#28226)"},{"Id":"1080101814","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-12T21:10:56","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"28225","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a\r\n- **Build**: 20211111.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: November 11, 2021 7:34:26 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 3df4410511ad9900804da00ec680bd1c7d6f21e1\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.x\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 1.0.0-beta.21552.6 to 1.0.0-beta.21561.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed**: [from 2.2.0-beta.21552.6 to 2.2.0-beta.21561.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging**: [from 1.0.0-beta.21552.6 to 1.0.0-beta.21561.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 2.0.0-beta.21552.6 to 2.0.0-beta.21561.2][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/afb7961...3df4410\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28225","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#28225)"},{"Id":"1098230388","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-10T18:24:27","Actor":"hoyosjs","Number":"28230","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix pools for crossdac","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28230","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix pools for crossdac\" (#28230)"},{"Id":"1092921022","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-04T00:43:57","Actor":"josalem","Number":"28229","RawContent":null,"Title":"Handle case where shutdown deadlocks on m_lock","State":"open","Body":"*Opening as draft for feedback and test coverage*\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/51579\r\n\r\n> Specifically, the order of events that cause this to occur is as follows with the chronological order of events in parenthesis:\r\n>\r\n>Thread 1: SetSessionWriteInProgress(1) -> WriteEvent (2) -> AllocateBufferForThread (5) [blocked on m_lock]\r\n>Thread 2: SuspendWriteEvent(3) -> SuspendWriteEvent(4) [blocked on YIELD_WHILE on SessionWriteInProgress]\r\n\r\nThis issue was fixed in 5.0 via c6d1756, however that is a 10k LOC change and not ideal for a servicing change.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

So redefining stream's sync object to lock over `this` achieves the same thing as the fix in 5.0 since operations over `Http2Stream` are guarded with stream's lock and operations with credit lock credit manager itself (separate sync object for window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReliability problem.\r\nReported by customer using YARP.

Temporary workaround is to disable HTTP/2 for the endpoint - such solution does not scale for larger number of backends and might not be acceptable for other backends.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\nLocal test run for 3.1.\r\nWhen we fixed the issue in 5.0, we got a confirmation from the reporting customer that the fix helped and that it didn't break anything.\r\nYARP customer needing the 3.1 fix is unable to verify the fix on unsigned binaries.\r\n\r\n### Link to PR / issue in main\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220\r\n6.0 (main) PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769\r\n5.0.5 servicing PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47921\r\n\r\n### Is there a packaging impact?\r\n\r\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43116","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[H/2] Split lock to prevent deadlock in WindowUpdate processing\" (#43116)"},{"Id":"1157840655","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T17:41:49","Actor":"carlossanlop","Number":"43135","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/65741\r\n\r\nI had to update some queues based on the [platforms supported for 3.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1-supported-os.md):\r\n  - Windows 19H1 to 20H2\r\n  - MacOS 1013 and 1014 to 1015 and 1100\r\n\r\nMade sure all the queue names matched something that existed here: https://helix.dot.net/\r\n\r\nThe sample run is here: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=1641884&view=results\r\n\r\nKudos to @hoyosjs for helping me find the right places to change.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43135","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal\" (#43135)"},{"Id":"1114496999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T23:53:09","Actor":"bartonjs","Number":"43132","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues","State":"closed","Body":"Backport https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/48460 to release/3.1 so the tests don't fail on Apple systems that no longer trust the relevant root authority.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43132","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues\" (#43132)"},{"Id":"1082811783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T02:39:11","Actor":"ayakael","Number":"43129","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1]Add RID for Alpine 3.15","State":"closed","Body":"Contributes to dotnet/core#6985\r\nI havn't seen this popup yet, so here is a merge request to add RID for Alpine 3.15.

It's not necessary to find a diagnostic for `CA5351` in order for the rule to be present in the SARIF file.\r\n- The `rule` object gets a new property, respecting the SARIF format, that shows us what's the default level of the rule (warning, error) and if its enabled.\r\n\r\n### Necessary changes\r\nUnder `CommonCompiler.cs` we will have to pass the information about the analyzers to the error logger. Of course the SARIF logger will have to change to include those rules.\r\n\r\nMore specifically the changes could be under:\r\n### CommonCompiler.cs\r\n``` cs\r\nprivate int RunCore(TextWriter consoleOutput, ErrorLogger? errorLogger, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n{\r\n . .\r\n . .\r\nif (ReportDiagnostics(additionalFile.Diagnostics, consoleOutput, errorLogger, compilation, analyzers))\r\n . .\r\n . .\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nIn order for us not to change the current default functionality of the way the SARIF error logger works. In that regard we could introduce a new options such as:\r\n`/includeanalyzers{+|-}`\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n- Breaking changes in case any of the customers is using the rules fields or the SARIF format to make any kind of automatic action on the file produced by Roslyn.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/60550","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SARIF Error Logger - Should include the analyzers(rules) that where used\" (#60550)"},{"Id":"1191064998","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-03T22:27:27","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"60549","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move formatting analyzer to `Analyzers` layer","State":"open","Body":"There were two versions of formatting analyzer.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) was shipped in May 30, 2018 and was declared an LTS release with the 2.1.3 update in August 2018. The 3-year lifecycle for the 2.1 release has come to an end on August 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.1 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.1 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.1, will be accessible through the [.NET Downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) page. \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.1 has reached end of life\" (#199)"},{"Id":"974082248","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-08-18T21:49:10","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Main is now targeting .NET 7","State":"open","Body":"This is a heads up that the primary repos of the stack have branched for .NET 6 GA/servicing/RCs, and that the `main` branch for those repos has become .NET 7.\r\n\r\n## Anything special to note about .NET 7?\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between .NET 6 and .NET 7 flow is that the SDK repos will have their own channel (.NET 7.0.1xx SDK) from the very beginning.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"updating-2.1\"></a> Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework\r\nIf you are running .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework you need to check your projects for dependencies and update them accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\n* If your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 2.1 incrementally. This means that users who reference the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` package must add a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\n* The shared framework for .NET Core 3.1 and later does not include `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.dll`. Users targeting netcoreapp3.1 or later must also update their `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package version.\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 3.1 and later completely. This means users who reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` can bump that version to 2.1.30. They don't need a new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` reference.\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core or .NET 5, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

At the same time, continuing to build for all frameworks we ever shipped increases the complexity and size of a package. In the past, we've solved this issue by *harvesting*, which basically means:\r\n \r\n1. We build only for \"current\" frameworks\r\n2. During build, we download the earlier version of the package and \"harvest\" the binaries for earlier frameworks we no longer build for\r\n \r\nWhile this means that you can always update without worrying that we drop a framework it also means that you'll never get any bug fixes or new features if you consume a harvested binary. In other words, harvested assets can't be serviced which is now hidden because from your point of view you're able to keep updating the package to a later version even thought you're consuming the same old binary that we're no longer updating.\r\n \r\nFor .NET 6, we plan to no longer perform any form of harvesting to ensure that all assets we ship can be serviced. This means we're dropping anything older than:\r\n\r\n* .NET Framework 4.6.1\r\n* .NET Core 3.1\r\n* .NET Standard 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're currently referencing an impacted package from an earlier framework, you'll no longer be able to update the referenced package to a later version. Your choice is to either retarget your project to a later version or not updating the referenced package (which is generally not a huge take back because you're already consuming a frozen binary anyways).\r\n \r\n## Affected packages\r\n\r\nThese packages no longer ship old frameworks:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry.AccessControl`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition.Registration`\r\n* `System.Composition.AttributedModel`\r\n* `System.Composition.Convention`\r\n* `System.Composition.Hosting`\r\n* `System.Composition.Runtime`\r\n* `System.Composition.TypedParts`\r\n* `System.Data.Odbc`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.EventLog`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols`\r\n* `System.Drawing.Common`\r\n* `System.IO.Packaging`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipelines`\r\n* `System.Management`\r\n* `System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler`\r\n* `System.Reflection.Context`\r\n* `System.Runtime.Caching`\r\n* `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData`\r\n* `System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController`\r\n* `System.Speech`\r\n* `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages`\r\n* `System.Text.Encodings.Web`\r\n* `System.Threading.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Threading.Channels`\r\n\r\nThese packages will no longer be updated because their implementation is now part of the .NET 6 platform:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.IO.FileSystem.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Principal.Windows`\r\n\r\n## Timelines\r\n\r\nMany of these changes are shipping in .NET 6 Preview 5 while some will ship in .NET 6 Preview 6.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please comment in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54365.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/190","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dropping older framework versions\" (#190)"},{"Id":"915260827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-06-08T17:03:51","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0 and .NET Core 3.1.

This shift is intended to make it easier for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) customers to choose whether to allow .NET 6 and beyond on their environments, without the side effects a key shared between multiple products might have.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nToday Microsoft signs .NET artifacts with a variety of certificates. For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change.

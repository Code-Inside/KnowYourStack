The Linker removed the function definition and single implementation in question - they no longer exist in the assembly to call.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis is probably a regression, but I have not looked at how far back this occurred.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidated a patched version of `System.Private.CoreLib` against a XAML Island scenario from https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Islands-Samples.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n/cc @jeffschwMSFT @jkotas @jkoritzinsky "},{"Id":"12905616185","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T22:59:45","Actor":"Anipik","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28053","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[release/2.1] Fix CancellationTokenRegistration.Token after CTS.Dispose\" (#28053) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Ports https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21417 from 2.2 to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n\r\nCTR.Token should never throw, but it's currently throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed.\r\n\r\nDetails: We added the CancellationTokenRegistration.Token property in .NET Core 2.1.  Since the CTR already knows with what token it's associated, allowing you to get the token from the CTR saves you from also needing to separately store the token, which lets you improve memory utilization by not carrying it around effectively twice.  We took advantage of that, for example, in FileStream's Read/WriteAsync operations, to decrease the size of the object allocated for those operations.  However, the CTR.Token property is incorrectly throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed, which introduces an ODE where there wasn't previously one (just accessing a CancellationToken you already had stored).  This is causing regressions in code that created a token source, registered with its token, and then disposed the source.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nExceptions on background threads that crash the process when performing operations like:\r\n```C#\r\nvar cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\nTask<int> t = fileStream.ReadAsync(..., cts.Token);\r\ncts.Dispose();\r\nint result = await t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe fixed this in 2.2 but so far held off on backporting to 2.1 pending more customer data since it's an LTS release. Since then we've had 2 more reports (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37641) most recently a customer that says:\r\n\r\n> It may take the rest of the year to reach 3.1. In the meantime our servers are crashing and clients are getting mad! I can only apologize to them, mitigate the issues as best as possible and then blame you for not updating an LTS version!\r\n\r\nSince the change is very low risk -- it's been in the product since 2.2 -- we are proposing we now backport to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes.  It's not a regression in CancellationTokenRegistration.Token, which was only introduced in 2.1, but rather a regression in that it's behavior isn't matching code it was used to replace, so it's for example a regression in FileStream.Read/WriteAsync.\r\n\r\n#### Packaging reviewed? \r\n\r\nChange affects System.Private.CoreLib only.\r\n\r\n#### Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.  The new code is effectively the same as the old, except avoiding a ThrowIfDisposed call.\r\ncc: @danmosemsft "},{"Id":"12905613748","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T22:59:18","Actor":"Anipik","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28051","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Port to 3.1 - Fix JIT_CheckedWriteBarrier on macOS\" (#28051) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Port of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/38242\r\n\r\nIn a change to enable Mojave hardened runtime support that was made last\r\nyear, a bug was introduced into the JIT_CheckedWriteBarrier.

On Linux-based environments, customers that explicitly or implicitly use `X509Chain` to build a certificate that cause an AIA fetch and the server improperly responds successfully but with empty content will cause a null pointer dereference in native code, which will result in an unrecoverable hard crash of the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes. Prior to .NET Core 3.0, a managed exception was thrown instead of an access violation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe original fix against dotnet/runtime contains a unit test to prevent further regressions.

(For a full context of why we need that, please refer to the gitter conversation, or feel free to contact me directly)\r\n\r\nThanks to all the great work that's already been done via LLVM for wasm, perhaps the project wouldn't be as crazy as I immediately think.\r\n\r\nWith help from @MichalStrehovsky and @yowl, and based on Michal's zerosharp code, I got a tiny little no-corelib Hello world to compile via LLVM an x86 Mac executable:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corert/compare/master...christianscheuer:macllvm\r\n\r\nTo test it, make sure to install the prerequisites (it needs llvm 10.0 and the MacOS 10.13 SDK installed, see the README for more info), then build CoreRT in Debug and skip the tests: `./build.sh skiptests`, then go into the `tests/src/llvm` directory and run `./build.sh`.\r\nIt will run CSC to compile to IL, run the modified ILC from the repo to compile to bitcode (which uses the WebAssembly LLVM backend with some hardcoded modifications) - and then use the installed LLVM 10 linker (it needs to be the same major version of LLVM that's used to produce the bitcode, and we're using libLLVM 10 to produce the bitcode) to produce a runnable executable. It then runs it, it prints Hello world and returns 42 :)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow all of this raises a bunch of questions it would be great to get your input to.\r\n\r\n- Assuming that we would be going down this path, I expect the first step would be to look at how to refactor the WebAssembly backend so that a new, generic ILToLLVMImporter can be created as a base class, and have ILToWebAssemblyImporter inherit from that, as well as other derived classes for the new x86, x64, arm64 targets (or, some other structure). For example, I suspect many opcode importers, stack management etc. should be the same no matter if the \"architecture\" is wasm or x64 (accounting for different pointer sizes), so there should be a lot of code that can be reused. Things like the shadow stack however I don't think we'll need for anything but wasm, if I understand the reasons behind it correctly, so there would be a challenge to see how to structure the code so both a shadow stack based and regular stack based version can coexist.\r\nSo the question is - with all of this in mind: How would you approach code structuring of such an endeavor?\r\nObviously we can do a clean copy-paste into a different directory, but I thought the two implementations could benefit from each other if they were linked...\r\n\r\n- Overall engineering plan\r\nWhat would be the best way to approach the rest of the bringup, once that initial refactor has been done? What would be the best order of x64-ifying it (ie. add support for 8 byte pointer sizes, potentially remove the shadow stack, etc.)\r\nAny other considerations?\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"12904368578","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T20:12:10","Actor":"yowl","Repository":"dotnet/corert","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8229","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"WIP: Wasm: fix commit version for emsdk\" (#8229) at dotnet/corert","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"12896519394","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T06:41:22","Actor":"MichalStrehovsky","Repository":"dotnet/corert","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8228","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Collapse MetadataWriter into MetadataTransform\" (#8228) at dotnet/corert","RelatedBody":"The original reason why these were split is to make it possible to share the writer with the .NET Native compiler.

Include both the message and the stack trace\r\n\r\nFor `dotnet ef` and PMC, share the --verbose output\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor the steps I mostly reuse the EF Getting Started tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/).\r\n1. Prepare the project\r\n   a. `dotnet new web -o EFGetStarted`\r\n   b. `cd EFGetStarted`\r\n   c. `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`\r\n   d. `dotnet new tool-manifest`\r\n   e. `dotnet tool install dotnet-ef`\r\n   f. `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`\r\n   g. Add Model.cs\r\n      ```csharp\r\n        using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n        using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\n\r\n        namespace EFGetStarted\r\n        {\r\n            public class BloggingContext : DbContext\r\n            {\r\n                public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }\r\n                public DbSet<Post> Posts { get; set; }\r\n\r\n                protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder options)\r\n                    => options.UseSqlServer(\"_\");\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public class Blog\r\n            {\r\n                public int BlogId { get; set; }\r\n                public string Url { get; set; }\r\n\r\n                public List<Post> Posts { get; } = new List<Post>();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public class Post\r\n            {\r\n                public int PostId { get; set; }\r\n                public string Title { get; set; }\r\n                public string Content { get; set; } \r\n\r\n                public int BlogId { get; set; }\r\n                public Blog Blog { get; set; }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n      ```\r\n   h. `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate`\r\n2. `rm -rf bin` for clean slate\r\n3. `dotnet publish -c Release`\r\n4. `ls bin` __note that Release dir is present, no Debug folder__\r\n5. Edit EFGetStarted.csproj. This enables script generation and triggers the issue.\r\n    ```xml\r\n    <ItemGroup>\r\n      <EFMigrations Include=\"EFGetStarted.BloggingContext\" />\r\n    </ItemGroup>\r\n    ```\r\n6. `rm -rf bin`\r\n7. `dotnet publish -c Release`\r\n8. `ls bin`  __note that Release and Debug dirs are present and both contain binaries__\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n\r\n```\r\n$>dotnet info\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.201\r\n Commit:    b1768b4ae7\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     ubuntu\r\n OS Version:  18.04\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         ubuntu.18.04-x64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/3.1.201/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.3\r\n  Commit:  4a9f85e9f8\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.201 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.3 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.3 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nAFAIS, script generation runs `dotnet ef` command underneath (`GenerateEFSqlScripts` task run from `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Publish.TransformFiles.targets`), but doesn't pass any msbuild properties set in the encompassing build. Maybe it should at least pass the `Configuration` property. It could also additionally pass `--no-build`. After all we are in a publish, the binaries have just been built. A possible workaround is to do it on our own by using `EFMigrationsAdditionalArgs` property. But it's all hard to notice and discover, especially that this whole secondary build is completely absent from the logs.\r\n"},{"Id":"12906392817","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-15T01:30:27","Actor":"javiercn","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/12464","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Option to disable importing the TypeScript SDK implicitly\" (#12464) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This leads to a broken experience if you have issues with loading tasks on the typescript SDK, even when you are not using them.\r\n\r\nThere should be an option to disable this:\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/websdk/blob/master/src/ProjectSystem/Targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web.ProjectSystem.props#L25-L26\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript\\3.8\\build\\Microsoft.TypeScript.targets(223,5): error MSB4062: The \"TypeScript.Tasks.CheckF ileSystemCaseSensitive\" task could not be loaded from the assembly C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript\\3.8\\build\\TypeScript.Ta sks.dll.

prune the IManagedActivationFactory type","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a user reported issue for consuming XAML Islands in .NET 3.1. The result is a random failure typically during XAML load. The managed definition of [`IManagedActivationFactory`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/68ec8a211852cc9cf662d19bac251f364719702f/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/WindowsRuntime/ManagedActivationFactory.cs#L10-L16) has been pruned of its function and thus when a call is made to a class implementing that interface, random memory is executed since there is no entry in the vtable.\r\n\r\nThe scenario involving this code was [removed in .NET 5.0](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37672) so there is no need to bring the work forward.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nUsers will be unable to use XAML Islands or WinUI with bindings in .NET 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no work around. The Linker removed the function definition and single implementation in question - they no longer exist in the assembly to call.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis is probably a regression, but I have not identified the exact location where the break was introduced.\r\n\r\nConfirmed the method is missing and broken in [3.0.1](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/Sdk/release/3.0.1xx/dotnet-sdk-latest-win-x64.exe), but the method is present in 2.2.7.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidated a patched version of `System.Private.CoreLib` against a XAML Island scenario from https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Islands-Samples.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n/cc @jeffschwMSFT @jkotas @jkoritzinsky ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28061","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Don't prune the IManagedActivationFactory type\" (#28061)"},{"Id":"648602879","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T22:59:44","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"28053","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/2.1] Fix CancellationTokenRegistration.Token after CTS.Dispose","State":"closed","Body":"Ports https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21417 from 2.2 to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n\r\nCTR.Token should never throw, but it's currently throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed.\r\n\r\nDetails: We added the CancellationTokenRegistration.Token property in .NET Core 2.1.  Since the CTR already knows with what token it's associated, allowing you to get the token from the CTR saves you from also needing to separately store the token, which lets you improve memory utilization by not carrying it around effectively twice.  We took advantage of that, for example, in FileStream's Read/WriteAsync operations, to decrease the size of the object allocated for those operations.  However, the CTR.Token property is incorrectly throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed, which introduces an ODE where there wasn't previously one (just accessing a CancellationToken you already had stored).  This is causing regressions in code that created a token source, registered with its token, and then disposed the source.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nExceptions on background threads that crash the process when performing operations like:\r\n```C#\r\nvar cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\nTask<int> t = fileStream.ReadAsync(..., cts.Token);\r\ncts.Dispose();\r\nint result = await t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe fixed this in 2.2 but so far held off on backporting to 2.1 pending more customer data since it's an LTS release. Since then we've had 2 more reports (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37641) most recently a customer that says:\r\n\r\n> It may take the rest of the year to reach 3.1. In the meantime our servers are crashing and clients are getting mad! I can only apologize to them, mitigate the issues as best as possible and then blame you for not updating an LTS version!\r\n\r\nSince the change is very low risk -- it's been in the product since 2.2 -- we are proposing we now backport to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes.  It's not a regression in CancellationTokenRegistration.Token, which was only introduced in 2.1, but rather a regression in that it's behavior isn't matching code it was used to replace, so it's for example a regression in FileStream.Read/WriteAsync.\r\n\r\n#### Packaging reviewed? \r\n\r\nChange affects System.Private.CoreLib only.\r\n\r\n#### Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.  The new code is effectively the same as the old, except avoiding a ThrowIfDisposed call.\r\ncc: @danmosemsft ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28053","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix CancellationTokenRegistration.Token after CTS.Dispose\" (#28053)"},{"Id":"643722922","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T22:59:17","Actor":"janvorli","Number":"28051","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port to 3.1 - Fix JIT_CheckedWriteBarrier on macOS","State":"closed","Body":"Port of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/38242\r\n\r\nIn a change to enable Mojave hardened runtime support that was made last\r\nyear, a bug was introduced into the JIT_CheckedWriteBarrier.

The hand written Amd64 instruction parser was flaky and nearly impossible to maintain.\r\n\r\nThe problem arose because the debugger must determine the length and form of the instruction where the breakpoint is inserted. The original code was a minimal implementation which only covered the instruction form historically used by the JIT.  As new forms and especially intrinsics were added, the code was not updated because the complexity was far too high. \r\n\r\nWe completely missed decode of all x64 simd instruction forms.\r\n\r\nThe fix required was this substantial change. At the time we missed the 3.0 branch and we did not have sufficient feedback to consider backport to 3.x.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n+ This code was manually tested to fix the originally reported issue.\r\n  + Additionally the same code was tested for regressions in other areas.\r\n    + Trying a breakpoint on every line of code\r\n    + Stepping through every line of code \r\n+ The code has been in the 5.0 branch for more than 6 months with no new regressions\r\n  + Shipped in all .NET Core 5.0 previews to date\r\n  + Over the last 90 days, there have been \r\n     + 184K debugging sessions launched on .NET Core 5 previews\r\n     + from 3.3K unique MAC addresses\r\n  + We have no reports of issues linked to this fix\r\n+ The 5.0 code has been tested against recently reported similar issues\r\n  + We have several confirmation that this issue observed in 3.0/3.1 has been fixed by 5.0 \r\n+ The internal diagnostic test suite was amended to test for this issue and prevent further identical regressions.\r\n+ @tommcdon & @hoyosjs have each used the x64 debugger since this change for debugging various reported/discovered issues. They saw no issues suggesting a regression.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n+ dotnet/coreclr#25958 has been in 5.0 since 9/2019\r\n+ Only affects x64 debugger operation. \r\n+ Removes a flaky instruction parser and replaces it with a machine generated one.  \r\n  + Rewrites one function `NativeWalker::DecodeInstructionForPatchSkip()`.

A usage pattern that worsens this leak is to start tracing, fill up all the buffers, then stop tracing, and repeat that many times. This fix mitigates the issue by making EventPipeBuffer to use ClrVirtualAlloc instead of malloc.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nOn Linux platforms (specifically ones that use glibc), customers may see an unexpected growth in the native heap size over a long period of time if using EventPipe for a long time (ex. using Application Insights Service Profiler), making our first-party and third-party tracing solutions potentially problematic in production scenarios when used for elongated periods of time.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNo, EventPipe buffers were always allocated using malloc.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe fix was tested against the scenario the customer provided and .

If the server (incorrectly) responds with a successful status code, but an empty response, we attempt to re-build the chain with an X509 certificate that is in an invalid state. This invalid state results in a null pointer being dereferenced in native code, which causes a crash of the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported by a customer in dotnet/runtime#38704. On Linux-based environments, customers that explicitly or implicitly use `X509Chain` to build a certificate that cause an AIA fetch and the server improperly responds successfully but with empty content will cause a null pointer dereference in native code, which will result in an unrecoverable hard crash of the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes. Prior to .NET Core 3.0, a managed exception was thrown instead of an access violation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe original fix against dotnet/runtime contains a unit test to prevent further regressions. The test is not ported here due to missing testing faculties for AIA fetching.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low**.

(For a full context of why we need that, please refer to the gitter conversation, or feel free to contact me directly)\r\n\r\nThanks to all the great work that's already been done via LLVM for wasm, perhaps the project wouldn't be as crazy as I immediately think.\r\n\r\nWith help from @MichalStrehovsky and @yowl, and based on Michal's zerosharp code, I got a tiny little no-corelib Hello world to compile via LLVM an x86 Mac executable:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corert/compare/master...christianscheuer:macllvm\r\n\r\nTo test it, make sure to install the prerequisites (it needs llvm 10.0 and the MacOS 10.13 SDK installed, see the README for more info), then build CoreRT in Debug and skip the tests: `./build.sh skiptests`, then go into the `tests/src/llvm` directory and run `./build.sh`.\r\nIt will run CSC to compile to IL, run the modified ILC from the repo to compile to bitcode (which uses the WebAssembly LLVM backend with some hardcoded modifications) - and then use the installed LLVM 10 linker (it needs to be the same major version of LLVM that's used to produce the bitcode, and we're using libLLVM 10 to produce the bitcode) to produce a runnable executable. It then runs it, it prints Hello world and returns 42 :)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow all of this raises a bunch of questions it would be great to get your input to.\r\n\r\n- Assuming that we would be going down this path, I expect the first step would be to look at how to refactor the WebAssembly backend so that a new, generic ILToLLVMImporter can be created as a base class, and have ILToWebAssemblyImporter inherit from that, as well as other derived classes for the new x86, x64, arm64 targets (or, some other structure). For example, I suspect many opcode importers, stack management etc. should be the same no matter if the \"architecture\" is wasm or x64 (accounting for different pointer sizes), so there should be a lot of code that can be reused. Things like the shadow stack however I don't think we'll need for anything but wasm, if I understand the reasons behind it correctly, so there would be a challenge to see how to structure the code so both a shadow stack based and regular stack based version can coexist.\r\nSo the question is - with all of this in mind: How would you approach code structuring of such an endeavor?\r\nObviously we can do a clean copy-paste into a different directory, but I thought the two implementations could benefit from each other if they were linked...\r\n\r\n- Overall engineering plan\r\nWhat would be the best way to approach the rest of the bringup, once that initial refactor has been done? What would be the best order of x64-ifying it (ie. add support for 8 byte pointer sizes, potentially remove the shadow stack, etc.)\r\nAny other considerations?\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8230","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Investigating LLVM as a general backend for x86, x64 and arm64 code generation\" (#8230)"},{"Id":"656869635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T20:12:09","Actor":"yowl","Number":"8229","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: Wasm: fix commit version for emsdk","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8229","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: Wasm: fix commit version for emsdk\" (#8229)"},{"Id":"656116271","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T06:41:21","Actor":"MichalStrehovsky","Number":"8228","RawContent":null,"Title":"Collapse MetadataWriter into MetadataTransform","State":"closed","Body":"The original reason why these were split is to make it possible to share the writer with the .NET Native compiler.

Can someone confirm this assert is valid for conservative GC?\r\nThanks.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8205","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Wasm: Question: conservative gc and heap_segment_allocated\" (#8205)"},{"Id":"637485404","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-12T05:01:50","Actor":"VS-ux","Number":"8202","RawContent":null,"Title":"CoreRT using too much memory","State":"open","Body":"Hi all!\r\nI tried out CoreRT on my winforms application which I've recently ported to .NET Core 3.1, from .NET Framework 4.8, using this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/winforms).

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\r\n\r\nExploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Core. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core checks the source markup of a file.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application running on .NET Core 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.0, you should download and install Runtime 3.0.2 or SDK 3.0.102 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.1 or SDK 3.1.101 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 3.0 and 3.1 installed, you need to install the updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

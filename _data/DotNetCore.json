These packages will be maintained by the .NET team and kept up to date as part of each servicing release for each of the supported .NET versions.\r\n\r\nThese are the package identifiers of the new set of packages to be added:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.Preview\r\n\r\n## Implementation Timeline\r\n\r\n1. Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428"},{"Id":"21598179327","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T16:38:05","Actor":"leecow","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/217","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)\" (#217) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Package Maintenance\r\n\r\n.NET Core was released in June 2016, and over the last six years, many thousands of NuGet packages have been published under the .NET umbrella. Many of these packages are legacy or out-of-support already. As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered.

This was a deadlock risk because the start of the diagnostic service could happen from any thread, but we were blocking on the availability of the UI thread for that to actually work.\r\n\r\nThis deadlock risk turned out to be true for at least one unlucky user as they hit a specific case where the UI thread was blocked trying to acquire the workspace lock. The workspace lock was held by another thread that was also trying to acquire a lock around the creation of an analyzer. A third thread was holding that analyzer lock and since it was trying to report diagnostics, deadlocked here since the UI thread was not available to get everything moving again.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, I don't see any reason the code in StartListening needs to be happening synchronously; it appears to be correctly looking at the current state of CurrentSolution to see what projects might have been added before it first noticed. Making this properly async is probably the best improvement we can make, because not only does it fix this one specific user's unlucky deadlock, it also fixes any other cases where other components are also pushing diagnostics and might find ourselves in a loop. It also generally brings this bit of code into compliance with the VS threading rules.\r\n\r\nFixes https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Deadlock-Upon-Opening-Visual-Studio/10037282\r\nFixes https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1556900 (the internal tracking for the item above)"},{"Id":"22405149583","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T23:07:39","Actor":"sharwell","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/62004","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add IDE0240 (Remove redundant nullable directive)\" (#62004) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"22404784816","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T22:22:05","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/61281","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"C# Code Generator and Code Analyzer don't Recognize Nested Enum as Belonging to Current Generic Class\" (#61281) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/C-Code-Generator-and-Code-Analyzer-don/10039068)._\n\n---\n[severity:It bothers me. A fix would be nice]\r\nAuto-generation of a code snippet with an enum nested in a generic class adds the identifier of the class we're in as superfluous qualifier.\n\nSample code:\n\n```\nnamespace DemoCodeAnalyzerOnNestedEnum\n{\n    internal class DemoClassWithNestedEnum\n    {\n        public enum DemoNestedEnum\n        {\n            First,\n            Second\n        }\n\n        public static string DemoNestedEnumUsage()\n        {\n            var demoNestedEnumValue = ((new Random()).Next(2) == 0) ? DemoNestedEnum.First : DemoNestedEnum.Second;\n\n            switch\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nPut the cursor immediately behind the keyword \"switch\", press [Tab], replace the selected \"switch_on\" by \"demoNestedEnumValue\", and press \"Enter\". \n\nObserved result (switch block only):\n\n```\n            switch (demoNestedEnumValue)\n            {\n                case DemoClassWithNestedEnum.DemoNestedEnum.First:\n                    break;\n                case DemoClassWithNestedEnum.DemoNestedEnum.Second:\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    break;\n            }\n```\nExpected result (switch block only):\n\n```\n            switch (demoNestedEnumValue)\n            {\n                case DemoNestedEnum.First:\n                    break;\n                case DemoNestedEnum.Second:\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    break;\n            }\n```\n\nWith a non-generic class, the code generation runs just fine.\n\nNot only the code generator, but also the code analyzer has a flaw here: it doesn't issue a message \"Simplify member access (IDE0002)\". (In a non-generic class, it does.)\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/11/2022, 10:59 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no

This is a release valve only intended for users who make heavy use of AssemblyLoadContext and are experiencing exceptions from this code path.

It is off-by-default and requires conscious action on the user's part to enable.\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, there _is_ a moderate amount of risk, as it is not a rigorously tested or previously supported scenario. Partner team validation and local testing of various scenarios showed that for specific use cases, it is sufficient.\r\n\r\nBelow is a collection of sample scenarios and the results of the traces when viewed in PerfView:\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with the _same_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: All events are received and correctly parsed\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with _different_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(int foo = 1) => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(string foo = \"foo\") => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: The last manifest received by PerfView is the one that gets used, so the `int` version of `MyEvent` gets parsed as the `string` version.

I have a function that returns a List<Animal> from the database with no issue. It returns 11 results. However, when I try to use `.Where(p => p.DeletedAt.GetValueOrDefault(DateTime.Now) => DateTime.Now).ToList()`, it still should return 11 results, however it returns 0. I also eliminated the possibility that there is something wrong with my where clause (logic) because it works perfectly on 4.6.1 EF Core 2.2.6. Furthermore, I confirmed that it is only where I am comparing a nullable type using that function and I am guessing that I missed a thread someone opened on this issue. I am aware .NET core 2.2 is not LTS.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

As an example provided in that issue, this memory manager:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\nprivate sealed class BasicMemoryManager : MemoryManager<byte>\r\n{\r\n    private readonly byte[] _buffer;\r\n    public BasicMemoryManager(int size = 1024) => _buffer = new byte[size];\r\n\r\n    protected override bool TryGetArray(out ArraySegment<byte> segment)\r\n    {\r\n        segment = new ArraySegment<byte>(_buffer);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    public override Span<byte> GetSpan() => _buffer;\r\n\r\n    public override MemoryHandle Pin(int elementIndex = 0) => throw new NotSupportedException();\r\n    public override void Unpin() => throw new NotSupportedException();\r\n    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail two of the following tests:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n[Theory]\r\n[InlineData(0, 32)]\r\n[InlineData(0, 29)]\r\n[InlineData(32, 32)] // fail: length 0\r\n[InlineData(32, 29)] // fail: length -3\r\npublic void OffsetTest(int offset, int length)\r\n{\r\n    var mgr = new BasicMemoryManager(1024);\r\n    var slice = mgr.Memory.Slice(offset, length);\r\n    Assert.Equal(length, slice.Length);\r\n\r\n    var ros = new ReadOnlySequence<byte>(slice);\r\n    Assert.True(ros.IsSingleSegment);\r\n    Assert.Equal(length, ros.Length);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nFailing test has been added in this PR.\r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nLow, as the change is very simple and obvious when you look at `ReadOnlySequence<T>` ctor that accepts `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` (notice line 133 versus lines 140 and 148):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/0d40b482e6b6c232131dc808182d6b32d9d37394/src/System.Memory/src/System/Buffers/ReadOnlySequence.cs#L130-L149\r\n\r\nMoreover, the changed code gets triggered only when creating a `ReadOnlySequence` from a `ReadOnlyMemory` backed by a `MemoryManager`. All other use cases (including creating from an array or from a `ReadOnlyMemory` backed by an array or a string) are unaffected. And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43141","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix ReadOnlySequence created out of sliced Memory owned by MemoryManager\" (#43141)"},{"Id":"1224389900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:24:35","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.26","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43143","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.26\" (#43143)"},{"Id":"1202264239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T04:53:34","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43142)"},{"Id":"1193653850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:51:59","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140)"},{"Id":"1193635046","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T20:08:46","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43139","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43139","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43139)"},{"Id":"1170308034","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T21:59:36","Actor":"Mr-Tao","Number":"43138","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Add missing Oracle RIDs","State":"open","Body":"This change adds previously missing RIDs for OL releases 7, 8 and 9 and respective RHEL counterparts.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43138","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Add missing Oracle RIDs\" (#43138)"},{"Id":"1157840655","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T17:41:49","Actor":"carlossanlop","Number":"43135","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/65741\r\n\r\nI had to update some queues based on the [platforms supported for 3.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1-supported-os.md):\r\n  - Windows 19H1 to 20H2\r\n  - MacOS 1013 and 1014 to 1015 and 1100\r\n\r\nMade sure all the queue names matched something that existed here: https://helix.dot.net/\r\n\r\nThe sample run is here: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=1641884&view=results\r\n\r\nKudos to @hoyosjs for helping me find the right places to change.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43135","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal\" (#43135)"},{"Id":"1114496999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T23:53:09","Actor":"bartonjs","Number":"43132","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues","State":"closed","Body":"Backport https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/48460 to release/3.1 so the tests don't fail on Apple systems that no longer trust the relevant root authority.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43132","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues\" (#43132)"},{"Id":"1082811783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T02:39:11","Actor":"ayakael","Number":"43129","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1]Add RID for Alpine 3.15","State":"closed","Body":"Contributes to dotnet/core#6985\r\nI havn't seen this popup yet, so here is a merge request to add RID for Alpine 3.15.

This was a deadlock risk because the start of the diagnostic service could happen from any thread, but we were blocking on the availability of the UI thread for that to actually work.\r\n\r\nThis deadlock risk turned out to be true for at least one unlucky user as they hit a specific case where the UI thread was blocked trying to acquire the workspace lock. The workspace lock was held by another thread that was also trying to acquire a lock around the creation of an analyzer. A third thread was holding that analyzer lock and since it was trying to report diagnostics, deadlocked here since the UI thread was not available to get everything moving again.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, I don't see any reason the code in StartListening needs to be happening synchronously; it appears to be correctly looking at the current state of CurrentSolution to see what projects might have been added before it first noticed. Making this properly async is probably the best improvement we can make, because not only does it fix this one specific user's unlucky deadlock, it also fixes any other cases where other components are also pushing diagnostics and might find ourselves in a loop. It also generally brings this bit of code into compliance with the VS threading rules.\r\n\r\nFixes https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Deadlock-Upon-Opening-Visual-Studio/10037282\r\nFixes https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1556900 (the internal tracking for the item above)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/62001","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix deadlock during the startup of diagnostics\" (#62001)"},{"Id":"1275567256","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T23:07:39","Actor":"sharwell","Number":"62004","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add analyzers to unnecessary nullable directives","State":"open","Body":"* [x] IDE0240: Remove redundant nullable directive (directive has no impact because the state prior to it already matched\r\n* [ ] IDE0241: Remove unnecessary nullable directive (directive reduces nullable analysis scope, but there are no reference types impacted by the scope reduction)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/62004","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add analyzers to unnecessary nullable directives\" (#62004)"},{"Id":"1275297165","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T22:06:23","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"61995","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a fast exit check for type-argument-list brace completion to help avoid semantic work when unnecessary","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/61995","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add a fast exit check for type-argument-list brace completion to help avoid semantic work when unnecessary\" (#61995)"},{"Id":"1275302348","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T22:06:20","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"61996","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simplify brace completion code.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/61996","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Simplify brace completion code.\" (#61996)"},{"Id":"1275511690","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T21:48:27","Actor":"tmat","Number":"62003","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make IFormattingInteractionService.GetFormattingChangesAsync synchronous","State":"open","Body":"This requires updating TypeScript to avoid async code path.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/62003","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make IFormattingInteractionService.GetFormattingChangesAsync synchronous\" (#62003)"},{"Id":"1275508516","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T21:42:22","Actor":"tmat","Number":"62002","RawContent":null,"Title":"Read syntax tree, source text and options synchronously in command handlers","State":"open","Body":"Use `ParsedDocument` and read options from `IEditorOptions`.\r\n\r\nContributes to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/57554\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/61935\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/62002","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Read syntax tree, source text and options synchronously in command handlers\" (#62002)"},{"Id":"1274879814","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T21:41:28","Actor":"DoctorKrolic","Number":"61988","RawContent":null,"Title":"Point workitems to the PR & clarification comment","State":"closed","Body":"Follow up to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/61809\r\n\r\nSwitched `WorkItem`s to point to the PR, not to the issue they don't test.

When using an API that has an overload it feels bad that a string isn't being highlighted or completion isn't working, until a certain point of time when you've provided enough arguments that only one method is remaining.\r\n\r\nThe detector could be improved to check all the overloads, and if the parameter at the position has the same `StringSyntax` value in all overloads then use it.\r\n\r\nThe reason I noticed it is the popular ASP.NET Core minimal API has two overloads for each method.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic static class RouteEndpointExtensions\r\n{\r\n    public static IEndpointConvertionBuilder MapGet(this IEndpointRouteBuilder endpoints, [StringSyntax(\"Route\")] string pattern, Delegate delegate);\r\n    public static IEndpointConvertionBuilder MapGet(this IEndpointRouteBuilder endpoints, [StringSyntax(\"Route\")] string pattern, RequestDelegate delegate);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe pattern parameter isn't highlighted until the overload is figured out, which happens after the pattern and delegate are written.\r\n```cs\r\nendpoints.MapGet(\"my // <- not detected\r\nendpoints.MapGet(\"myroute\", // <- not detected\r\nendpoints.MapGet(\"myroute\", () => \"\" // <- finally detected\r\n```\r\nThis makes route syntax much less useful. You only get it once you've finished writing the endpoint. It would be better if the embedded language detector could see that both `MapGet` overloads have the same string syntax and use it upfront.\r\n\r\ncc @CyrusNajmabadi ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/61982","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Embedded language detector and overloads\" (#61982)"},{"Id":"1274670107","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T07:23:26","Actor":"kelicto","Number":"61985","RawContent":null,"Title":"Inheriting multiple generic collections, LINQ extensions lose smart hints","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: \r\nVisual Studio 2019+\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\nPlease see code.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nPlease see code.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nPlease see code.\r\n\r\n**Reference Code**:\r\n``` C#\r\nvar test = new TestCollection();\r\n\r\n// The IDE is not able to prompt the object for the proper LINQ methods, you have to manually force the writing\r\ntest.Where<Dog>(w => w is null);\r\ntest.Where<Cat>(w => w is null);\r\n\r\npublic class TestCollection : IEnumerable<Dog>, IEnumerable<Cat>\r\n{\r\n\tIEnumerator<Cat> IEnumerable<Cat>.GetEnumerator()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tthrow new NotImplementedException();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tIEnumerator<Dog> IEnumerable<Dog>.GetEnumerator()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tthrow new NotImplementedException();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tIEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tthrow new NotImplementedException();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Dog\r\n{\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Cat\r\n{\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/61985","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Inheriting multiple generic collections, LINQ extensions lose smart hints\" (#61985)"},{"Id":"1274605644","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T07:22:47","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"61983","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge main to main-vs-deps","State":"closed","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from main into main-vs-deps.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main-vs-deps\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

They represent two separate approachs to the design.\r\n- `CompletionService` provides the high-level interface on how users might interact with the service, but the service provider can decide for themself how do they want to implement it.\r\n- `CompletionServiceWithProviders` inherits from `CompletionService`, which additionally imposes a `CompletionProvider` based approach and handles all the provider related logic (including MEF import and NuGet extension points for the system). Services that implement `CompletionServiceWithProviders` therefore can break things down to individual providers. Roslyn languages are using this type.\r\n\r\nWe recently decided to rescind the support for completion of arbitrary languages and [made CompletionService and CompletionServiceWithProviders non-inheritable in 4.1](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/Breaking%20API%20Changes.md#version-410). And all our existing 2nd party partners (F# and TypeScript) are using the `CompletionServiceWithProviders` based approach (via ExternalAccess pattern) which effectively renders the existing two-layer design obsolete. As a result, we'd like to merge `CompletionServiceWithProviders` into `CompletionService` to simplify the codebase.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n```diff\r\n-public abstract class CompletionServiceWithProviders : CompletionService\r\n-{\r\n-    public override CompletionRules Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Completion.CompletionService.GetRules()\r\n-    public override sealed bool ShouldTriggerCompletion(SourceText text, int caretPosition, CompletionTrigger trigger, ImmutableHashSet<string> roles = null, OptionSet options = null)\r\n-    public override Task<CompletionList>GetCompletionsAsync(Document document, int caretPosition, CompletionTrigger trigger = default(Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Completion.CompletionTrigger), ImmutableHashSet<string> roles = null, OptionSet options = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\r\n-    public override Task<CompletionChange> GetChangeAsync(Document document, CompletionItem item, char? commitKey, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n- }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\npublic abstract class CompletionService\r\n{\r\n-    public virtual CompletionRules Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Completion.CompletionService.GetRules()\r\n+    public CompletionRules Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Completion.CompletionService.GetRules() \r\n\r\n-    public virtual bool ShouldTriggerCompletion(SourceText text, int caretPosition, CompletionTrigger trigger, ImmutableHashSet<string> roles = null, OptionSet options = null)\r\n+    public bool ShouldTriggerCompletion(SourceText text, int caretPosition, CompletionTrigger trigger, ImmutableHashSet<string> roles = null, OptionSet options = null)\r\n\r\n-    public abstract Task<CompletionList>GetCompletionsAsync(Document document, int caretPosition, CompletionTrigger trigger = default(Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Completion.CompletionTrigger), ImmutableHashSet<string> roles = null, OptionSet options = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\r\n+    public Task<CompletionList>GetCompletionsAsync(Document document, int caretPosition, CompletionTrigger trigger = default(Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Completion.CompletionTrigger), ImmutableHashSet<string> roles = null, OptionSet options = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method is currently overridden by TypeScript, I have added internal API for them as part of this PR so we can move them off the public API in the future so we could make this additional change:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\npublic abstract class CompletionService\r\n{\r\n-    public virtual public virtual ImmutableArray<CompletionItem> FilterItems(Document document, ImmutableArray<CompletionItem> items, string filterText)\r\n+    public ImmutableArray<CompletionItem> FilterItems(Document document, ImmutableArray<CompletionItem> items, string filterText)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nN/A. No new API in this proposal\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nN/A. No new APIs in this proposal\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nRemoving `virtual` modifier from methods of publicly non-inheritable `CompletionService` isn't a breaking change. And we don't find any direct reference to `CompletionServiceWithProviders` outside Roslyn, so we feel it's safe to remove the type instead of making it obsolete.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/61977","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Merge CompletionServiceWithProviders into CompletionService\" (#61977)"},{"Id":"1274259102","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-17T00:08:56","Actor":"genlu","Number":"61976","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix project based CompletionProvider","State":"open","Body":"Fix #61950 and #46803. \r\n\r\nMajority of the change in this PR are from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/61943, I based this PR on that branch in order to minimize future merge conflicts.

It's just a LOT of packages on NuGet - any time we need to do anything like delist a series, publish, etc, it's just a more expensive operation, and I'm sure NuGet wouldn't be sad if we didn't have so many packages being published.\r\n2. Install time is greater, it's just more packages and msi's to process\r\n3. Cognitive load is higher in terms of understanding what these things are, debugging issues, and overall complexity this creates for users and troubleshooting. It might look the same after install but it makes it much harder for users to conceptually understand how things fit together and where they come from.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI know pack groups are in the works, and this should at least reduce the number of .msi's produced which is a great improvement, but I think it is still worth solving for at least a couple of the aforementioned reasons.\r\n\r\nIdeally, a single nuget package for each of these three areas (Controls.Runtime, Controls.Ref, Core.Runtime, Core.Ref, Essentials.Runtime, Essentials.Ref) could support all of the target platforms within it.\r\n\r\nEven better would be the ability to have Ref/Runtime in the same pack as well.\r\n\r\nIn our packs, we already use `ref`, `libs`, and `runtimes` folders with TFM subfolders just like a normal nuget (ie: `ref/net6.0-android31.0`), however it seems there's no metadata in the `data/FrameworkList.xml` file to specify the target platforms for these files.  Perhaps this file format could be enhanced to support this.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI think the original intent here was to ship smaller individual packages to save on installation size for when you don't need to pull down all of the different target platforms.  This is still potentially true in some cases, however for MAUI's 3 sets of ref/runtime packs, we're talking around **47mb** for _all_ target platforms for Core/Controls/Essentials combined.  We _could_ keep split this up but I suspect the savings are minimal and most people will opt for enough platforms for diminishing returns here.  Currently we don't support picking individual platforms at acquisition time anyway.\r\n\r\nInterestingly Android is actually impacted negatively by this currently.  Take for instance their API 32 runtime packs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.Android.Runtime.32.android-arm\r\nMicrosoft.Android.Runtime.32.android-arm64\r\nMicrosoft.Android.Runtime.32.android-x64\r\nMicrosoft.Android.Runtime.32.android-x86\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile there are some binaries that are specific to each of these architectures, they are < 1MB per architecture.  On the other hand, this structure (and maybe there's a better way to do this?) currently means we are duplicating the managed binaries which do not differ at all between these platforms for each, and _those_ happen to be **45MB**, so we have an extra **135MB** of otherwise unnecessary binaries here.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/26069","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow Runtime/Ref packs to contain multiple Target Platforms\" (#26069)"},{"Id":"1274213025","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-16T23:33:37","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"26068","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/6.0.4xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/fsharp","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:6f9d3f7b-02f1-4f11-cfa1-08da18137649)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp\r\n- **Subscription**: 6f9d3f7b-02f1-4f11-cfa1-08da18137649\r\n- **Build**: 20220617.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: June 17, 2022 8:25:10 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: a4917f01c6abd83acce4b3b9ad25fff43ef4ed3f\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/dev17.3\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

These packages will be maintained by the .NET team and kept up to date as part of each servicing release for each of the supported .NET versions.\r\n\r\nThese are the package identifiers of the new set of packages to be added:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.Preview\r\n\r\n## Implementation Timeline\r\n\r\n1. Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available.

As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered. Please see the [.NET Package Deprecation list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/net-package-deprecation.md) and use issue https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7420 to comment.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/217","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)\" (#217)"},{"Id":"1203587106","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T17:28:33","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"216","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking Change: Revert the Console Formatter Default in .NET 6 Container Images","State":"open","Body":"In the .NET 6 `aspnet` container images we made the decision to default the console logger in `CreateDefaultBuilder()` to structured JSON logs in order to support container environments where folks use tools like fluentd or Azure Monitor to collect those logs. However, this resulted in non-human readable output that does not work well when viewing this output to analyze logs. [Please see this issue for more details](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/2725).

This means [.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. If your application uses NET Core 2.1, we strongly recommend you migrate your application to a supported version – .NET Core 3.1 or later.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) was shipped in May 30, 2018 and was declared an LTS release with the 2.1.3 update in August 2018. The 3-year lifecycle for the 2.1 release has come to an end on August 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.1 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.1 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.1, will be accessible through the [.NET Downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) page. \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.1 has reached end of life\" (#199)"},{"Id":"974082248","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-08-18T21:49:10","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Main is now targeting .NET 7","State":"open","Body":"This is a heads up that the primary repos of the stack have branched for .NET 6 GA/servicing/RCs, and that the `main` branch for those repos has become .NET 7.\r\n\r\n## Anything special to note about .NET 7?\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between .NET 6 and .NET 7 flow is that the SDK repos will have their own channel (.NET 7.0.1xx SDK) from the very beginning.

If you have installed .NET Core 2.1.29 previously you need to install the .NET Core 2.1.30 update in order to be fully protected.\r\n\r\n_Note: .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5.0 August updates are not affected and therefore not being re-released._\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer | 2.1.2 or lower | 2.1.30 \r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer | 3.1.17 or lower | 3.1.18 \r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer | 5.0.8 or lower  | 5.0.9 \r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1 or .NET Core 2.1. If you have installed one or more .NET Core SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET Core SDKs.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You should see an output like the following:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n* If you're using .NET 5.0, you should download and install Runtime 5.0.9 or SDK 5.0.206 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.8) or SDK 5.0.303 (for Visual Studio 2019 V16.10) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5.0.\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.18 or SDK 3.1.118 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.412 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.7 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET Core 2.1, you should download and install Runtime 2.1.30 or SDK 2.1.526 (for Visual Studio 2019 v15.9) or 2.1.818 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n\r\nIf your application is using .NET Core 2.1 running on .NET Framework see the [Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework](#updating-2.1) section below.\r\n\r\n.NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1 and .NET Core 2.1 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"updating-2.1\"></a> Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework\r\nIf you are running .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework you need to check your projects for dependencies and update them accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\n* If your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 2.1 incrementally. This means that users who reference the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` package must add a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\n* The shared framework for .NET Core 3.1 and later does not include `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.dll`. Users targeting netcoreapp3.1 or later must also update their `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package version.\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 3.1 and later completely. This means users who reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` can bump that version to 2.1.30. They don't need a new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` reference.\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core or .NET 5, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

This results in missing debug information when stepping through code.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **Added `SimpleSequencePointInjector`** in `MethodCompiler.cs` that wraps non-compiler-generated statements with `BoundSequencePoint` nodes\n- **Applied instrumentation** before `RuntimeAsyncRewriter` when `IsRuntimeAsyncEnabledIn(method)` returns true\n- **Added tests** (`RuntimeAsyncLocalFunction` and `RuntimeAsyncLambda`) to validate sequence point generation\n\n## Current Status\n\nSequence points are now being generated, but point to incorrect source locations. The issue stems from `ClosureConversion` producing rewritten bodies where statement `.Syntax` properties no longer reference the expected source code positions.\n\n### Example\n\n```csharp\nstatic async Task M()\n{\n    async Task Inner()\n    {\n        await Task.Delay(1);           // Should have sequence point\n        Console.WriteLine(\"hello\");    // Should have sequence point\n    }\n    await Inner();\n}\n```\n\n**Before**: No sequence points generated for `Inner()` body  \n**After**: Sequence points generated but mapped to wrong lines (needs investigation into syntax node preservation through closure conversion)\n\n## Further Work Needed\n\nThe root cause is that after `ClosureConversion`, the bound tree statements retain syntax nodes that don't correspond to the local function/lambda body. Alternative approaches to investigate:\n\n1. Apply `LocalRewriter.Rewrite()` to lambda/local function bodies before closure conversion\n2. Fix syntax node associations in rewritten bodies\n3.

I have noticed this a couple times recently. However, I was writing a skill that uses a tool and wanted to use `dnx`. However, using `dnx` is challenging. We need good guidance for this and to consider product changes. For now I'm saying, always use `dnx -y dotnet-inspect -- [args]`.\n\nThere are two cases where an LLM might hit an interactive prompt:\n\n- First install\n- New version available\n\nThe second point is the most challenging. A session could be moving forward using a tool and then a new version is published to nuget.org, `dnx` notices this, and then blocks the LLM (or other tool) with an interactive prompt. This also means that `dnx` isn't a great choice for scripts, as-is.\n\nHere's what I see.\n\nDNX:\n\n<img width=\"1056\" height=\"232\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bea437fd-8ca2-440c-936f-31d70efd2d38\" />\n\nNPM:\n\n<img width=\"1056\" height=\"232\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb310871-3a4e-4290-9ae2-72fab8af1c8a\" />\n\nThis is from `npm exec help`:\n\n>       If any requested packages are not present in the local project\n>       dependencies, then a prompt is printed, which can be suppressed by\n>       providing either --yes or --no. When standard input is not a TTY or a CI\n>       environment is detected, --yes is assumed. The requested packages are\n>       installed to a folder in the npm cache, which is added to the PATH\n>       environment variable in the executed process.\n\nI asked Copilot to thoroughly test this:\n\n<img width=\"1167\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d5e6e5e-e381-42fc-afe7-659d593dbc74\" />\n\nI don't think that stdin is excellent solution. It's a pattern to enable. I'd like to see the dnx offer the same model as npx and also offer an ENV variable to make a whole session safe. That would mean install the package if not available and DON'T install a new package if one is available unless asked to.\n\nSide note: We should make it easy to clear the dnx cache. This made testing a bit awkward.\n\nI sometimes see the first-run experience in CP-CLI/CC. This is harmful, in the sense that it is wasted tokens and the person we wanted to see the first-run experience doesn't. Assuming we a `DOTNET_INTERACTIVE=false`, then I'd skip the first-run message as well. There may be other experiences we need to consider. That's why the title is about the scenario not dnx in particular.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52759","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable first-class non-interactive mode for the CLI\" (#52759)"},{"Id":"3877668927","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-30T22:38:24","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"52758","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port workload corruption repair to main from release/10.0.2xx","State":"open","Body":"Ports PR #52700 (backport of #52434) from release/10.0.2xx to main, enabling `workload repair` to recover from corrupt workload sets where package managers have removed manifest files.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- **WorkloadManifestCorruptionRepairer**: New component that detects missing manifests in workload sets and reinstalls them via transaction\n- **WorkloadInstallerFactory**: Now initializes corruption repairer and attaches to manifest provider before operations\n- **SdkDirectoryWorkloadManifestProvider**: Added `HasMissingManifests()` to detect corruption, throws descriptive error when manifests missing outside repair context\n- **ManifestCorruptionFailureMode**: Controls behavior on detection (throw vs repair)\n\n## Code clarity improvements\n\nIncludes copilot review suggestions from #52700:\n- Explicit null check: `provider == null || !provider.HasMissingManifests(workloadSet)` replaces nullable operator pattern\n- Removed unused import in test mock\n\n## Test coverage\n\n- `GivenMissingManifestsInWorkloadSetModeRepairReinstallsManifests`: Validates repair command reinstalls missing manifests\n- `GivenMissingManifestsInWorkloadSetModeUpdateReinstallsManifests`: Validates update command triggers repair\n- `CorruptWorkloadSetTestHelper`: Test infrastructure for simulating corruption scenarios\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for details)</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/sdk/pulls/52700/commits`\n>   - Triggering command: `/usr/bin/curl curl -s REDACTED` (http block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to the custom allowlist in this repository's [Copilot coding agent settings](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/settings/copilot/coding_agent) (admins only)\n>\n> </details>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52758","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Port workload corruption repair to main from release/10.0.2xx\" (#52758)"},{"Id":"3877644094","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-30T22:30:53","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"52757","RawContent":null,"Title":"Refactor: Replace `_testAssetsManager` field with `TestAssetsManager` property in `SdkTest`","State":"open","Body":"Converts the protected field `_testAssetsManager` in `SdkTest` to a get-only property `TestAssetsManager`, following C# naming conventions and property-based encapsulation patterns.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **`SdkTest.cs`**: Replaced field with get-only auto-property, positioned after `Log` property\n- **302 test files**: Updated all references from `_testAssetsManager` to `TestAssetsManager`\n\n```csharp\n// Before\nprotected TestAssetsManager _testAssetsManager;\n\nprotected SdkTest(ITestOutputHelper log)\n{\n    Log = log;\n    _testAssetsManager = new TestAssetsManager(log);\n}\n\n// After\nprotected ITestOutputHelper Log { get;

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

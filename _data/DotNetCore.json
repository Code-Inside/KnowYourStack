The implicit ref prevents this or other processes from attempting to destroy the mutex while it is locked. The implicit ref is removed in either of these cases:\r\n      - The mutex gets another reference from within the same process\r\n      - The thread that owns the lock exits and abandons the mutex, at which point that would be the last reference to the mutex and the process would not reference the mutex anymore\r\n  - The implementation based on file locks is less restricted, but for consistency that implementation also follows the same behavior\r\n- There was also a race between an exiting thread abandoning one of its locked named mutexes and another thread releasing the last reference to it, fixed by using the creation/deletion process lock to synchronize\r\n\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34271 in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- Random crashes were seen on Unixes\r\n- When a named mutex is locked and the last reference to it is released from a different thread in any process, the underlying pthread mutex object is destroyed and that has undefined behavior. Crashes were seen where some data associated with the destroyed pthread mutex continues to be used when acquiring another pthread mutex in racy situations, causing a crash because the memory containing the destroyed pthread mutex is unmapped.\r\n- There was also a race where a thread has acquired the lock of a named mutex, between that thread exiting and abandoning the mutex, and another thread attempting to destroy the mutex\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- PAL named mutex tests on Linux and OSX including in stress mode (1 hour) in debug and release\r\n- System.Threading tests including mutex tests on Linux and OSX with debug and release coreclr\r\n- PAL, coreclr, and libraries tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- It is a bit of a corner case, where a lock is acquired and the mutex is disposed without releasing the lock, especially necessary for this issue is that the thread that disposes the mutex is different from the one that holds the lock\r\n- Since the fix involves extending the lifetime of a mutex in such a case, the underlying shared named mutex may observably live longer than before. That is necessary for correctness, as the behavior there was incorrect before and leading to the crashes."},{"Id":"14445093397","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-07T22:20:28","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28116","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update BuildTools to rc1-05907-02 (release/2.1)\" (#28116) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"/cc @dotnet/maestro-reviewers-core"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[{"Id":"14576478503","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-17T23:34:37","Actor":"cristianosuzuki77","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13658","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[Loc] Few updates to translations\" (#13658) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"I'm your MSFT Loc PM.

master-vs-deps.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/release/dev16.9-vs-deps\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/master-vs-deps\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch. Generally the author whose change introduced the conflicts should pull down this PR, fix the conflicts locally, then push up a commit resolving the conflicts.\n\n### Resolve merge conflicts using your local repo\nSometimes merge conflicts may be present on GitHub but merging locally will work without conflicts. This is due to differences between the merge algorithm used in local git versus the one used by GitHub.\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/release/dev16.9-vs-deps-to-master-vs-deps\ngit reset --hard upstream/master-vs-deps\ngit merge upstream/release/dev16.9-vs-deps\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/release/dev16.9-vs-deps-to-master-vs-deps

potential race in iterating counters","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\nThere was a mistake that was made in backporting https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40259 to https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28089 where `_counters` was used to iterate instead of the snapshotted value of `counters`. `_counters` is a list that needs to be lock-protected, but this access was happening outside of the lock, which is what the snapshot is for. This caused a race-condition on the read/write on this list, causing a crash. The problem does not exist in the 5.0 fix, only for the 3.1 backport. \r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMedium/High. When hit with this issue, a customer may experience a crash. A customer may run into this issue when they turn on the runtime counters (System.Runtime) or any other set of counter providers, and then modify the list of counters while a counter callback is happening by either creating or disposing instances of EventCounters. For customers that don't consume/create their own EventCounters, this shouldn't be a problem. For those who do, it's pretty easy to hit with the likelihood increasing the shorter they set the counter polling interval.\r\n\r\n## Regression \r\n\r\nYes. From 3.1.8 -> 3.1.9 servicing release. \r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n\r\nWe do not have a local repro of this failure, but we tested the fix by providing a custom build of the runtime with this fix to the  internal partner test that initially reported this problem. They ran it in production that hit this issue and reported that this addresses the issue.\r\n\r\n## Risk \r\n\r\nThe root cause/fix is well-understood and the fix was verified through partner testing - I would say it is relatively low.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28112","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix a potential race in iterating counters\" (#28112)"},{"Id":"709001291","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-16T16:15:41","Actor":"mlindstr","Number":"28104","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix ilasm managed resource lookup on Linux.","State":"closed","Body":"ILAsm did not properly find managed resources if they were not in the\r\nworking directory of ILAsm itself.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

The modified code was identical to the code in 5.0.\r\n\r\nThe customer that reported the issue for 3.1 verified this code fix with a private DLL sent to them, and verified the exception is now being thrown as expected:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42360#issuecomment-694545520\r\n\r\nThe customer also verified the behavior in 5.0 and confirmed that their issue is gone in that version, which justifies the backport: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42360#issuecomment-693791617\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42988","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] [corefx] Fix FileStream.Dispose silently fails on Dispose when disk has run out of space\" (#42988)"},{"Id":"704997021","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-22T16:45:20","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"42990","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr\r\n- **Subscription**: dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5\r\n- **Build**: 20200919.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/19/2020 8:23 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 3fbe13469a10dca70e50f7cb8507e348b9095563\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk.IL**: [from 3.1.9-servicing.20466.1 to 3.1.9-servicing.20469.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm**: [from 3.1.9-servicing.20466.1 to 3.1.9-servicing.20469.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.CoreCLR**: [from 3.1.9-servicing.20466.1 to 3.1.9-servicing.20469.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/compare/dd56afa...3fbe134\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42990","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr\" (#42990)"},{"Id":"705711038","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-21T15:41:37","Actor":"silvioguiso","Number":"42991","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixes build-tools","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42991","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fixes build-tools\" (#42991)"},{"Id":"704005336","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-18T23:01:25","Actor":"carlossanlop","Number":"42989","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix Windows AccessViolationException in FileSystemWatcher when monitoring network share for changes","State":"closed","Body":"## Customer impact\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported for 3.1 twice:\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/40412 - w3wp.exe crash in FileSystemWatcher after 2.2 -> 3.1 migration (c0000005 Access Violation)\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42108 - FileSystemWatcher crash UNALIGNED_STACK_POINTER\r\n\r\nWhen monitoring a network share with `FileSystemWatcher`, if there are network issues that could cause the data to arrive malformed, then after casting the byte array to a `FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION`, attempts to access the struct fields can throw an AV.\r\n\r\nThe 6.0 (master) PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/42419\r\nThe 5.0 backport PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/42420\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe issue was also reported internally by one of the customers.

This feature itself is enormously complex and has been a very large source of errors for the IDE.  Looking just at issues with a false IDE0004 reported, we have more than 60 (and that doesn't count bug reports where the user doesn't mention the specific IDE error code).\r\n\r\nThe code has always been problematic (especially as it is written as a blacklist instead of a whitelist).  This causes us to often aggressively assume a cast is safe to remove, which can have disastrous implications for a program.  It is also extremely hard to maintain as the compiler/lang adds more advanced features in this area.  In particular, both conditional expressions and target typing have proven to cause huge amount of headaches here as hte IDE attempts to bring our analyzer up to snuff with those advanced, often non-local, lang features.  I'm fairly certain that even with all our patches that we've put in so far, we still likely have dozens of issues with the language rior to C#9 and likely dozens introduced post that.\r\n\r\nFrom talking with @333fred we have a supposition that this feature would be a lot simpler, and saner, if placed into the compiler itself.  Similar to the `Remove unused usings` analysis that was done years ago, we can leverage the compiler's rich understanding of the code (including a *complete* bound semantic tree) to do a much more precise and accurate assessment of if a cast is unnecessary.  The compiler would then just issue a hidden diagnostic which the IDE layer would light up on to both fade out hte cast, and offer the fix.  (Or, there could literally be a 'IsCastUnnecessary' helper on SemanticModel).\r\n\r\nWhile this is likely a very facile analysis, we think the general idea would be to effectively examine the before and after bound trees for a cast (i.e. one with the cast in it, and one with it not there).  The compiler would then whitelist tree changes which were proven to be non-impactful.  For example, given:\r\n\r\n`object o = (object)someString;`\r\n\r\nthis cast would be unnecessary as the trees before and after would effectively be the same (with an implicitly written implicit-reference conversion, versus an explicit one).\r\n\r\nNote though that the cases can get very complex as the presence of conversions can affect many parts of compiler analysis (for example, overload resolution).  However, this complexity is precisely why IDE would prefer that this be in the compiler, as otherwise the same analysis that the compiler normally does now needs to be redone (often poorly) at our layer.\r\n\r\nThere is no great rush on this.  But it would be very nice to be able to have this be done.  Esp. if there are interested compiler devs willing to at least explore this idea and measure the viability of it.  Fortunately, the IDE has a large amount of tests (roughly 600+ in this area) documenting many of complex cases that we've often been tripped up by.    The tests are split into two test suites:\r\n\r\nRemoveUnnecessaryCastTests and\r\nCastSimplificationTests\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/50043","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Explore having the compiler itself issue a diagnostic for unnecessary casts.\" (#50043)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CoreRT-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"705078013","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-01T06:31:20","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8345","RawContent":null,"Title":"ARM64&Unix: New unwinder","State":"closed","Body":"Implements a custom unwinder for ARM64 that does not need the generic CFI based libunwind functions.

proposal","State":"open","Body":"# CLI Up To Date Check\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nThis document outlines a new .NET CLI command for checking that a user's toolset is up to date. This command will notify users if any updated versions of the SDK, runtime, or workloads exist and are avaliable for installation.\r\n\r\nIn future releases we may consider expanding this feature to gather updated release information in the background and notify users of updates more frequently. However, for .NET 6 we will only run the up to date check on an explicit user gesture, i.e. a new CLI command.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Overview\r\n\r\n### Gather Updated Product Information\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft.Deployment.Dotnet.Releases API can be referenced via a nuget package reference and provides methods for gathering all current released product information. Calling this API will provide up to date product data including the latest released SDK and runtime versions for each channel (or major.minor version) and the current support phase (for example, preview or end of life).\r\n\r\nNote that this involves fetching the release.json file from the internet, meaning this command will not be supported in offline scenarios. We will need to ensure that the error experience makes this clear to the user.\r\n\r\nAs this network call is not on a critical path, we will not retry on failure. If we find that this approach causes frequent failures after the first iteration of the feature, we will work on improving back end reliability and/or integrate retries at that time.\r\n\r\n### Determine Installed SDKs and Runtimes\r\n\r\nWe will use the same mechanism for determining installed SDKs and runtimes as the `dotnet --info` command, as differing information on installed SDKs between these two commands would be confusing for users. As a result we will use APIs provided by host fxr to determine what SDKs and runtimes are installed. \r\n\r\nAs the current implementation of the `dotnet --info` command determines installed bundles based only on directories being present, it is possible for it to wrongly report that a bundle exists. We will mitigate this issue by adding some further sanity checking to ensure that a given bundle is present, for example, by ensuring that the bundle's directory is not empty.\r\n\r\n### Select Relevant Product Information\r\n\r\nAs the releases API provides all product information, we will need to filter this down to data relevant to the user. That is, we only need to calculate and display the following:\r\n\r\n#### Most Recent Patch Version of Installed SDKs and Standalone Runtimes\r\n\r\nFor each installed SDK or runtime we will find the appropriate major.minor channel (for example, 5.0). Each channel has associated data on the lastest released SDK and runtime, which we can compare to the current version to determine if we need to notify the user that they are out of date.\r\n\r\n#### New Major.Minor or Feature Band SDK Versions\r\n\r\nWe will select the latest channel and the latest SDK associated with that channel. We can advertise a new SDK version to the user if we find that any of the major, minor, or feature band version numbers are greater than that of the current SDK. \r\n\r\n#### Warning for EOL Support Phase\r\n\r\nWe can determine if a SDK is still in support by checking the `SupportPhase` property within the appropriate version channel. If the SDK is end of life or in maintenance mode (meaning it will go out of support within the next 3 months) we will print a warning to the user recommending that they update.\r\n\r\n#### Most Recent Workload Versions\r\n\r\nAs with SDKs and runtimes, we want to be able to notify a user of available updates for their installed workloads. The vast majority of this work will be covered by the workloads update spec and we will leverage that result to determine which workloads are installed and their most recent versions.\r\n\r\n### Display command output\r\n\r\nOnce we have calculated the relevant information we can simply format it and write it to console output. \r\n\r\n## Outstanding questions\r\n\r\n- Workload update check details. These will be outlined in @dsplaisted's workloads spec","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/15021","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Up to date check proposal\" (#15021)"},{"Id":"769999624","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-17T20:05:28","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"15014","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8\r\n- **Build**: 20201215.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: 12/15/2020 8:39 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 7d638bb082f374f7c8ddbada79f757662df4a246\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 6.0.0-beta.20614.8 to 6.0.0-beta.20615.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions**: [from 6.0.0-beta.20614.8 to 6.0.0-beta.20615.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 6.0.0-beta.20614.8 to 6.0.0-beta.20615.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool**: [from 6.0.0-beta.20614.8 to 6.0.0-beta.20615.4][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/b2d5bf0...7d638bb\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/15014","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#15014)"},{"Id":"770283371","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-17T18:47:02","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"15020","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/fsharp","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:42347601-5838-4322-3219-08d8080363b6)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp\r\n- **Subscription**: 42347601-5838-4322-3219-08d8080363b6\r\n- **Build**: 20201216.7\r\n- **Date Produced**: 12/17/2020 4:00 AM\r\n- **Commit**: b3d8fdb5a1baa957b80ed2739de0346740f5a948\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/dev16.9\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.FSharp.Compiler**: [from 11.0.1-beta.20562.2 to 11.0.0-beta.20616.7][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/compare/7fd0736...b3d8fdb\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:42347601-5838-4322-3219-08d8080363b6)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/15020","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/fsharp\" (#15020)"},{"Id":"770189430","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-17T18:28:39","Actor":"akoeplinger","Number":"15017","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix test directory clash between two tests with the same name","State":"closed","Body":"Since both tests were called `It_warns_when_targetting_netcoreapp_2_x()` we generated the same path to the test project: `It_warns_when---89ACFD43/ConsoleApp/ConsoleApp.csproj`\r\n\r\nIf these two tests execute at roughly the same time (which can happen randomly with xunit's parallelization) then we'd run into weird issues where files are missing since one of the two tests deleted them:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4019: The imported project \"/datadisks/disk1/work/A11D08D5/w/B2BB092B/e/testExecutionDirectory/It_warns_when---89ACFD43/ConsoleApp/obj/ConsoleApp.csproj.*.targets\" was not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaking the test names unique will avoid this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: I saw more instance of the same path/hash being used for multiple test runs but those were different runs of the same `[Theory]` and xunit doesn't parallelize those.

The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

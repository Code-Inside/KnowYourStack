The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

Overall, if a consumer class's namespace has the same prefix as a namespace it is using and the using are within the namespace block, then the build fails.\r\n\r\ne.g. build passes\r\n```\r\nnamespace NameSpaceIssueCheck;\r\n\r\nusing ABC.DEF.Lib1;\r\nusing DEF.Lib1;\r\n\r\ninternal class Class1\r\n{\r\n    public string GetMessage()\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(new Class2().GetMessage());\r\n        Console.WriteLine(new Class3().GetMessage());\r\n\r\n        return \"hello from class A\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbuild fails\r\n```\r\nnamespace ABC.NameSpaceIssueCheck;\r\n\r\nusing ABC.DEF.Lib1;\r\nusing DEF.Lib1;\r\n\r\ninternal class Class1\r\n{\r\n    public string GetMessage()\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(new Class2().GetMessage());\r\n        Console.WriteLine(new Class3().GetMessage());\r\n\r\n        return \"hello from class A\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that the only difference between these two files is `namespace NameSpaceIssueCheck;` vs `namespace ABC.NameSpaceIssueCheck;`.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nWe ❤ code! Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a GitHub repo, Gist snippet, or other means to see the isolated behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe may close this issue if:\r\n- The repro project you share with us is complex.

[C:\\dotnet-namespace-issue\\BuildFails\\NameSpaceIssueCheck.csproj]\r\n```\r\n- Run the scenario where build works, the consumer class has the same namespace prefix `ABC` as compared to the ones it is referencing and the using are outside of the namespace block (refer [Class1.cs](https://github.com/realrubberduckdev/dotnet-namespace-issue/blob/194bd2be412f960dfa5b4bbd79368cf5cd6b81f3/BuildWorksUsingsOutsideNamespace/Class1.cs#L1))\r\n```\r\ncd BuildWorksUsingsOutsideNamespace\r\ndotnet build .\\NameSpaceIssueCheck.csproj\r\n```\r\nWhy does the build fail in the case when using statements are inside the namespace?

Used the script that looks for msi references in the registry and uses powershell to uninstall those.\r\n\r\nThen I reinstalled Visual Studio 2022, selecting the .Net Maui work load.

If NuGet outputs warnings that are only applicable to a subset of the `TargetFrameworks`, when I open the project in Visual Studio, I see the same message replayed once per project TFM, even if NuGet's message doesn't apply to all of the project TFMs.\r\n\r\nApproximate code area: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs#L1238\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>net6.0;net8.0;netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup Condition=\" '$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0' \">\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"12.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn VS's error list, I see the NU1603 warning about 13.0.0 not found, so using 13.0.1 instead message 3 times, even though only 1 of the 3 project TFMs actually references the package. Changing the number of TFMs targeted changes the number of times the message is displayed.\r\n\r\nLooking at `obj/project.assets.json`, the final `logs` section lists `NU1603` once, with property `\"targetGraphs\": [ \"net6.0\" ]`, so the information is there.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n\r\n.NET SDK 8.0 preview that's inserted into VS 17.8 internal preview.\r\n\r\nAlso note that there are additional complications with TFMs earlier than `net5.0`. NuGet's `targetGraph` within the `logs` section lists the \"full\" TFM, for example \".NETStandard,Version=v2.0\". The assets file's `targets` section also uses the \"full TFM\", so will also say `.NETStandard,Version=v2.0`. However, `$.project.frameworks` uses `netstandard2.0` and the `targetAlias` is obviously also `netstandard2.0`, since that's what's written in the csproj.  I'm not sure if the \"inconsistent\" format makes it hard to match the `logs`' `targetGraphs` to the TFM that's currently being considered.\r\n\r\nAlthough, I think it would be better from a customer point of view if the log messages were de-duplicated, because a single message appearing in multiple `targetGraphs` isn't particularly interesting to customers to be displayed multiple times.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/34547","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TFM specific NuGet warnings/errors are displayed for TFMs that they don't apply to in VS\" (#34547)"},{"Id":"1843116929","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-09T12:17:47","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"34538","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:Coherency Updates)\r\n## Coherency Updates\r\n\r\nThe following updates ensure that dependencies with a *CoherentParentDependency*\r\nattribute were produced in a build used as input to the parent dependency's build.\r\nSee [Dependency Description Format](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/DependencyDescriptionFormat.md#dependency-description-overview)\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Coherency Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XliffTasks**: from 1.0.0-beta.23381.1 to 1.0.0-beta.23407.1 (parent: Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk)\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:Coherency Updates)\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:3d9043af-0e17-4eb5-f3e3-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 3d9043af-0e17-4eb5-f3e3-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 20230808.6\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 8, 2023 11:04:51 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 5cd8dc258e8177b8542adf7abe45e7cfc1c1b1c0\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 8.0.0-beta.23407.1 to 8.0.0-beta.23408.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 8.0.0-beta.23407.1 to 8.0.0-beta.23408.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool**: [from 8.0.0-beta.23407.1 to 8.0.0-beta.23408.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions**: [from 8.0.0-beta.23407.1 to 8.0.0-beta.23408.6][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XliffTasks**: [from 1.0.0-beta.23381.1 to 1.0.0-beta.23407.1][2]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/9a7b1d30fd...5cd8dc258e\r\n[2]: https://github.com/dotnet/xliff-tasks/compare/d3553ca27f...185f62b89a\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n- **Updates to .NET SDKs:**\r\n  - Updates tools.dotnet to 8.0.100-preview.7.23376.3\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:3d9043af-0e17-4eb5-f3e3-08d8e97c775d)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/34538","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#34538)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1841710892","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-08T17:19:58","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"269","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-38180: .NET Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-38180: .NET Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core 2.1, .NET 6.0, and .NET 7.0.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-08-10T03:30:18.3246404Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":7972}

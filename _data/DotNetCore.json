Generally the author whose change introduced the conflicts should pull down this PR, fix the conflicts locally, then push up a commit resolving the conflicts.\n\n### Resolve merge conflicts using your local repo\nSometimes merge conflicts may be present on GitHub but merging locally will work without conflicts.

This is a release valve only intended for users who make heavy use of AssemblyLoadContext and are experiencing exceptions from this code path. It does not solve any of the issues that may arise from enabling this configuration.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThere is negligible risk involved with this change for most users. It is off-by-default and requires conscious action on the user's part to enable.\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, there _is_ a moderate amount of risk, as it is not a rigorously tested or previously supported scenario. Partner team validation and local testing of various scenarios showed that for specific use cases, it is sufficient.\r\n\r\nBelow is a collection of sample scenarios and the results of the traces when viewed in PerfView:\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with the _same_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: All events are received and correctly parsed\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with _different_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(int foo = 1) => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(string foo = \"foo\") => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: The last manifest received by PerfView is the one that gets used, so the `int` version of `MyEvent` gets parsed as the `string` version.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler on UWP definitely did support Digest up until about a week ago.\r\n\r\nMy appxbundle was built with Target version 10.0.17134, Min version 10.0.15063.\r\n\r\nI also tested with the latest & the problem still persists; Target version 10.0.18362, Min version 10.0.18362.\r\n\r\nDOES NOT WORK\r\n-------------------\r\nUWP on Windows 10 Pro 2004 19041.508\r\n\r\nWORKS\r\n--------\r\nUWP on Windows 10 Mobile 1709 10.0.15254.556\r\n.NET Framework 4.8 on Windows 10 Pro 2004 19041.508\r\nAndroid\r\niOS\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the return response I get:\r\n\r\n{StatusCode: 401, ReasonPhrase: 'Unauthorized', Version: 1.1, Content: System.Net.Http.StreamContent, Headers:\r\n{\r\n  Server: lighttpd/1.4.35\r\n  Date: Wed, 16 Sep 2020 03:38:24 GMT\r\n  WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm=\"iPolis_00:16:6C:7A:A3:80\", nonce=\"e2f7fe3344e6b521c2b83c56aa48fc17\", qop=\"auth\"\r\n  Content-Length: 351\r\n  Content-Type: text/html\r\n}}\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1774","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC\" (#1774)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CoreFx-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1170308034","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T21:59:36","Actor":"Mr-Tao","Number":"43138","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Add missing Oracle RIDs","State":"open","Body":"This change adds previously missing RIDs for OL releases 7, 8 and 9 and respective RHEL counterparts.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43138","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Add missing Oracle RIDs\" (#43138)"},{"Id":"1027406235","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T18:14:44","Actor":"ManickaP","Number":"43116","RawContent":null,"Title":"[H/2] Split lock to prevent deadlock in WindowUpdate processing","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220 also in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDeadlock in HTTP/2 - when a window update (WINDOW_UPDATE frame) is received at the same time as the HTTP/2 request is being completed.\r\nWe saw the very same problem in 5.0 in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220 (reported by customer) and fixed it in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769 for .NET 5.0.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in firstly locking connection sync object and then stream's (window update) while request completions attempts to lock stream and than connection.\r\n\r\nIn 5.0 (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769), we've split `Http2Stream` lock into 2 objects, one for the stream itself (used for completion etc.) and other for credit handling (window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\nIn 3.1, `Http2Stream` looks slightly different and uses credit manager's sync object as stream's sync object. So redefining stream's sync object to lock over `this` achieves the same thing as the fix in 5.0 since operations over `Http2Stream` are guarded with stream's lock and operations with credit lock credit manager itself (separate sync object for window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReliability problem.\r\nReported by customer using YARP. They are hitting it for specific backend server (likely due to timing). Temporary workaround is to disable HTTP/2 for the endpoint - such solution does not scale for larger number of backends and might not be acceptable for other backends.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\nLocal test run for 3.1.\r\nWhen we fixed the issue in 5.0, we got a confirmation from the reporting customer that the fix helped and that it didn't break anything.\r\nYARP customer needing the 3.1 fix is unable to verify the fix on unsigned binaries.\r\n\r\n### Link to PR / issue in main\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220\r\n6.0 (main) PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769\r\n5.0.5 servicing PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47921\r\n\r\n### Is there a packaging impact?\r\n\r\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43116","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[H/2] Split lock to prevent deadlock in WindowUpdate processing\" (#43116)"},{"Id":"1157840655","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T17:41:49","Actor":"carlossanlop","Number":"43135","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/65741\r\n\r\nI had to update some queues based on the [platforms supported for 3.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1-supported-os.md):\r\n  - Windows 19H1 to 20H2\r\n  - MacOS 1013 and 1014 to 1015 and 1100\r\n\r\nMade sure all the queue names matched something that existed here: https://helix.dot.net/\r\n\r\nThe sample run is here: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=1641884&view=results\r\n\r\nKudos to @hoyosjs for helping me find the right places to change.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43135","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal\" (#43135)"},{"Id":"1114496999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T23:53:09","Actor":"bartonjs","Number":"43132","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues","State":"closed","Body":"Backport https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/48460 to release/3.1 so the tests don't fail on Apple systems that no longer trust the relevant root authority.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43132","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues\" (#43132)"},{"Id":"1082811783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T02:39:11","Actor":"ayakael","Number":"43129","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1]Add RID for Alpine 3.15","State":"closed","Body":"Contributes to dotnet/core#6985\r\nI havn't seen this popup yet, so here is a merge request to add RID for Alpine 3.15.

However source generated documents are special and are not standard documents that we can look up in the solution by file path, so [this code](https://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.Protocol/Extensions/Extensions.cs,50) fails to find them.\r\n\r\nWe need to modify the document lookup and document tracking for source generated files so that we can find them when asked by the client.  Some notes\r\n1.  We can get the source generated document id from the temp file path using this API (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/373411ac6edfa011af9d8b69e925d783949c7e0d/src/VisualStudio/Core/Def/Workspace/SourceGeneratedFileManager.cs#L154) abstracted out into an interface we can get in LSP.\r\n2.  Workspace changes can cause source generated documents to be re-created, but the text buffer the LSP client has may not be up to date.  Normally this is handled by forking in LSP by retrieving the workspace doc and applying the LSP text on top (`document.WithText`).  However this API throws for source generated documents.  \r\n    1.  Instead what we need to do is freeze the source generated document with the contents from LSP.  \r\n    2.  The freezing must be done **on each request** as the freezing API (in its current form) expects to only be called for a source generated document _once_.  We cannot incrementally update the source generated documents in that frozen solution (normally we incrementally update LSP docs).  Therefore we must re-freeze every request by calling this API - https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/373411ac6edfa011af9d8b69e925d783949c7e0d/src/Workspaces/Core/Portable/Workspace/Solution/Solution.cs#L1751 whenever we get a request to lookup a source generated document.  \r\n\r\n### Longer term\r\n1.  We should consider updating the freezing API to allow incremental updates to the frozen solution so we can treat source generated documents the same as regular documents in LSP - incrementally update them in response to didChange requests.  Also requires 2).\r\n2.  We also need to make the API allow updating multiple source generated files in the same frozen snapshot.  Currently it only supports freezing a single source generated file.  This means if we have multiple source generated files open, the snapshot would only be frozen for the requested source generated file.  If something caused the contents of the second source generated file to change in the workspace but not on the client, we may produce invalid spans.\r\n    1.  Note this limitation exists already non-LSP VS in `GetOpenDocumentInCurrentContextWithChanges`.\r\n\r\nWe will have to be careful in scenarios where the source generated document moves workspaces (e.g. to misc), but this can happen to regular documents as well and _should_ be handled by the LspWorkspaceManager when it listens to workspace events\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/373411ac6edfa011af9d8b69e925d783949c7e0d/src/Features/LanguageServer/Protocol/Workspaces/LspWorkspaceManager.cs#L136\r\n\r\nAdditionally we will need to ensure that LSP virtual docs can handle these cases.  For example navigation responses should support sending back document versions for source generated URIs so that the client can ask the server for updated contents when it tries to navigate (if it doesn't have that version) - cc @NTaylorMullen \r\n\r\ncc @jasonmalinowski ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/60434","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[LSP] All requests for opened source generated documents fail\" (#60434)"},{"Id":"1184110687","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T23:32:59","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"60433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Test plan for UnsignedRightShift feature","State":"open","Body":"Feature branch - https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/tree/features/UnsignedRightShift\r\nSpecification - https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/unsigned-right-shift-operator.md\r\nProposal: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/4682","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/60433","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Test plan for UnsignedRightShift feature\" (#60433)"},{"Id":"1184110112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T23:32:06","Actor":"allisonchou","Number":"60432","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Versions.props and PublishData.json for 17.2 P3 snap","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60432","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update Versions.props and PublishData.json for 17.2 P3 snap\" (#60432)"},{"Id":"1184105395","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T23:24:47","Actor":"allisonchou","Number":"60431","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge release/dev17.3 to main-vs-deps","State":"open","Body":"Ideally https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60429 should merge before this does.\r\nAfter this, we should be able to delete release/dev17.3","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60431","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge release/dev17.3 to main-vs-deps\" (#60431)"},{"Id":"1184100481","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T23:17:45","Actor":"allisonchou","Number":"60430","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge main to release/dev17.2","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60430","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge main to release/dev17.2\" (#60430)"},{"Id":"1184098958","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T23:15:47","Actor":"allisonchou","Number":"60429","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge main-vs-deps to release/dev17.2","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60429","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge main-vs-deps to release/dev17.2\" (#60429)"},{"Id":"1184096321","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T23:13:01","Actor":"allisonchou","Number":"60428","RawContent":null,"Title":"Snap for 17.2 P3 (main-vs-deps -> release/dev17.2)","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60428","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Snap for 17.2 P3 (main-vs-deps -> release/dev17.2)\" (#60428)"},{"Id":"1184094294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T23:12:52","Actor":"allisonchou","Number":"60427","RawContent":null,"Title":"Snap for 17.2 P3 (main -> release/dev17.2)","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60427","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Snap for 17.2 P3 (main -> release/dev17.2)\" (#60427)"},{"Id":"1183550380","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T22:20:20","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"60420","RawContent":null,"Title":"Miscellaneous changes for Checked User-defined Operators feature","State":"closed","Body":"- Update Compiler Test Plan\r\n- Remove/address some PROTOTYPE comments\r\n- Add unit-tests","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60420","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Miscellaneous changes for Checked User-defined Operators feature\" (#60420)"},{"Id":"1183362441","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T21:35:05","Actor":"usr-sse2","Number":"60418","RawContent":null,"Title":"This code compiles in 3.x but doesn't compile in 4.x","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: \r\n3.8–3.11, 4.0.1\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\nTry to compile the following piece of code:\r\n```cs\r\nclass NestedArrayInitializer\r\n{\r\n    void main(bool f)\r\n    {\r\n        var x = new byte[1,1]\r\n        {\r\n            {f ? 1 : 4},\r\n        };\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwith Roslyn 3.x and with Roslyn 4.0.1.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nThe code compiles in both versions or produces an error in both versions.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n3.x compiles the code with the following control flow graph:\r\n![Roslyn4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/446776/160397019-8fa3e498-7454-4a9d-84ce-bae96958cb31.png)\r\n\r\nwhile 4.x produces an error message:\r\n```\r\nerror CS0266: Cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'byte'.

I assumed that the first stage of finding all modules and containers would be quick.\r\n\r\nAfter further performance analysis I discovered that this isn't actually the case.\r\n\r\nStrongInject finds all classes which:\r\n- Implement `StrongInject.Container`\r\n- Or have a Stronginject attribute\r\n- Or any of their members have a Stronginject attribute\r\n\r\nTo do this it has to visit all classes, and call `GetAllInterfaces`, `GetAllMembers`, and `GetAttributes` on every member. This turns out to be incredibly expensive even when StrongInject isn't used at all.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I simply added a reference to StrongInject to `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis` it increased compilation times by 10-20%:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29174528/160330656-aaf5b0d7-94e6-45eb-82a9-84f5d1a5862d.png)\r\n\r\nBecause checking if an attribute is of a particular type requires access to the actual symbol, this can't be done incrementally either - on every single edit we must visit all attributes. And this is something that the a large percentage of generators will need to go through - finding all usages of an attribute.\r\n\r\nIt would however be possible for roslyn to provide e.g. all attributes of a given type incrementally. I will attempt to sketch out how this could be done.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis\r\n{\r\n     public struct IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext\r\n     {\r\n+        public TypeUsagesProvider TypeUsagesProvider { get; }\r\n     }\r\n\r\n+   public struct TypeUsagesProvider\r\n+   {\r\n+       /// Creates an IncrementalValuesProvider<AttributeSyntax> that returns all attributes where the attribute class name matches any of fullAttributeNames.\r\n+       public IncrementalValuesProvider<AttributeSyntax> CreateAttributesProvider(params string[] fullAttributeNames);\r\n+       /// Creates an IncrementalValuesProvider<BaseTypeSyntax> that returns all base types where the type name matches any of fullTypeNames.\r\n+       public IncrementalValuesProvider<BaseTypeSyntax> CreateBaseTypesProvider(params string[] fullTypeNames);\r\n+       /// Creates an IncrementalValuesProvider<BaseParameterSyntax> that returns all parameters where the type name matches any of fullTypeNames.\r\n+       public IncrementalValuesProvider<BaseParameterSyntax> CreateParametersProvider(params string[] fullTypeNames);\r\n+   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course there's plenty more members that could be added - attributes, base lists, and parameters are just given as an example. Attributes however are the most critical.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nRoslyn will incrementally maintain a list of all global aliases. This can be done similarly to how it does this for DeclarationTable.Cache - most files stay the same, and one file is updated with the changed aliases.\r\n\r\nIt will then visit every file and recursively visit all namespace declarations in the file. It will check which aliases are in scope within each namespace declaration.\r\n\r\nThis should allow it to know at each point which identifiers could possibly refer to the requested type (candidates).\r\n\r\nIt will maintain an incremental list of candidates. When no global using aliases have changed (i.e. 99.99% of the time) only a single file will need to be visited to update the candidate list.\r\n\r\nOn every edit it then requests semantic information for each of those candidates and checks whether they indeed refer to the requested type.\r\n\r\nThis should be orders of magnitude more efficient than requesting semantic information for every single member on every single edit.\r\n\r\nI believe that doing this is impossible to do with the current Incremental Generators API, because only syntactical filtering can be done incrementally by the SyntaxProvider, and the syntactical filtering doesn't allow us to know which global usings exist.\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nStrongInject would initially use this as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nmodules = context.TypeUsagesProvider.CreateAttributesProvider(allStrongInjectAttributes)\r\n    .Collect().SelectMany(x => x.Select(x => GetContainingType(x)).Distinct);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a bit of effort it might be possible to use each attribute individually too rather than just using them to find the containing type, but just doing this should already be a huge performance boost.\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nStrongInject could require all containers and modules to mark themselves with a specific attribute, removing the need to visit interfaces and members. this would still have less than ideal performance characteristics.\r\n\r\nIt could also say it doesn't support global aliases, and implement this API itself.\r\n\r\nHowever I think this sounds like a general problem which requires a performant solution for everyone, and ideally one which is semantically accurate and doesn't just ignore global aliases.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nThe biggest risk is this API would need to duplicate the logic for how aliases work.

I'm also removing the old logic in the package download verifier to perform a proper check on the AuthentiCode checks and determine when the command itself is signed.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/24590","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add support to turn off signature verification for workload commands\" (#24590)"},{"Id":"1183386545","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T17:53:16","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"24585","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:bdbeb850-6d82-4277-c391-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/templating\r\n- **Subscription**: bdbeb850-6d82-4277-c391-08d8e9750d9d\r\n- **Build**: 20220328.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: March 28, 2022 3:52:10 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 74bf22c3320bdec69b15978c1e49307f27c2eb3a\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Utils**: [from 7.0.100-preview.4.22175.2 to 7.0.100-preview.4.22178.5][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ItemTemplates**: [from 7.0.100-preview.4.22175.2 to 7.0.100-preview.4.22178.5][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Abstractions**: [from 7.0.100-preview.4.22175.2 to 7.0.100-preview.4.22178.5][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Cli**: [from 7.0.100-preview.4.22175.2 to 7.0.100-preview.4.22178.5][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateSearch.Common**: [from 7.0.100-preview.4.22175.2 to 7.0.100-preview.4.22178.5][2]\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Orchestrator.RunnableProjects**: [from 7.0.100-preview.4.22175.2 to 7.0.100-preview.4.22178.5][2]\r\n\r\n[2]: https://github.com/dotnet/templating/compare/370053f...74bf22c\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:bdbeb850-6d82-4277-c391-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/24585","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating\" (#24585)"},{"Id":"1183762249","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-28T17:32:45","Actor":"heng-liu","Number":"24589","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a fabricbot.json file to auto close issues with \"Area-NuGet\" label","State":"open","Body":"The MerlinBot team previously sent out the email \"Heads up: Expect open PRs in your FabricBot enabled repos, onboarding you to config-as-code\".

Please describe.\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Project System](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) tries to provide the user all the available options for the `WarningLevel` property, along with a concise description of each, like so:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"510\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10506730/160206941-711bb45d-f42a-4a60-b29a-f0bf802dfa16.png\">\r\n\r\nThere are two problems with this:\r\n1. The Project System will always be playing catch up with the SDK as newer versions of the SDK come out. If the `WarningLevel` is set to a value the Project System doesn't know about we'll often end up showing nothing at all because we don't know how to interpret the value.\r\n2. If the user forces an older version of the SDK, the Project System may show them values that aren't meaningful. E.g., if the user forces the project to the .NET 5.0 SDK, we will still show \"6\" as an option because we don't know any better.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe SDK should provide the set of meaningful values, perhaps as a set of items:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"0\" />\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"1\" />\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"2\" />\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"3\" />\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"4\" />\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"5\" />\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"6\" />\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"7\" />\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevel Include=\"9999\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr perhaps as a set of properties:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n  <AvailableWarningLevels>0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;9999</AvailableWarningLevels>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Project System could then populate the dropdown using the values, avoiding the need for a change to VS every time a new warning level becomes available.\r\n\r\nIt would also be great if the SDK could provide the localized description of each warning level, but if that is difficult to do the Project System could continue to handle that part. The worse that would happen is there would be times when we don't have a description for a particular warning level.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/24570","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SDK should expose available WarningLevel values as MSBuild items\" (#24570)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1162990531","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-08T18:35:34","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"213","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2022-24512 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2022-24512 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 5.0, and .NET Core 3.1.

To give them access to CI logs in Azure DevOps pipelines\r\n\r\nThe first one is no longer necessary as GitHub has made a change that allows anyone to be assigned an issue so long they either have explicit permissions or have commented on the issue.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) was shipped in May 30, 2018 and was declared an LTS release with the 2.1.3 update in August 2018. The 3-year lifecycle for the 2.1 release has come to an end on August 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.1 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.1 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.1, will be accessible through the [.NET Downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) page. \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.1 has reached end of life\" (#199)"},{"Id":"974082248","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-08-18T21:49:10","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Main is now targeting .NET 7","State":"open","Body":"This is a heads up that the primary repos of the stack have branched for .NET 6 GA/servicing/RCs, and that the `main` branch for those repos has become .NET 7.\r\n\r\n## Anything special to note about .NET 7?\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between .NET 6 and .NET 7 flow is that the SDK repos will have their own channel (.NET 7.0.1xx SDK) from the very beginning.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"updating-2.1\"></a> Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework\r\nIf you are running .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework you need to check your projects for dependencies and update them accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\n* If your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 2.1 incrementally. This means that users who reference the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` package must add a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\n* The shared framework for .NET Core 3.1 and later does not include `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.dll`. Users targeting netcoreapp3.1 or later must also update their `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package version.\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 3.1 and later completely. This means users who reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` can bump that version to 2.1.30. They don't need a new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` reference.\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core or .NET 5, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

At the same time, continuing to build for all frameworks we ever shipped increases the complexity and size of a package. In the past, we've solved this issue by *harvesting*, which basically means:\r\n \r\n1. We build only for \"current\" frameworks\r\n2. During build, we download the earlier version of the package and \"harvest\" the binaries for earlier frameworks we no longer build for\r\n \r\nWhile this means that you can always update without worrying that we drop a framework it also means that you'll never get any bug fixes or new features if you consume a harvested binary. In other words, harvested assets can't be serviced which is now hidden because from your point of view you're able to keep updating the package to a later version even thought you're consuming the same old binary that we're no longer updating.\r\n \r\nFor .NET 6, we plan to no longer perform any form of harvesting to ensure that all assets we ship can be serviced. This means we're dropping anything older than:\r\n\r\n* .NET Framework 4.6.1\r\n* .NET Core 3.1\r\n* .NET Standard 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're currently referencing an impacted package from an earlier framework, you'll no longer be able to update the referenced package to a later version. Your choice is to either retarget your project to a later version or not updating the referenced package (which is generally not a huge take back because you're already consuming a frozen binary anyways).\r\n \r\n## Affected packages\r\n\r\nThese packages no longer ship old frameworks:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry.AccessControl`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition.Registration`\r\n* `System.Composition.AttributedModel`\r\n* `System.Composition.Convention`\r\n* `System.Composition.Hosting`\r\n* `System.Composition.Runtime`\r\n* `System.Composition.TypedParts`\r\n* `System.Data.Odbc`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.EventLog`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols`\r\n* `System.Drawing.Common`\r\n* `System.IO.Packaging`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipelines`\r\n* `System.Management`\r\n* `System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler`\r\n* `System.Reflection.Context`\r\n* `System.Runtime.Caching`\r\n* `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData`\r\n* `System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController`\r\n* `System.Speech`\r\n* `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages`\r\n* `System.Text.Encodings.Web`\r\n* `System.Threading.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Threading.Channels`\r\n\r\nThese packages will no longer be updated because their implementation is now part of the .NET 6 platform:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.IO.FileSystem.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Principal.Windows`\r\n\r\n## Timelines\r\n\r\nMany of these changes are shipping in .NET 6 Preview 5 while some will ship in .NET 6 Preview 6.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please comment in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54365.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/190","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dropping older framework versions\" (#190)"},{"Id":"915260827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-06-08T17:03:51","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0 and .NET Core 3.1.

This shift is intended to make it easier for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) customers to choose whether to allow .NET 6 and beyond on their environments, without the side effects a key shared between multiple products might have.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nToday Microsoft signs .NET artifacts with a variety of certificates. For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

So I suspect the behavior comes from `ilasm`.\n\nI verified that `ildasm` returns the correct order: `.field public int32 modopt(int64) modopt(string) modopt(int32) 'field'`.\nI also tested this with `ilasm` from Desktop and verified reflection output from Core (.NET 10p5). It prints out the expected order (`System.Int64` is first when doing `Console.WriteLine(typeof(C).GetField(\"field\").GetOptionalCustomModifiers().First().ToString());`).\n\nIn short, `ilasm`, `ildasm` and reflection agree. Maybe the issue is in the metadata reader or the compiler expectations?\n\nThe second test below shows that in scenarios where we copy modifiers, the order is correct.\n\n```csharp\n    [Fact]\n    public void TODO2()\n    {\n        var ilSrc = \"\"\"\n.class public auto ansi beforefieldinit C\n    extends [mscorlib]System.Object\n{\n    .field public int32 modopt(int64) modopt(string) modopt(int32) 'field'\n\n    .method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor () cil managed \n    {\n        IL_0000: ldarg.0\n        IL_0001: call instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::.ctor()\n        IL_0006: nop\n        IL_0007: ret\n    }\n}\n\"\"\";\n        var comp = CreateCompilationWithIL(\"\", ilSrc, options: TestOptions.UnsafeDebugDll);\n        comp.VerifyEmitDiagnostics();\n\n        var field = comp.GetMember<NamedTypeSymbol>(\"C\").GetField(\"field\");\n        AssertEx.Equal([\"System.Int32\", \"System.String\", \"System.Int64\"], field.TypeWithAnnotations.CustomModifiers.SelectAsArray(m => m.Modifier.ToTestDisplayString()));\n    }\n```\n\n```csharp\n    [Fact]\n    public void TestWrite()\n    {\n        var ilSrc = \"\"\"\n.class public auto ansi beforefieldinit Base\n\textends [mscorlib]System.Object\n{\n\t.method public hidebysig newslot virtual instance void modopt(int64) modopt(string) modopt(int32) M () cil managed \n\t{\n\t\tIL_0000: nop\n\t\tIL_0001: ret\n\t}\n\n\t.method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor () cil managed \n\t{\n\t\tIL_0000: ldarg.0\n\t\tIL_0001: call instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::.ctor()\n\t\tIL_0006: nop\n\t\tIL_0007: ret\n\t}\n}\n\"\"\";\n        var src = \"\"\"\npublic class C : Base\n{ \n    public override void M() { }\n}\n\"\"\";\n        var comp = CreateCompilationWithIL(src, ilSrc);\n        comp.VerifyEmitDiagnostics();\n\n        // The IL below shows expected order of modifiers (ignore that the test actually fails when re-run, that's due to variable assembly name for compiled IL)\n        CompileAndVerify(comp).VerifyTypeIL(\"C\", \"\"\"\n.class public auto ansi beforefieldinit C\n    extends ['_0_a81477ba-f57b-4bad-bd87-8e9609b8d968']Base\n{\n    // Methods\n    .method public hidebysig virtual \n        instance void modopt([netstandard]System.Int64) modopt([netstandard]System.String) modopt([netstandard]System.Int32) M () cil managed \n    {\n        // Method begins at RVA 0x2067\n        // Code size 1 (0x1)\n        .maxstack 8\n        IL_0000: ret\n    } // end of method C::M\n    .method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname \n        instance void .ctor () cil managed \n    {\n        // Method begins at RVA 0x2069\n        // Code size 7 (0x7)\n        .maxstack 8\n        IL_0000: ldarg.0\n        IL_0001: call instance void ['_0_a81477ba-f57b-4bad-bd87-8e9609b8d968']Base::.ctor()\n        IL_0006: ret\n    } // end of method C::.ctor\n} // end of class C\n\"\"\");\n    }\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79344","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unexpected order of custom modifiers read from metadata\" (#79344)"},{"Id":"3223317291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-11T21:19:58","Actor":"mattleibow","Number":"79338","RawContent":null,"Title":"CSharpUseNullPropagationCodeFixProvider for IDE0031 in SyntaxEditor fails with \"GetCurrentNode returned null\" on Windows and macOS but works on Linux","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: \n\n.NET 9 and .NET 10 SDK using `dotnet format`.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n1.

The ask here is to produce more information about the tests as a JSON payload. See for example [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/e026c5d5dc631a1213e644582d6e466f75ec45c6/tests/Directory.Build.targets#L44-L54) how dotnet/aspire is manually parsing a the non-machine readable output today, which feels to me it's very fragile approach. We could output for each test:\n\n- fully qualified type name, including arity and nesting (e.g, ``MyNamespace.MyTestClass+MyNestedTestClass`2``)\n- method name, e.g: `MyTestMethod`\n- method arity (probably only show it if generic)\n- traits as key-value pairs.\n- TestNodeUid\n\nMaybe we can consider also modeling test methods under the classes. So in the JSON we will have an array of test classes, and each test class will have an array child for test methods. In C#, we can represent it as following:\n\n```csharp\npublic class RootObject\n{\n    public TestClassInfo[] TestClasses { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class TestClassInfo\n{\n    public string FullyQualifiedTypeName { get; set; }\n    public TestMethodInfo[] TestMethods { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class TestMethodInfo\n{\n    public string TestNodeUid { get; set; }\n    public string MethodName { get; set; }\n    public string MethodArity { get; set; }\n    public KeyValuePair<string, string>[] Traits { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nIt's not very clear to me if this is more suited to be implemented in .NET SDK or in MTP itself.\n\nNOTE: The command should fail if `TestMethodIdentifierProperty` isn't set by frameworks.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49754","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow `dotnet test --list-tests json`\" (#49754)"},{"Id":"3225727561","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-12T20:02:52","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"49753","RawContent":null,"Title":"`AppendAssemblyResult` doesn't seem to handle the case of \"zero tests run\"","State":"open","Body":"I noticed in https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3343 while testing a non-working xunit.v3 version the following:\n\n```\nRunning tests from bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\MyXUnit3.exe (net8.0|x64)\nbin\\Debug\\net8.0\\MyXUnit3.exe (net8.0|x64) passed (302ms)\n\nTest run summary: Zero tests ran\n  total: 0\n  failed: 0\n  succeeded: 0\n  skipped: 0\n  duration: 4s 685ms\n```\n\nNOTE: The end summary has \"Zero tests ran\" and it fails correctly, but see the second line printing the assembly result showing it as \"passed\".","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49753","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`AppendAssemblyResult` doesn't seem to handle the case of \"zero tests run\"\" (#49753)"},{"Id":"3225710893","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-12T19:39:49","Actor":"baronfel","Number":"49751","RawContent":null,"Title":"push improved MSBuildLogger to a separate project in case we want to spin it off","State":"open","Body":"This is part of reducing the diff in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49556.\r\n\r\nDuring that PR, I implemented a number of improvements to the simple Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions.ILogger wrapper we had that ties that ILogger to MSBuild's ILogger interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe main feature is being able to use state/props from MEL.ILogger messages as inputs to MSbuild's various parameters on the `LogX` overloads - things like code, file, line, etc can now all be set by props.

What you're seeing tells us definitively:\n\nRuntimeIdentifier = win-AnyCPU is being set: This property is indeed getting this invalid value during the project evaluation.\n\nThe Culprit: The line C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.302\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.RuntimeIdentifierInference.targets (344,5) points directly to the source.\n\nThis is a core .NET SDK targets file, specifically designed for Runtime Identifier inference.\n\nLine 344 (and 345 for OutputPath) within this file is where the SDK is attempting to figure out the RuntimeIdentifier for your build when it's not explicitly provided.\n\nThe fact that it's inferring win-AnyCPU for a WinUI/MAUI project on Windows, even when your csproj lists valid win-x86, win-x64, win-arm64 RIDs and you've tried to set a default Platform, indicates a bug in the .NET SDK 9.0.302's inference logic. It's incorrectly combining the \"Windows\" platform with a general \"AnyCPU\" concept, which is not a valid Runtime Identifier.\"\n\n\"Report this bug to Microsoft: This behavior in dotnet SDK 9.0.302 is unexpected and should be reported. You can open an issue on the dotnet/sdk GitHub repository, providing the details you've uncovered (especially the binlog output showing Microsoft.NET.RuntimeIdentifierInference.targets (344,5) setting win-AnyCPU).\"\n\n************************************************************************\nIt seems your RuntimeIdentifierInference is overwriting RuntimeIdentifiers even when they are explicilty set.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nKevin\n\n******************************************************************************\ndotnet --info:\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.302\n Commit:

However, some environments for older SDKs may have previously calculated DOTNET_HOST_PATH to be the _directory_ containing the `dotnet` binary - not the correct semantic, which is the full path to the `dotnet` binary.\n\nThe SDK Container CreateNewImage ToolTask for net472 is one such example here, but there are likely others.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nTo mitigate this, we could consider only setting the env variables when the SDK resolved from the SdkResolver is 10+.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider setting DOTNET_HOST_PATH only for SDKs that are resolved to be >= 10.0\" (#49735)"},{"Id":"3220286881","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-10T18:31:35","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"49734","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cleanup dotnet test","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49734","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Cleanup dotnet test\" (#49734)"},{"Id":"3220278721","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-10T18:28:38","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"49733","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet test for MTP: Verify and add test for console app that does \"nothing\"","State":"open","Body":"We need to test the behavior of an empty console app that does nothing, and doesn't even handshake with us.

The apphost executable is named `$(AssemblyName)$(_NativeExecutableExtension)` \n2. On Unix, `$(_NativeExecutableExtension)` is empty, so the file is just named after the assembly (e.g., \"cs\")\n3. Packages with localized resources create culture directories with the same names (e.g., \"cs/\")\n4. MSBuild fails when trying to copy the apphost file to a location that's already a directory\n\n**Example failure:**\n```\ndotnet new console -o cs\ncd cs\ndotnet add package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp\ndotnet build\n```\n\nResults in:\n```\nerror MSB3024: Could not copy the file \"cs/obj/Debug/net10.0/apphost\" \nto the destination file \"bin/Debug/net10.0/cs\", because the destination is a folder instead of a file.\n```\n\n## Changes Made\n\n**Added NETSDK1229 Warning:**\n- New warning message in `Strings.resx` with clear description and solutions\n- Suggests renaming the application or restricting `SatelliteResourceLanguages` property\n\n**Implemented Detection Target:**\n- Added `_WarnForApphostCultureCollision` target in `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets`\n- Runs after `ResolvePackageAssets` to ensure `ResourceCopyLocalItems` are available\n- Only executes for executable projects with `UseAppHost=true`\n- Compares apphost filename with culture metadata from resource packages\n- Issues warning when collision is detected\n\n**Warning Message:**\n> NETSDK1229: The executable file name '{0}' may conflict with resource directories for culture '{1}'. Consider renaming the application or restricting the SatelliteResourceLanguages property to avoid this conflict.\n\nThis provides early detection of the collision issue with clear guidance on how to resolve it, improving the developer experience for this edge case.\n\nFixes #49731.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft.

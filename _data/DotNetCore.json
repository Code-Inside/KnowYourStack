And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression."},{"Id":"21130613758","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:52:00","Actor":"carlossanlop","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"21204834975","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-10T02:09:41","Actor":"tmat","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60665","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Pass options to FixAllAsync, simplify CodeAction registration\" (#60665) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"21204621958","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-10T01:13:59","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/60675","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Merge main to features/semi-auto-props\" (#60675) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from main into features/semi-auto-props.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/features/semi-auto-props\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

This is a release valve only intended for users who make heavy use of AssemblyLoadContext and are experiencing exceptions from this code path. It does not solve any of the issues that may arise from enabling this configuration.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThere is negligible risk involved with this change for most users. It is off-by-default and requires conscious action on the user's part to enable.\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, there _is_ a moderate amount of risk, as it is not a rigorously tested or previously supported scenario. Partner team validation and local testing of various scenarios showed that for specific use cases, it is sufficient.\r\n\r\nBelow is a collection of sample scenarios and the results of the traces when viewed in PerfView:\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with the _same_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: All events are received and correctly parsed\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with _different_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(int foo = 1) => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(string foo = \"foo\") => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: The last manifest received by PerfView is the one that gets used, so the `int` version of `MyEvent` gets parsed as the `string` version.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"705166145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-20T19:05:41","Actor":"Korporal","Number":"1775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confusing behavior when using AssemblyInfo.cs ","State":"open","Body":"I'm completely perplexed.\r\n\r\nI created a .Net Standard 2.0 library project.\r\n\r\nI explicity added an AssemblyInfo.cs file, we need this because we use this utility to \"stamp\" our assemblies when we build them:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ygoe/NetRevisionTool\r\n\r\nThat utility is run as a pre/post build event and temporarily replaces placeholders in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute with runtime values (like repo folder name, commit ID, branch etc etc).\r\n\r\nThe completed assembly then has this info \"burned\" into it as we go forward.\r\n\r\n.Net Standard is not working with this.\r\n\r\n1.

So redefining stream's sync object to lock over `this` achieves the same thing as the fix in 5.0 since operations over `Http2Stream` are guarded with stream's lock and operations with credit lock credit manager itself (separate sync object for window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReliability problem.\r\nReported by customer using YARP.

It's a one liner with ESLint - I can deactivate linting for a single line with `// eslint-disable-next-line`. \r\n\r\n![screenshot of \"// eslint-disable-next-line no-var\"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1010525/162576182-782893c4-3cc0-4a61-aa62-ed5ec005c6f2.png)\r\n\r\n2. ESLint has a VS Code extension which for lints it will present a lightbulb 💡. And one of the options is \"ignore the line\" which will apply a `// eslint-disable-next-line` to do just that.\r\n\r\n![screenshot of the lightbulb menu in TS/JS including \"Disable no-var for this line\"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1010525/162576039-e805290d-fd24-48eb-848b-32aacf87ed77.png)\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if a similar mechanisms existed in dotnet.\r\n\r\n## Single line ignore\r\n\r\nObviously I can ignore single lines in C#, but it takes me 2 lines of code to achieve it; like so:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n#pragma warning disable IDE0052\r\n    private readonly ILogger<WeatherForecastController> _logger;\r\n#pragma warning restore IDE0052\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if instead, something like this existed:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n#pragma warning disable-line IDE0052\r\n    private readonly ILogger<WeatherForecastController> _logger;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich disabled a single line of linting\r\n\r\n## Lightbulb\r\n\r\nImagine if the lightbulb with the C# extension offered the option to ignore a lint; just as the ESLint menu does.  Quite the timesaver. \r\n\r\nI'm not too sure where this feedback should go, but I thought I'd share it here to start with. What do people think? And more than that, is this the right place to discuss this?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/60668","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ESLint style single line ignore and lightbulb improvements\" (#60668)"},{"Id":"1197997063","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-09T01:26:08","Actor":"davidwengier","Number":"60664","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow shared projects to specify a real project to proxy too for building and testing in VS Code","State":"open","Body":"VS on my laptop is.. um.. special, so I run tests from VS Code reasonably often, but sadly if the file that has the tests is in a shared project, it doesn't work.

Use a different name and set @(GlobalAnalyzerConfigFiles) in both of the Directory.Build.props (src\\Languages and test\\Languages).  This will avoid picking up the originating config.

It's a c# app using PowerShell SDK. After the build step, the library is producing a directory 'runtimes\\win\\lib\\net7.0\\Modules' inside the output directory. This is a know limitation and needs to be corrected. This directory is not part of the solution so I can't use 'CopyAllways' for them.\r\n2. My custom after-build step moves 'Modules' directory from runtimes\\win\\lib\\net7.0\\' into $(BuildDir)  via simple xcopy cmd.\r\n3. Then, I'm trying to Publish my app using `dotnet publish` + 'IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract'\r\n4. Generated exe works, all files are extracted into `C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\AppName\\HvMvvKN+KAOI2f3u6KICq3APrz3_6Jw=\\` but the extracted folder structure is without applied custom after-build step.\r\n\r\nI've tried every After/Before Targets: \r\n```\r\nAfterTargets=\"AfterBuild\"\r\nAfterTargets=\"Build\"\r\nBeforeTargets=\"Publish\"\r\nBeforeTargets=\"BeforePublish\"\r\n```\r\nbut nothing works: extracted app content is as I would run 'build' without custom fix step. It's like the `dotnet publish` action didn't include all custom build steps by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n```\r\ndotnet --info\r\nZestaw .NET SDK (odzwierciedlenie dowolnego pliku global.json):\r\n Version:   7.0.100-preview.2.22153.17\r\n Commit:    9c52c56c13\r\n\r\nŚrodowisko uruchomieniowe:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.22579\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.100-preview.2.22153.17\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 7.0.0-preview.2.22152.2\r\n  Commit:  e24f66dff0\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  6.0.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.201 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  7.0.100-preview.2.22153.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.23 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.0-preview.2.22153.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.23 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.0-preview.2.22152.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.23 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.0-preview.2.22153.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/24763","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract and pre-publish tasks\" (#24763)"},{"Id":"1197136045","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-08T10:22:19","Actor":"WenJunJi01","Number":"24762","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Loc]With .NET 7 Preview 3 SDK installed on local OS, \"Installation Source\" is not localized after running \"dotnet workload list\"","State":"open","Body":"**Environment:** .NET SDK 7.0.100-preview.3.22179.4(runtime-7.0.0-preview.3.22175.4)\r\n\r\n**Repro steps:**\r\n1.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) was shipped in May 30, 2018 and was declared an LTS release with the 2.1.3 update in August 2018. The 3-year lifecycle for the 2.1 release has come to an end on August 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.1 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.1 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.1, will be accessible through the [.NET Downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) page. \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.1 has reached end of life\" (#199)"},{"Id":"974082248","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-08-18T21:49:10","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Main is now targeting .NET 7","State":"open","Body":"This is a heads up that the primary repos of the stack have branched for .NET 6 GA/servicing/RCs, and that the `main` branch for those repos has become .NET 7.\r\n\r\n## Anything special to note about .NET 7?\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between .NET 6 and .NET 7 flow is that the SDK repos will have their own channel (.NET 7.0.1xx SDK) from the very beginning.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"updating-2.1\"></a> Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework\r\nIf you are running .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework you need to check your projects for dependencies and update them accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\n* If your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 2.1 incrementally. This means that users who reference the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` package must add a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\n* The shared framework for .NET Core 3.1 and later does not include `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.dll`. Users targeting netcoreapp3.1 or later must also update their `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package version.\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 3.1 and later completely. This means users who reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` can bump that version to 2.1.30. They don't need a new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` reference.\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core or .NET 5, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

At the same time, continuing to build for all frameworks we ever shipped increases the complexity and size of a package. In the past, we've solved this issue by *harvesting*, which basically means:\r\n \r\n1. We build only for \"current\" frameworks\r\n2. During build, we download the earlier version of the package and \"harvest\" the binaries for earlier frameworks we no longer build for\r\n \r\nWhile this means that you can always update without worrying that we drop a framework it also means that you'll never get any bug fixes or new features if you consume a harvested binary. In other words, harvested assets can't be serviced which is now hidden because from your point of view you're able to keep updating the package to a later version even thought you're consuming the same old binary that we're no longer updating.\r\n \r\nFor .NET 6, we plan to no longer perform any form of harvesting to ensure that all assets we ship can be serviced. This means we're dropping anything older than:\r\n\r\n* .NET Framework 4.6.1\r\n* .NET Core 3.1\r\n* .NET Standard 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're currently referencing an impacted package from an earlier framework, you'll no longer be able to update the referenced package to a later version. Your choice is to either retarget your project to a later version or not updating the referenced package (which is generally not a huge take back because you're already consuming a frozen binary anyways).\r\n \r\n## Affected packages\r\n\r\nThese packages no longer ship old frameworks:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry.AccessControl`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition.Registration`\r\n* `System.Composition.AttributedModel`\r\n* `System.Composition.Convention`\r\n* `System.Composition.Hosting`\r\n* `System.Composition.Runtime`\r\n* `System.Composition.TypedParts`\r\n* `System.Data.Odbc`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.EventLog`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols`\r\n* `System.Drawing.Common`\r\n* `System.IO.Packaging`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipelines`\r\n* `System.Management`\r\n* `System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler`\r\n* `System.Reflection.Context`\r\n* `System.Runtime.Caching`\r\n* `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData`\r\n* `System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController`\r\n* `System.Speech`\r\n* `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages`\r\n* `System.Text.Encodings.Web`\r\n* `System.Threading.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Threading.Channels`\r\n\r\nThese packages will no longer be updated because their implementation is now part of the .NET 6 platform:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.IO.FileSystem.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Principal.Windows`\r\n\r\n## Timelines\r\n\r\nMany of these changes are shipping in .NET 6 Preview 5 while some will ship in .NET 6 Preview 6.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please comment in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54365.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/190","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dropping older framework versions\" (#190)"},{"Id":"915260827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-06-08T17:03:51","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0 and .NET Core 3.1.

This shift is intended to make it easier for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) customers to choose whether to allow .NET 6 and beyond on their environments, without the side effects a key shared between multiple products might have.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nToday Microsoft signs .NET artifacts with a variety of certificates. For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change.

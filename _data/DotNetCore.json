You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present.

It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone.

Sends on a WebSocket can't run concurrently, and there's a lock that protects access to shared resources, including a pooled buffer.  The code that ends a send operation returns the buffer to the pool and releases the lock, but it does so in the opposite (wrong) order.  As such, a second concurrent send could end up trying to use the buffer concurrently with the first send operation releasing it.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported as a sporadic ArgumentException that escapes from within the WebSocket implementation (from valid usage).  But in theory it could result in data corruption throughout the process, with a buffer being returned to the pool while it's still in use.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow.  The fix just swaps two instructions (in three places) to return the buffer before releasing the lock.\r\n\r\ncc: @danmosemsft ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42950","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Fix ManagedWebSocket ordering of releasing send buffer and semaphore\" (#42950)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Roslyn-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"694613293","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-07T01:31:37","Actor":"jmarolf","Number":"47507","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update and Revise README","State":"open","Body":"- cleanup language discussion section\n- have the API section point to public docuementation\n- re-write contributing section\n- small update to questions section\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47507","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update and Revise README\" (#47507)"},{"Id":"694563434","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T23:07:49","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"47506","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove the three unnecessary using statements from the c# new class template","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/idea/773358/remove-the-three-unnecessary-using-statements-from.html)._\n\n---\n<p>When creating a new c# class this is what happens by default:</p><p>- Ctrl+Shift+A - to create a new class<br>- Roslyn &amp; Intellisense kick in, automagically parse my new class and pop up a light bulb telling me to remove the three unused using statements.</p> <p>- I hit Ctrl+R, G to remove them.</p> <p>- I go to the default new c# class template and remove the using statements to stop this happening again.</p> <p><br></p><p>Could you consider tweaking the c# new class template so it doesn't include three unnecessary using statements that are just going to trigger Visual Studio intellisense wizardry anyway?</p>\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Jane Wu [MSFT] on 10/11/2019, 07:59 PM: \n\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to provide your suggestion.

Generally the author whose change introduced the conflicts should pull down this PR, fix the conflicts locally, then push up a commit resolving the conflicts.\n\n### Resolve merge conflicts using your local repo\nSometimes merge conflicts may be present on GitHub but merging locally will work without conflicts. This is due to differences between the merge algorithm used in local git versus the one used by GitHub.\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/master-to-features/source-generators\ngit reset --hard upstream/features/source-generators\ngit merge upstream/master\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/master-to-features/source-generators --force\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47492","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merge master to features/source-generators\" (#47492)"},{"Id":"694363975","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T15:16:57","Actor":"abdonkasengo","Number":"47499","RawContent":null,"Title":"WebApplicationError CS1061 'int' does not contain a definition for 'Visible' and no extension method 'Visible' accepting a first argument of type 'int' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)","State":"closed","Body":"```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing System.Web;\r\nusing System.Web.UI;\r\nusing System.Web.UI.WebControls;\r\n\r\nnamespace WebApplicationHello\r\n{\r\n    public partial class _Default : Page\r\n    {\r\n        private int Imagecamera;\r\n\r\n        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected void Buttonhello_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            Imagecamera.Visible = !Imagecamera.Visible;\r\n            if (TxtFirstname.Text !=\"\" && TxtFirstname.Text!=\"\")\r\n            {\r\n                LabelOutput.Text= \"Hello\" + TxtFirstname.Text +\" \" +\r\n                    TxtSecondname.Text + \",where is the bear?\";\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected void TxtFirstname_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected void TxtSecondname_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeverity\tCode\tDescription\tProject\tFile\tLine\tSuppression State\r\nError\tCS1061\t'int' does not contain a definition for 'Visible' and no extension method 'Visible' accepting a first argument of type 'int' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\tWebApplicationHello\tC:\\Users\\user\\OneDrive\\awd mrjoel\\WebApplicationHello\\WebApplicationHello\\Default.aspx.cs\t21\tActive\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47499","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"WebApplicationError CS1061 'int' does not contain a definition for 'Visible' and no extension method 'Visible' accepting a first argument of type 'int' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\" (#47499)"},{"Id":"694415779","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T15:11:31","Actor":"sharwell","Number":"47500","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use a module initializer to install ThrowingTraceListener","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47500","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Use a module initializer to install ThrowingTraceListener\" (#47500)"},{"Id":"693896797","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T14:58:46","Actor":"dotMorten","Number":"47481","RawContent":null,"Title":"For non-annotated APIs please assume reference types returned could be null","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: netcoreapp3.1 / VS16.7.2\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n1.

The original comment was [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/pull/3429#issuecomment-678569706) in the PR where I stumbled upon this bug. I've also already sent an email to the .NET Native team with a repro and a sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nUsing a custom `ref T` returning delegate seems to trigger a build error on UWP. Consider this snippet:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic delegate ref T FieldAccessor<T>();\r\n\r\nprivate int n;\r\n\r\nprivate void Button_OnClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    FieldAccessor<int> accessor = () => ref n;\r\n\r\n    accessor() = default;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreating a blank app and just adding that code results in the following error:\r\n\r\n> ILT0005: 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\UWPNuGetPackages\\runtime.win10-x64.microsoft.net.native.compiler\\2.2.8-rel-28605-00\\tools\\x64\\ilc\\Tools\\nutc_driver.exe @\"C:\\Users\\Sergio\\source\\repos\\FieldAccessorRepro\\FieldAccessorRepro\\obj\\x64\\Release\\ilc\\intermediate\\MDIL\\FieldAccessorRepro.rsp\"' returned exit code 2\r\n\r\nYou can find a full repro project to download [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/files/5111764/FieldAccessorRepro.zip).\r\n\r\nThis bug is currently blocking one of the follow up PRs for the `Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm` package ([here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/issues/3428)), as it causes the build to just fail on UWP. I'm hoping this could be solved with some trick/workaround on the UWP side, as I'd really, really like not to be forced to alter the API surface on the .NET Standard side for a specific issue with the .NET Native compiler.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! 😊","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[.NET Native] ILT0005 build error with ref T returning delegate\" (#8273)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"SDK-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"694616199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-07T04:05:29","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"13428","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/5.0.1xx-rc2] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:417b2982-fde8-462c-a3ba-08d849eee92a)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 417b2982-fde8-462c-a3ba-08d849eee92a\r\n- **Build**: 20200906.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/7/2020 1:00 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 918dfdcebc70489d28cc40fda9497bd6c3b0db65\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/5.0-rc2\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present. As .NET 5 releases and adoption increases the assumption would be this issue will become more common.\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/38950 for user reported issue.\r\n\r\n.NET 5 PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40228.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from .NET Framework and has been present since COM support was added to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidation of the above user scenario and updated tests in .NET 5 to verify the scenario. The test updates did not get ported to this PR but can be if those changes are desired. The minimum updates to tests were applied here to enable build and run of existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThe risk of this change has two facets. It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28073","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[.NET Core 3.1] Don't rely on the built-in interface marshaller during COM activation.\" (#28073)"},{"Id":"670175635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T23:15:55","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

Local testing has been done to confirm the fix is applicable and the driver can now come out of infinite loop and throw exception.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low:** The fix is not a major functional change, and it applies only to Linux/Mac customers if their servers are not updated to support TLS 1.2.

This change is a candidate to be taken into Dev16.8 P2 release QB bar check\r\n2. This change does not affect analyzer execution in command line/batch  build. It only affects executing in IDE live analysis as per-file diagnostic requests are only made for the latter. The changes are contained in the following method which is only invoked from IDE live analysis: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/163404b1385780bee5fc8a19a9ffc8ca44fdb773/src/Compilers/Core/Portable/DiagnosticAnalyzer/CompilationWithAnalyzers.cs#L678\r\n\r\n**Issue Description:**\r\nWhile editing source files for types with multiple partial type declarations spanning multiple files, the diagnostic computation in OOP process can deadlock and hog the CPU continuously at 70-80%. No diagnostics are updated in VS after this and VS needs to be restarted to get back diagnostics. Unfortunately, VS again enters similar state in the new session after some time.\r\n\r\n**Regression:**\r\nThis is a regression in user experience caused by our recent change to move open file diagnostic computation to OOP + execute them concurrently. Earlier, they used to run inside devenv, hence the analysis was done sequentially for responsiveness/GC concerns. Executing open file diagnostic computation requests concurrently uncovered this bug.\r\n\r\n**Fix Description:**\r\nIn presence of SymbolStart/SymbolEnd analyzers, computing analyzer semantic diagnostics for a syntax tree needs to force complete analyzer execution for all syntax trees that have a partial declaration for any symbol defined in the original syntax tree for which diagnostics were requested. SymbolStart/End analyzers can report diagnostics only after all such partial have finished analysis.\r\nWe already handle this in the code by invoking local function `processPartialSymbolLocationsAsync`, which in turn waits for diagnostic computation tasks for all `partialTrees`: \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/163404b1385780bee5fc8a19a9ffc8ca44fdb773/src/Compilers/Core/Portable/DiagnosticAnalyzer/CompilationWithAnalyzers.cs#L698-L701\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/163404b1385780bee5fc8a19a9ffc8ca44fdb773/src/Compilers/Core/Portable/DiagnosticAnalyzer/CompilationWithAnalyzers.cs#L752-L758\r\n\r\nThis all seems fine. However, after doing this perform additional wait for _all_ active tree tasks: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/163404b1385780bee5fc8a19a9ffc8ca44fdb773/src/Compilers/Core/Portable/DiagnosticAnalyzer/CompilationWithAnalyzers.cs#L706-L707\r\nThis was causing a deadlock when multiple requests came in at the same time for the trees in the above partial set - both the requests wait for active tasks to its other partial trees to complete, but cannot complete as they are waiting for each other.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to remove the unnecessary `WaitForActiveAnalysisTasksAsync` + the do/while loop as the call to `processPartialSymbolLocationsAsync` already handles force completing required partial tree diagnostics.\r\n \r\n**Testing:**\r\n1. I added a unit test in this PR which deadlocks with this issue prior to the fix.\r\n2. I have a consistent real world repro that hits this deadlock, and is fixed with this change:\r\n   1. Open Roslyn.sln from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn\r\n   2. Open files https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/src/Compilers/CSharp/Test/IOperation/IOperation/IOperationTests.cs and https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/src/Compilers/CSharp/Test/IOperation/IOperation/IOperationTests_ArrayCreationAndInitializer.cs. These test file have a type with 40+ partial declarations.\r\n   3. Rebuild https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/src/Compilers/CSharp/Test/IOperation/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.IOperation.UnitTests.csproj\r\n   4. Wait for the build to finish\r\n   5. You should now see the service process hung at 70-80% CPU and never complete\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/46874","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Avoid deadlock while computing open file semantic diagnostics\" (#46874)"},{"Id":"680187958","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-17T12:12:31","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"46871","RawContent":null,"Title":"FromRuntimeTypeOfLiteralValue method implementation","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/8f4fdad99ae8f4d0000e37a244b152edcec89d0d/src/Compilers/Core/Portable/SpecialTypeExtensions.cs#L275-L358\r\n\r\nThis implementation doesn't cover the following `SpecialType`s:\r\n\r\n- System_ArgIterator\r\n- System_Array\r\n- System_AsyncCallback\r\n- System_Collections_Generic_ICollection_T\r\n- System_Collections_Generic_IEnumerable_T\r\n\r\netc (there are many others).\r\n\r\nIt will return `SpecialType.None` even if there is a suitable SpecialType.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/46871","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FromRuntimeTypeOfLiteralValue method implementation\" (#46871)"},{"Id":"680149504","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-17T11:06:48","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"46868","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove unnecessary IDE0060 suppression","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/46868","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Remove unnecessary IDE0060 suppression\" (#46868)"},{"Id":"679951580","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-17T05:43:53","Actor":"medoni","Number":"46867","RawContent":null,"Title":"Show pattern formats in intellisense for Guid.ToString","State":"open","Body":"**Brief description:**\r\nShow intellisense suggestions for Guid.ToString(). \r\n\r\n**Languages applicable:**\r\nC# + VB\r\n\r\n**Code example that the analyzer should report:**\r\n```csharp\r\nConsole.WriteLine(Gui.NewGuid().ToString(\"N\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional information:**\r\nSame like https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/17011\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/46867","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Show pattern formats in intellisense for Guid.ToString\" (#46867)"},{"Id":"679921631","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-17T04:22:33","Actor":"YairHalberstadt","Number":"46866","RawContent":null,"Title":"Track related Nullable state of two objects ","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: VS 16.8 preview 1\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n#nullable enable\r\npublic class C {\r\n    public void M(string a, string b) {\r\n        if (a is null && b is null)\r\n        {\r\n            // do something\r\n        }\r\n        else if (a is null && b is not null)\r\n        {\r\n            // do something\r\n        }\r\n        else if (a is not null && b is null)\r\n        {\r\n            // do something\r\n        }\r\n        else if (a.Equals(b))\r\n        {\r\n            // do something\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**: \r\nno warning on `a.Equals(b)`\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n> warning CS8602: Dereference of a possibly null reference.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/46866","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Track related Nullable state of two objects \" (#46866)"},{"Id":"679855177","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-17T00:07:18","Actor":"daxian-dbw","Number":"46865","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use Roslyn compilation in .NET Core with `ConsoleApplication` and `WindowsApplication` output kind both generate .exe files that depend on mscoree.dll","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**:  Microsoft.Codeanalysis.CSharp 3.7.0\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\nWe use the Roslyn compilation for `Add-Type` in PowerShell Core (on top of .NET Core, PowerShell 7 is LTS and with .NET Core 3.1), you can view the code [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/AddType.cs).\r\n\r\n`Add-Type` [supports 3 output kinds](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/AddType.cs#L887-L900): `DynamicallyLinkedLibrary`, `ConsoleApplication` and\r\n`WindowsApplication`.

Could the same be done for CoreRT without reflection?  Mono is returning mono specific types, e.g. `MonoMethod*` but might be better to make those just opaque `IntPtr`s as in java script land they are just `number` type anyway.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

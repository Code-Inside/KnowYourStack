There seems to be an intermittent issue in CI where the unit test projects themselves will fail to build because of the TestPackages scaffolding. In the error below, you can see that the `Microsoft.NET.Build.Containers.UnitTests.csproj` failed because of it trying to find `dotnet-portable` assets, which is strange. The relationship between the test package creation and the unit test project builds would need to be investigated.\r\n\r\n```\r\nD:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\.dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.100-preview.5.24307.3\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Publish.targets(355,5):\r\nerror MSB3030: Could not copy the file \"D:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\Assets\\TestPackages\\dotnet-portable\\obj\\84f5ddf7-12f3-44b6-9898-5da1b99237c3.tmp\" because it was not found.\r\n[D:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\test\\Microsoft.NET.Build.Containers.UnitTests\\Microsoft.NET.Build.Containers.UnitTests.csproj::TargetFramework=net9.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Binlog\r\nhttps://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/miyanni/EaZsT9xh-hVCu4h_1J2VonQBSJooCtr2KeSZcfahWBvIvg?e=vrq3Pa"},{"Id":"40080008653","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T22:10:33","Actor":"MiYanni","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/42083","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix double build of test packages for Helix\" (#42083) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Resolves: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/42045\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAfter looking over the binlog, it looks like the `BuildTestPackages.target` is running twice. It runs once as part of the normal build process of `Microsoft.NET.TestFramework.csproj`, but also runs prior in the sibling MSBuild process used by `XUnitRunner.targets` to run the `PublishWithOutput` target. The `XUnitRunner.targets` is imported in `UnitTests.proj`, so that ends up causing `Microsoft.NET.TestFramework.csproj` to build twice.\r\n\r\nNow, likely, there is a way to simplify this whole process of producing the test payload for Helix, but in lieu of that, this should fix it double building the test packages, which causes intermittent failures in CI. To resolve this, I've added a `BuildTestPackages` property to control importing the `BuildTestPackages.targets` (and `SetupTestRoot.targets`, which is part of the same process for Helix usage). This means that local dev builds will still run these targets properly, but only the `XUnitRunner.targets` won't cause them to be imported."},{"Id":"40079899438","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T22:04:30","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/42119","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Alpine 3.20\" (#42119) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Related to https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/4399"},{"Id":"40078370753","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-07-11T20:51:25","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/42118","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Localized file check-in by OneLocBuild Task: Build definition ID 140: Build ID 2493148\" (#42118) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This is the pull request automatically created by the OneLocBuild task in the build process to check-in localized files generated based upon translation source files (.lcl files) handed-back from the downstream localization pipeline.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

This changed a consumption of that method in a completely different class, but ran into some conflicts in some of the targets, making the following change:\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\n/* Unmerged change from project 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell (net472)'\r\nBefore:\r\n            if (this.IsBuiltInLocalService(serviceGuid, out Type? serviceType))\r\nAfter:\r\n            if (Package.IsBuiltInLocalService(serviceGuid, out Type? serviceType))\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause I had existing changes in this file, I did not see this change until after I committed and pushed to my origin.  Looking at my tree right now, I see others ran into this and those changes got merged into the tree unbeknownst to them. You can see [hundreds of examples of this across Github](https://github.com/search?q=%22Unmerged+change+from+project%22+language%3AC%23&type=code&l=C%23).\r\n\r\n## Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nI think it would a better experience here if Roslyn choose to use merge markers here to make it painfully obvious that this should be addressed before merging.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to this:\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\n<<<<<<< Unmerged change from project 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell (net472), before:\r\n            if (this.IsBuiltInLocalService(serviceGuid, out Type? serviceType))\r\n=======\r\n            if (IsBuiltInLocalService(serviceGuid, out Type? serviceType))\r\n>>>>>>> After\r\n```\r\n\r\nRoslyn already automatically recognizes these and shows an error, making a very friendly way of finding these.\r\n```\r\nCS8300\tMerge conflict marker encountered\t\r\nCS8300\tMerge conflict marker encountered\t\r\nCS8300\tMerge conflict marker encountered\t\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/74366","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"\"Unmerged changes\" should use merge markers to mark refactoring conflicts across multiple targets\" (#74366)"},{"Id":"2403795535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-12T00:39:22","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"74358","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simplify passing around of FAR symbol groups","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70850\r\nFixes https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/2135708","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74358","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Simplify passing around of FAR symbol groups\" (#74358)"},{"Id":"2404391153","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-12T00:17:07","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"74365","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build feature.debugger.main-35111.61","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/b81c07e272dfe0454704c44879fc9f306288acbc...0971b49f5852a2ed2d091c3e5343a43e909b10ec?w=1)\n- [Allow Document.FilePath to be set to null (74290)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74290)\n- [Fix msbuild issue (74293)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74293)\n- [Remove fallback options from IdeAnalyzerOptions (74235)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74235)\n- [Improve parser recovery around nullable types in patterns (72805)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72805)\n- [Syntax formatting options (74223)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74223)\n- [Localized file check-in by OneLocBuild Task: Build definition ID 327: Build ID 2490585 (74287)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/74287)\n- [17.11: Add weak heuristics in our designer scanning code to improve experience during things like configuration switch.

Configuration Manager shows that the solution is only configured for Build (in both Debug and Release configurations), but it is not selected for Deploy.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because as a result hitting \"Run with Debugging\" in VS for an android target (and I assume for an ios target, too) will not actually deploy and debug the project.  Instead the build window shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2>------ Skipped Deploy: Project: maui2, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------\r\n2>Project not selected to build for this solution configuration \r\n```\r\n\r\nManually right-clicking on the solution and checking the \"Deploy\" checkbox for the configuration(s) makes it work, but it is not obvious that is what is required.\r\n\r\nCompare these two `.sln` files.  \r\n\r\nThis is what you get from `dotnet sln add`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 12.00\r\n# Visual Studio Version 17\r\nVisualStudioVersion = 17.0.31903.59\r\nMinimumVisualStudioVersion = 10.0.40219.1\r\nProject(\"{9A19103F-16F7-4668-BE54-9A1E7A4F7556}\") = \"maui2\", \"maui2.csproj\", \"{3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}\"\r\nEndProject\r\nGlobal\r\n        GlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution\r\n                Debug|Any CPU = Debug|Any CPU\r\n                Release|Any CPU = Release|Any CPU\r\n        EndGlobalSection\r\n        GlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Debug|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Debug|Any CPU\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Debug|Any CPU.Build.0 = Debug|Any CPU\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Release|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Release|Any CPU\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Release|Any CPU.Build.0 = Release|Any CPU\r\n        EndGlobalSection\r\n        GlobalSection(SolutionProperties) = preSolution\r\n                HideSolutionNode = FALSE\r\n        EndGlobalSection\r\nEndGlobal\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is what you get if you click the 'Deploy' checkboxes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 12.00\r\n# Visual Studio Version 17\r\nVisualStudioVersion = 17.0.31903.59\r\nMinimumVisualStudioVersion = 10.0.40219.1\r\nProject(\"{9A19103F-16F7-4668-BE54-9A1E7A4F7556}\") = \"maui2\", \"maui2.csproj\", \"{3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}\"\r\nEndProject\r\nGlobal\r\n        GlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution\r\n                Debug|Any CPU = Debug|Any CPU\r\n                Release|Any CPU = Release|Any CPU\r\n        EndGlobalSection\r\n        GlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Debug|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Debug|Any CPU\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Debug|Any CPU.Build.0 = Debug|Any CPU\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Debug|Any CPU.Deploy.0 = Debug|Any CPU\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Release|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Release|Any CPU\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Release|Any CPU.Build.0 = Release|Any CPU\r\n                {3BE1E2A0-90E0-4D42-92B2-D7CDDA300CEE}.Release|Any CPU.Deploy.0 = Release|Any CPU\r\n        EndGlobalSection\r\n        GlobalSection(SolutionProperties) = preSolution\r\n                HideSolutionNode = FALSE\r\n        EndGlobalSection\r\nEndGlobal\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n\r\n Version:   8.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 8.0.3\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.5  Runtime or .NET 8.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.19 or SDK 7.0.119 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty.

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET.

It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BinaryFormatter is being removed in .NET 9\" (#293)"},{"Id":"2072888869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:52","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"292","RawContent":null,"Title":" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96700\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner.

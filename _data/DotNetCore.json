I will try to be as descriptive as possible in this issue.\n\nI have a record that inherits from a record in a different assembly (I don't know if this is relevant information).

When I compile, the following error appears:\n\n```text\n  Modules.Authentication.Features failed with 1 error(s) (0.4s)\n    /home/nullptr/banana-for-scale-v2/src/Modules/Authentication/Modules.Authentication.Features/Common/AuthResponse.cs(17,17): error CS7036: There is no argument given that corresponds to the required parameter 'original' of 'BaseResponse<AuthenticationResponse>.BaseResponse(BaseResponse<AuthenticationResponse>)'\n  Modules.Users.Application succeeded (0.6s) → artifacts/bin/Modules.Users.Application/debug/Modules.Users.Application.dll\n```\n\nThe analyzer also complains about: \n\n<img width=\"941\" height=\"191\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66c46251-9070-4bf5-a768-b7bb2bd41258\" />\n\nThis parameter 'original' isn't even present in the base class or anything like that. It seems to me to be something internal to the compiler.\n\nI am willing to contribute with more information.

Consider the sample below. (Might be related to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/78106.)\n\nIn a simple switch expression, I return an `IEnumerable<char>` for a bunch of known values. For unknown values, I want to fulfill the contract of the enumerable, so I use the nice collection expression syntax to return `[c]`. Looks nice, but on a very hot path, I noticed significant GC.\n\n### Question\nTurns out that the collection expression allocates a temporary array, apparently for no reason.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

During type completion, if the type has members with nullable annotations, the compiler attempts to ensure `NullableContextAttribute` exists by calling `EnsureEmbeddableAttributeExists` with `modifyCompilation: true`.\n\nThis could trigger an assertion failure:\n```csharp\nDebug.Assert(!modifyCompilation || !_needsGeneratedAttributes_IsFrozen);\n```\n\nThe assertion fires because the `_needsGeneratedAttributes_IsFrozen` flag may already be set when completing unmodified types during EnC delta compilation.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe code already has the correct fix through special handling in `PEModuleBuilder.GetNeedsGeneratedAttributesInternal()`:\n\n```csharp\nreturn (EmbeddableAttributes)_needsGeneratedAttributes | \n       Compilation.GetNeedsGeneratedAttributes(freezeState: this is not PEDeltaAssemblyBuilder);\n```\n\nWhen compiling an EnC delta (`PEDeltaAssemblyBuilder`), we pass `freezeState: false`, which prevents the Compilation's `_needsGeneratedAttributes_IsFrozen` flag from being set. This allows late completion of unmodified types without triggering the assertion.\n\n## Changes\n\nThis PR adds a regression test `NullableContextAttribute_UnmodifiedTypeCompletion` that:\n\n1. Creates a baseline compilation without nullable reference types\n2. Emits an EnC delta that:\n   - Updates a method to call an unmodified method (triggering completion of the unmodified type)\n   - Adds a new method with nullable annotations (requiring `NullableContextAttribute` generation)\n3. Verifies that nullable attributes are correctly synthesized without assertion failures\n4. Includes comprehensive documentation explaining the scenario and the existing fix mechanism\n\n## Testing\n\n- New test passes on both .NET 9.0 and .NET Framework 4.7.2\n- All 214 existing `EditAndContinueTests` continue to pass with no regressions\n\n## Follow-up\n\nAs mentioned in the issue, a benchmark test should be added to the `dotnet/performance` repository to measure EnC performance and ensure the performance gains from #71254 are maintained. This will be tracked separately as it requires work in a different repository.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This

Primary constructors have their declaring syntax on the type declaration itself, not a constructor declaration.\n\n2. **Dual Path Handling**:\n   - **Regular constructors**: Continue to add assignment statements in the constructor body (existing behavior)\n   - **Primary constructors**: Add initializers to property/field declarations (new behavior)\n\n3. **Cross-Language Compatibility**: \n   - Uses reflection to call C# syntax methods for property initializers (since the portable Features layer can't directly reference C# assemblies)\n   - Uses `SyntaxGenerator.WithInitializer` for field initializers (works cross-language)\n   - VB.NET doesn't have primary constructors, so the new code path won't execute for VB code\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded test cases in `AddConstructorParametersFromMembersTests.cs`:\n- `TestAddParameterToPrimaryConstructor_Property` - Single property\n- `TestAddParameterToPrimaryConstructor_Field` - Single field  \n- `TestAddParameterToPrimaryConstructor_MultipleProperties` - Multiple properties\n\nThe implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase, particularly the `InitializeParameterHelpers` for handling primary constructor initializers.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>'Add parameter' to primary constructor doesn't assign the property it was added for</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**:\n> VS 2026 11018.127\n> \n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\n> ```cs\n> public class MyClass(int myProperty)\n> {\n>     public int MyProperty { get; set; } = myProperty;\n> \n>     public int MyProperty1 { get; set; }\n> }\n> ```\n> Invoke 'Add parameter to MyClass(int myProperty)' on `MyProperty1`\n> \n> **Expected Behavior**:\n> ```cs\n> public class MyClass(int myProperty, int myProperty1)\n> {\n>     public int MyProperty { get; set; } = myProperty;\n> \n>     public int MyProperty1 { get; set; } = myProperty1;\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> \n> **Actual Behavior**:\n> ```cs\n> public class MyClass(int myProperty, int myProperty1)\n> {\n>     public int MyProperty { get; set; } = myProperty;\n> \n>     public int MyProperty1 { get; set; }\n> }\n> ```\n> Notice how there is no assignment of `MyProperty1` to the new parameter, so I get a compiler warning and have to write that assignment myself.

However, upgrading to C# 13 didn't fix the issue—instead, it showed \"Pointers and fixed size buffers may only be used in an unsafe context\". This created a misleading upgrade path.\n\nExample:\n```csharp\nunsafe class C\n{\n    IEnumerable<int> M()\n    {\n        yield return 1;\n        local();\n        void local()\n        {\n            int* p = null; // C# 12: suggests upgrade to C# 13\n                          // C# 13: requires unsafe context\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue stems from how iterators handle unsafe contexts between C# versions:\n- In C# 12 and below: iterators incorrectly inherit unsafe context from their containing scope (spec violation)\n- In C# 13+: iterators correctly establish a safe context\n\nWhen the compiler detected pointer usage in nested local functions, it saw:\n1. We're in an unsafe region (inherited through the iterator in C# 12)\n2. We're indirectly in an iterator\n3. The feature is not available → report language version error\n\nBut this was misleading because upgrading to C# 13 wouldn't help—the iterator would establish a safe context, requiring an explicit `unsafe` modifier on the local function.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis PR fixes the diagnostic logic in two places:\n\n1. **`InMethodBinder.IsIndirectlyInIterator`**: Now correctly checks the parent binder chain for nested functions, ensuring we properly detect when code is indirectly within an iterator.\n\n2. **`Binder_Unsafe.GetUnsafeDiagnosticInfo`**: Improved to report `ERR_UnsafeNeeded` instead of `ERR_FeatureNotAvailableInVersion12` when:\n   - Code is indirectly in an iterator but not directly in one\n   - The containing member is not itself an iterator\n   - The unsafe context is inherited (not from an explicit `unsafe` modifier)\n\nThis provides users with the correct diagnostic in C# 12, matching what they'd see in C# 13, and clearly indicates that the solution is to add an `unsafe` modifier to the local function.\n\n## After this fix\n\n```csharp\nunsafe class C\n{\n    IEnumerable<int> M()\n    {\n        yield return 1;\n        local();\n        void local()\n        {\n            int* p = null; // Both C# 12 & 13: CS0214 - requires unsafe context\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe fix ensures consistent, helpful error messages across language versions and correctly guides users to the proper solution.\n\nFixes #[issue-number-from-original-issue]\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Consider improving langversion diagnostics for \"unsafe in iterators\" feature</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>There are some confusing diagnostics where \"feature is not supported in C# 12\" is reported but if you upgrade to C# 13, you get an error \"pointers must be used in unsafe context\". It would be better if the latter error has been reported in C# 12 as well. This happens because unsafe/safe contexts changed slightly between C# 12 and 13, so in C# 12 the compiler thinks we are in unsafe context and you just need to upgrade to C# 13, but in C# 13 we are suddenly in safe context, so you get the unsafe error. For example:\r\n> \r\n> ```cs\r\n> unsafe class C\r\n> {\r\n>     System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M()\r\n>     {\r\n>         int* p = null; // langversion error in C# 12; unsafe error in C# 13\r\n>         yield break;\r\n>     }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Similarly, there can be errors in C# 12 saying a construct (e.g., await or pointer) is not supported in an unsafe context. But if you upgrade to C# 13, that feature works since the context becomes safe. It would be better if we reported a langversion error in C# 12 (i.e., error saying \"feature is not supported in C# 12\", so users know they can just upgrade to make the error scenario work). For example:\r\n> \r\n> ```cs\r\n> unsafe class C\r\n> {\r\n>     System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M()\r\n>     {\r\n>         var lam = () => sizeof(nint); // unsafe error in C# 12; works in C# 13\r\n>         yield break;\r\n>     }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Lastly, there are some unnecessary diagnostics in C# 12 where you get an error for every unsafe construct in an unsafe block inside an iterator even though you already got that error for the unsafe block itself, so the nested errors are just noise. Note that this is a preexisting behavior, only previously the errors said \"cannot use unsafe in iterators\" and now they say \"unsafe in iterators is not supported in C# 12\". They disappear completely in C# 13. Still, we could filter them out in C# 12, but that is tricky because we do not know if we are inside an unsafe block in an iterator (see `M1` below) or if the unsafe context is just inherited from parent (in which case we cannot filter out the errors; see `M2` below). For example:\r\n> \r\n> ```cs\r\n> unsafe class C\r\n> {\r\n>     System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M1()\r\n>     {\r\n>         unsafe // langversion error in C# 12\r\n>         {\r\n>             int* p; // unnecessary langversion error in C# 12\r\n>         }\r\n>         yield break;\r\n>     }\r\n>     System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M2()\r\n>     {\r\n>         int* p; // necessary langversion error in C# 12\r\n>         yield break;\r\n>     }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> All of these could be solved by e.g., having separate BinderFlags for \"unsafe region in C# 12\" and \"unsafe region in C# 13\" that we could use in the compiler to decide which diagnostics to report. However, BinderFlags is `uint` currently and does not have any free slots.\r\n> \r\n> Note: this issue will be referenced in tests (via https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73046).\r\n> \r\n> Related to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72662.</issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\n\nFixes dotnet/roslyn#73280\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80650","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Improve langversion diagnostics for \"unsafe in iterators\" feature\" (#80650)"},{"Id":"3504066791","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T22:57:26","Actor":"JoeRobich","Number":"80641","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build BuildHost against net8.0","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80641","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Build BuildHost against net8.0\" (#80641)"},{"Id":"3504655327","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T22:30:07","Actor":"jhinder","Number":"80648","RawContent":null,"Title":"Private extension methods are shown as null-unaware","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: VS 18.0.0 Insiders [11109.219]\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\nShow the quick info tooltip on each of the extension method invocations.\n```csharp\n#nullable enable\nstatic class Cx\n{\n    public static void M()\n    {\n        \"\".M1().M2().M3();\n    }\n\n    extension<T> (T s)\n    {\n        private T M1() => s;\n        internal T M2() => s;\n        public T M3() => s;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\nAs all extensions are declared in a nullable context, neither should show that is \"not nullable aware\".\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n* Hovering over `M1()` shows the signature and the notice \"'M1' is not nullable aware.\"\n* Hovering over `M2()` and `M3()` shows the signature and no such notice.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80648","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Private extension methods are shown as null-unaware\" (#80648)"},{"Id":"3504605568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T21:58:20","Actor":"jhinder","Number":"80645","RawContent":null,"Title":"Extension blocks: extension method called from constructor is marked as unused","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: VS 18.0.0 Insiders [11109.219]\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\nObserve the method declaration for `M`.\n```csharp\nstatic class D\n{\n    class C\n    {\n        public C()\n        {\n            this.M();\n        }\n    }\n\n    extension (C c)\n    {\n        private void M()\n        {\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\nSince the method is used, it is not marked as unused.\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\nThe method M is greyed out and IDE0051 is reported.

The task runs for every TFM of every C# project, and was always extracting and comparing MVIDs from both source and destination assemblies, even when the files were identical.\n\n## Solution\n\nFollowing @jjonescz's suggestion, this PR implements a size and timestamp check before MVID extraction, similar to how MSBuild's standard `Copy` task works:\n\n1. **Fast path**: If both file size and last write timestamp match, the copy is skipped immediately\n2. **Fallback**: If size or timestamp differ, the existing MVID-based comparison continues as before\n\n```csharp\n// Fast path: check size and timestamp first to avoid expensive MVID extraction\nvar sourceInfo = new FileInfo(SourcePath);\nvar destInfo = new FileInfo(DestinationPath);\n\nif (sourceInfo.Length == destInfo.Length &&\n    sourceInfo.LastWriteTimeUtc == destInfo.LastWriteTimeUtc)\n{\n    Log.LogMessageFromResources(MessageImportance.Low, \"CopyRefAssembly_SkippingCopy1\", DestinationPath);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Performance**: Avoids opening files and reading assembly metadata when files haven't changed\n- **Scalability**: The optimization compounds across all TFMs and projects in a build\n- **Correctness**: Maintains the same behavior when files actually differ - MVID checking still occurs when needed\n- **Safety**: Wrapped in try-catch to gracefully fall back to MVID checking if any errors occur\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded comprehensive test coverage:\n- `SourceAndDestinationWithSameSizeAndTimestamp` - Validates the new fast-path optimization\n- `SourceAndDestinationWithSameMvidButDifferentTimestamp` - Ensures MVID checking still works correctly\n- `PerformanceComparison_SizeTimestampCheckVsMvidCheck` - Demonstrates that the fast path is significantly faster than MVID extraction (typically 10-20x improvement)\n- Updated existing tests to use direct timestamp manipulation instead of `Thread.Sleep` for deterministic and faster test execution\n\nAll 8 CopyRefAssembly tests pass (378 tests total in the MSBuildTaskTests suite).\n\nFixes dotnet/roslyn#80611\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>`CopyRefAssembly` Task takes quite a long time even on incremental builds</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: .NET SDK 9.0.305\n> \n> <img width=\"754\" height=\"460\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68766779-2fad-4820-a3a9-dc241468c973\" />\n> \n> When analyzing an incremental build for a partner team, the `CopyRefAssembly` Task stood out for causing a significant amount of time across the build overall.\n> \n> This Task is called fully for every TFM of every C# project even on incremental builds, so anything that can be done to optimize it accrues quite nicely.\n> </issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Follow @jjonescz's suggestion - update the CopyRefAssembly Task to check if the size/timestamp of the source and destination files are equivalent in order to short-circuit before performing mvid-based checking.

You would end up with a .NET tool package that only worked correctly on systems that matched the RuntimeIdentifier.\n\nIn .NET 10, we added support for [RID-specific .NET Tools](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/10.0/preview/preview6/sdk.md#platform-specific-net-tools).  This creates RID-agnostic primary package in an outer build and RID-specific packages in inner builds for each RuntimeIdentifier.\n\nAs a side effect of this, it's no longer easily possible to create a tool that is compiled for a single RuntimeIdentifier but that creates a normal tool package.  When the RuntimeIdentifier is specified in a tool build, the RID-specific tool logic kicks in as it would in a tool inner build and creates a package where the RuntimeIdentifier is part of the ID.\n\nWe should add a way to opt out of the RID-specific inner build logic in order to be able to have the same behavior as previously.\n\nWe should also update the [breaking change notice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/10.0/dotnet-tool-pack-publish) to cover the `RuntimeIdentifier` property in addition to `RuntimeIdentifiers`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't create non RID-specific tool package if compiling with RuntimeIdentifier set\" (#51199)"},{"Id":"3504298900","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T19:49:12","Actor":"nagilson","Number":"51197","RawContent":null,"Title":"SSL Template Issue Causes Missing OSX Templates","State":"closed","Body":"## Build Information\nBuild: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng-public/cbb18261-c48f-4abb-8651-8cdcb5474649/_build/results?buildId=1169999\nBuild error leg or test failing: Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.New.IntegrationTests.DotnetNewDetailsTest.CanDisplayDetails_RemotePackage_NuGetFeedNoVersion\nPull request: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/51187\n<!-- Error message template  -->\n## Error Message\n\nFill the error message using [step by step known issues guidance](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/Projects/Build%20Analysis/KnownIssueJsonStepByStep.md).\n\n<!-- Use ErrorMessage for String.Contains matches.

Your report may be eligible for our bug bounty but ONLY if it is reported through email.\nFor other types of questions, consider using StackOverflow.\n-->\n\n### Describe the bug\nWhen a Blazor Web App component uses `@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly` with `[PersistentState(AllowUpdates = true)]`, enhanced navigation ignores the persisted snapshot. Navigating back to the page causes the WASM instance to rerun `OnInitializedAsync`, regenerate data, and overwrite the server-provided value—even though the initial hydration works. Full reloads (`forceLoad: true`) or `@rendermode InteractiveServer` preserve state correctly.\n\n### To Reproduce\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/CoCoNuTeK/-PersistentState-AllowUpdates-true-issue-when-InteractiveWebAssembly.git\ncd -PersistentState-AllowUpdates-true-issue-when-InteractiveWebAssembly/PersistenceStateIssue\ndotnet run\n```\n\n1. Open `http://localhost:5041/persist-demo-b` in Chrome with DevTools open.\n2. Observe initial console output, for example:\n   ```\n   [PersistDemoB] Skipping random value generation because state already contains '39'.\n   [PersistDemoA] No persisted random value found. Simulating load before generating a new value.\n   [PersistDemoA] Generated random value '72'.\n   [PersistDemoB] No persisted random value found. Simulating load before generating a new value.\n   [PersistDemoB] Generated random value '25'.\n   ```\n3. Use the on-page buttons (which call `NavigateTo(..., forceLoad: false)`) to switch between `/persist-demo-a` and `/persist-demo-b`.\n4. Each enhanced navigation triggers another execution of `OnInitializedAsync` in the WASM instance and generates a new random value, despite the Network tab showing the prerender and `[PersistentState(AllowUpdates = true)]` being present.\n5. Setting `forceLoad: true` avoids the issue but removes enhanced navigation.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\nNone.\n\n### Further technical details\n<details>\n<summary>details of dotnet --info</summary>\n\n```\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n Version:   10.0.100-rc.1.24452.12 (arm64)\n OS Name:   macOS\n OS Version: 14.xx (Sonoma)\n RID:       osx-arm64\n```\n\n</details>\n\n- IDE: Visual Studio Code Version: \n1.104.3\nCommit: 385651c938df8a906869babee516bffd0ddb9829\nDate: 2025-10-02T12:30:51.747Z\nElectron: 37.3.1\nElectronBuildId: 12404162\nChromium: 138.0.7204.235\nNode.js: 22.18.0\nV8: 13.8.258.31-electron.0\nOS: Darwin arm64 24.6.0\n\nRepro repository: https://github.com/CoCoNuTeK/-PersistentState-AllowUpdates-true-issue-when-InteractiveWebAssembly\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51196","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blazor [PersistentState(AllowUpdates = true)] issue with @rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly\" (#51196)"},{"Id":"3501932312","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T19:29:38","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"51191","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0.3xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:75c4fc27-6ecc-4034-8836-2e455df40818)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/templating\n- **Subscription**: [75c4fc27-6ecc-4034-8836-2e455df40818](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=75c4fc27-6ecc-4034-8836-2e455df40818)\n- **Build**: [20251010.14](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2812647) ([286486](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/6417/github:dotnet:templating/build/286486))\n- **Date Produced**: October 10, 2025 9:42:34 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: [96bad0d3e0e43c50bdb3e93efc9520724677b22a](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/commit/96bad0d3e0e43c50bdb3e93efc9520724677b22a)\n- **Branch**: [release/9.0.3xx](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/tree/release/9.0.3xx)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - From [9.0.306 to 9.0.307][2]\n     - Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Abstractions\n  - From [9.0.111-servicing.25465.7 to 9.0.307-servicing.25510.14][2]\n     - Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Mocks\n\n[2]: https://github.com/dotnet/templating/compare/79d6a45326...96bad0d3e0\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:75c4fc27-6ecc-4034-8836-2e455df40818)\n\n\n\n\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/51191","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/9.0.3xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating\" (#51191)"},{"Id":"3501813724","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-10T18:32:08","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"51188","RawContent":null,"Title":"Localized file check-in by OneLocBuild Task: Build definition ID 140: Build ID 2812555","State":"closed","Body":"This is the pull request automatically created by the OneLocBuild task in the build process to check-in localized files generated based upon translation source files (.lcl files) handed-back from the downstream localization pipeline.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0  Runtime or .NET 9.0.100 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

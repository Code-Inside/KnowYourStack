It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

This was *terrible* for performance, but it allowed us to still run in 32bits.  \r\n\r\nThe IDE has not used this in *many* years (since VS moved to 64bit).  Looking online (github search), i can't find any usages of this api either.  \r\n\r\nNote: this API cannot be used to persist data to a stream that is then read in in a *later* session.  Nor can it be used for *cross process* communication.  This is because the 'object reading/writing' system keeps references to *in memory* data in the bytes it writes out.  Specifically, it keeps arrays of \"registered System.Types\" in memory, and then writes out indices into that array.  That array isn't deterministically created.  It will change from VS session to session, and will be not be the same in VS and in our OOP process.\r\n\r\nAs such, this API exists *solely* for a host to write things to memory mapped files, and only read it back within the same session.  In other words, it only exists for that exact use case we had in roslyn when we were 32 bit.\r\n\r\nGiven that we're not 32bit, are not using this anymore, and there are no usages of this in the wild, i recommend deprecating this API.  Currently, we have to have complexity in a lot of places to support it, and it accounts for ~20k lines of code we ship: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70277\r\n\r\nRemoving this will be a nice savings in metadata and IL, and it will allow us to simplify a bunch of our serialization system.  Specifically, our serializtion system will not have to have an object registration system anymore.  It can just be about types writing out their contents in an explicit fashion (which needs no type registration).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deprecate syntax serialization logic.\" (#70275)"},{"Id":"1930675119","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T17:26:21","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"70274","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP - Demonstrate removing syntax reading/writing from streams.","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70274","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP - Demonstrate removing syntax reading/writing from streams.\" (#70274)"},{"Id":"1930603482","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T16:45:09","Actor":"cston","Number":"70273","RawContent":null,"Title":"[17.8] Collection expressions: merge changes for conversions and optimizations","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70273","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[17.8] Collection expressions: merge changes for conversions and optimizations\" (#70273)"},{"Id":"1930577288","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T16:20:51","Actor":"andrewlock","Number":"70272","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot build deeply nested hierarchies with .NET 8 RC 1 SDK (e.g. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Odata)","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs and feature requests.\r\n\r\nIf you believe you have an issue that affects the SECURITY of the platform, please do NOT create an issue and instead email your issue details to secure@microsoft.com.

Instead the build hangs for 45+ mins(forever?)\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nI've attached the repro project - this compiles quickly with the .NET 7 SDK, but never (effectively) with the .NET 8 SDK. The problem appears to be around deeply nested class hierarchies, which are present in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Odata](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData) library.\r\n\r\n[DeepNestedHierarchy.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/files/12821015/DeepNestedHierarchy.zip)\r\n\r\nAs a further test I tried to build the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData](https://github.com/OData/AspNetCoreOData) project itself using the .NET 8 SDK and I see the exact same problem.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nN/A - it spins forever\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Using <code>8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5</code>.

If the issue was customer-reported, that's good to note here.)\r\n\r\n**Regression?**: It is a regression for WinForms .NET Designer but not for .NET SDK. It got regressed in VS 17.3 release. In the designer, earlier we were copying all the files present in project output directory to designer's shadow cache folder and hence the designer's server process was able to load these dlls. But we got perf complaints for large projects having lots of dlls in their project output. So, we started copying only the files returned by `DesignerRuntimeImplementationProjectOutputGroup`. But due to this bug the output group was not including `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref` runtime pack assemblies for which `RuntimePackAlwaysCopyLocal` metadata was set to true. This bug was always present in the output group.\r\n\r\nRisk (see [taxonomy](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_wiki/wikis/DevDiv.wiki/545/NET-Servicing?anchor=pr-template#risk-taxonomy))\r\n\r\n**Link the PR to the original issue and to the PR to main.**\r\n\r\nOriginal issue: https://github.com/microsoft/winforms-designer/issues/5400\r\nPR to main: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35835\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note any packaging impact:** No Impact. \r\n\r\n**Note any ref pack impact.** (Touches files contained in Microsoft.NETCore.App.Ref, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref, or Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App.Ref.): No Impact.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35907","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/8.0.1xx] Including RuntimePackAsset in DesignerRuntimeImplementationProjectOutputGroup\" (#35907)"},{"Id":"1930119259","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T12:51:09","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"35905","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.2xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/razor","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:b54096ff-39d3-4c32-4188-08dbc5cb7800)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/razor\r\n- **Subscription**: b54096ff-39d3-4c32-4188-08dbc5cb7800\r\n- **Build**: 20231004.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: October 4, 2023 6:06:58 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 8de09384414b0f850b29991342b4c40c423a8b40\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/dev17.8\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.Extensions.Tooling.Internal**: [from 7.0.0-preview.23471.1 to 7.0.0-preview.23504.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Razor.Tooling.Internal**: [from 7.0.0-preview.23471.1 to 7.0.0-preview.23504.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor.SourceGenerators.Transport**: [from 7.0.0-preview.23471.1 to 7.0.0-preview.23504.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/razor/compare/cf76071cbd...8de0938441\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:b54096ff-39d3-4c32-4188-08dbc5cb7800)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35905","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/8.0.2xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/razor\" (#35905)"},{"Id":"1930117997","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T12:50:33","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"35902","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.2xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/command-line-api","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ffe3906e-d436-4618-f9c8-08dbc5cb1bdd)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api\r\n- **Subscription**: ffe3906e-d436-4618-f9c8-08dbc5cb1bdd\r\n- **Build**: 20230807.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 7, 2023 4:34:26 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: a045dd54a4c44723c215d992288160eb1401bb7f\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.command-line-api**: [from 0.1.430701 to 0.1.440701][1]\r\n  - **System.CommandLine**: [from 2.0.0-beta4.23307.1 to 2.0.0-beta4.23407.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/compare/02fe27cd6a...a045dd54a4\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:ffe3906e-d436-4618-f9c8-08dbc5cb1bdd)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35902","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/8.0.2xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/command-line-api\" (#35902)"},{"Id":"1929612955","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-06T07:40:33","Actor":"zcxsythenew","Number":"35891","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update GivenThatWeWantToPublishAFrameworkDependentApp.cs to fix chars…","State":"open","Body":"…et error.\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses Issue #33819 .\r\n\r\nWhen I run `build.cmd` on Windows 11 in Chinese environment, I reproduced the above issue.

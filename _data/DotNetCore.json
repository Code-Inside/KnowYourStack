All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system)\r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project)\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu)\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness)\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker)\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools)\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf)\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**. When you go to the original repository, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Update local

default interface methods (#25770)","State":"open","Body":"- Partial port of https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/25770 to 3.1 (only the main change, excludes unrelated cleanup)\r\n- Use native code slot for default interface methods so that `MethodDesc::GetNativeCode()` can retrieve the current native code entry point (instead of returning null as before), and code versioning can find a matching code version from the code start address\r\n- Interface methods currently require having a precode, so the \"method entry point\" can't be used to directly store the native code entry point\r\n- Reenabled a couple of default interface method tests under GCStress\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/25690\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nMostly only affects some GCStress tests. The change can have harmless non-test effects, for example a default interface method may be jitted redundantly fewer times after the change (as expected), since before the change the call to `GetNativeCode()` here would always return null for a default interface method and the method may be jitted again unnecessarily.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/867aa5e1141c8801796a80171a3749d944c6b9af/src/vm/codeversion.cpp#L2304-L2309\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the main purpose of the port is to fix some GCStress tests to make CI runs more reliable and useful for testing other fixes made to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nVerified that several tests under GCStress are fixed after the change on Windows arm64 where the issues were seen.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- The change has been in all of the 5.0 releases\r\n- The change makes tracking of the native code for default interface methods similar to other methods that have a precode and don't have a stable entry point, so the behavior would be more consistent with other types of methods\r\n- The native code slot for default interface methods is a pointer-size extra memory per such method, it wouldn't be significant as the number of such methods is typically low compared to other types of methods, and most other methods already use a native code slot","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28153","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Use native code slot for default interface methods (#25770)\" (#28153)"},{"Id":"816912779","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-26T16:57:01","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28151","RawContent":null,"Title":"update branding to 3.1.14","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update branding to 3.1.14\" (#28151)"},{"Id":"816913038","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-26T16:56:56","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28152","RawContent":null,"Title":"update branding to 2.1.27","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update branding to 2.1.27\" (#28152)"},{"Id":"810807167","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-02-18T06:35:54","Actor":"hoyosjs","Number":"28150","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix lazy machine state unwinding for MSVC epilogues on x86","State":"open","Body":"# Description\r\n\r\nMSVC introduced changes into their prologue/epilogue helpers. Particularly `_EH_prolog3_catch_GS_align`/`_EH_epilog3_GS_align` had a `mov esp, ebx` instruction the lazy unwinding didn't handle.

This manifests as GC holes where the stack walking caused the GC to not find stack roots, effectively unrooting object with references in the stack. A customer reported this from their use of `Debug.WriteLine` .\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with respect to previous releases.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

It encrypted the plainText variable successfully.\r\n`\r\n\r\n           string plainText = \"123\";\r\n            byte[] encrypted = null;\r\n            byte[][] keys = KeyHelper.GetHashKeys(\"230DK49FK59EK\");\r\n            var aesAlg = new AesCryptoServiceProvider { Key = keys[0], IV = keys[1] };\r\n\r\n            // Create an encryptor to perform the stream transform.\r\n            var encryptor = aesAlg.CreateEncryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);\r\n\r\n            // Create the streams used for encryption.\r\n            using (var msEncrypt = new MemoryStream())\r\n            {\r\n                using (var csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))\r\n                {\r\n                    using (var swEncrypt = new StreamWriter(csEncrypt))\r\n                    {\r\n                        //Write all data to the stream.\r\n                        swEncrypt.Write(plainText);\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    encrypted = msEncrypt.ToArray();\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Return the encrypted bytes from the memory stream.\r\n            return Convert.ToBase64String(encrypted);`\r\n2. When I change all the 3 \"using statement\" to \"using declarations\", it doesn't work, return empty string.\r\n`\r\n\r\n           string plainText = \"123\";\r\n            byte[] encrypted = null;\r\n            byte[][] keys = KeyHelper.GetHashKeys(\"230DK49FK59EK\");\r\n            var aesAlg = new AesCryptoServiceProvider { Key = keys[0], IV = keys[1] };\r\n\r\n            // Create an encryptor to perform the stream transform.\r\n            var encryptor = aesAlg.CreateEncryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);\r\n\r\n            // Create the streams used for encryption.\r\n            using var msEncrypt = new MemoryStream();\r\n            using var csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write);\r\n            using var swEncrypt = new StreamWriter(csEncrypt);\r\n            //Write all data to the stream.\r\n            swEncrypt.Write(plainText);\r\n\r\n            encrypted = msEncrypt.ToArray();\r\n\r\n            // Return the encrypted bytes from the memory stream.\r\n            return Convert.ToBase64String(encrypted);`\r\n3. For the 2nd code, if I change the 3rd \"using declaration\" to be \"using statement\", it works.\r\n`\r\n\r\n           string plainText = \"123\";\r\n            byte[] encrypted = null;\r\n            byte[][] keys = KeyHelper.GetHashKeys(\"230DK49FK59EK\");\r\n            var aesAlg = new AesCryptoServiceProvider { Key = keys[0], IV = keys[1] };\r\n\r\n            // Create an encryptor to perform the stream transform.\r\n            var encryptor = aesAlg.CreateEncryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);\r\n\r\n            // Create the streams used for encryption.\r\n            using var msEncrypt = new MemoryStream();\r\n            using var csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write);\r\n            using (var swEncrypt = new StreamWriter(csEncrypt))\r\n            {\r\n                //Write all data to the stream.\r\n                swEncrypt.Write(plainText);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            encrypted = msEncrypt.ToArray();\r\n\r\n            // Return the encrypted bytes from the memory stream.\r\n            return Convert.ToBase64String(encrypted);`\r\n4. Here's the GetHashKeys function I was using:\r\n`\r\n\r\n           var result = new byte[2][];\r\n            var enc = Encoding.UTF8;\r\n\r\n            using (SHA256 sha2 = new SHA256CryptoServiceProvider())\r\n            {\r\n                var rawKey = enc.GetBytes(key);\r\n                var rawIV = enc.GetBytes(key);\r\n\r\n                var hashKey = sha2.ComputeHash(rawKey);\r\n                var hashIV = sha2.ComputeHash(rawIV);\r\n\r\n                Array.Resize(ref hashIV, 16);\r\n\r\n                result[0] = hashKey;\r\n                result[1] = hashIV;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return result;`\r\n**Expected Behavior**: 2nd code should have same behavior with 1st code.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**: 2nd code is returning empty string.\r\n\r\nCan you please tell me why? I'm not sure if this is a bug. And I'm not sure if I should post the question in here or in dotnet/runtime, because it might not be a compiler issue, or StreamWriter's issue.

When I'm in a directory it might not be immediately obvious if there are multiple projects. Would I prefer to go back to put the project between `list` and `package` ? Or would I like to provide it at the end of the previous invocation with `--project <project>` ? Probably the latter.\r\n\r\nLike I already mentioned I've never seen this way of structuring commands anywhere else, hence \"unnatural\". Adding on top, the provided tab completion (`dotnet complete`) doesn't even gracefully handle this case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ls *.csproj\r\nA.csproj B.csproj\r\n\r\n$ dotnet complete \"dotnet add \"\r\n--help\r\n-h\r\npackage\r\nreference\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo since there are two projects, it should probably suggest these projects instead of `package` and `reference`. But even if that was the case, this is completely breaking muscle memory.\r\n\r\nFrom the Twitter conversation, I understand that backward-compatibility is an issue. @KathleenDollard suggested (if I understand correctly), to allow `--project <project>` as an additional option, which I would be happy with.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16248","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Structure of CLI commands\" (#16248)"},{"Id":"824948748","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-08T21:01:02","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"16247","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn-analyzers","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:215b0dae-fb2b-4111-b5ae-08d896fa00f1)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers\r\n- **Subscription**: 215b0dae-fb2b-4111-b5ae-08d896fa00f1\r\n- **Build**: 20210308.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/8/2021 5:31 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 940c426fb70c2a5c9c77cd92d714ae8d36e81d3e\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/6.0.1xx-preview3\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers**: [from 6.0.0-preview3.21153.3 to 6.0.0-preview3.21158.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/compare/c054652...940c426\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:215b0dae-fb2b-4111-b5ae-08d896fa00f1)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16247","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn-analyzers\" (#16247)"},{"Id":"824930540","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-08T20:36:42","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"16246","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87\r\n- **Build**: 20210309.15\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/10/2021 1:00 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 57250ccad18e34d844a5299bfa2e9f0a8cb9e826\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Runtime.win-x64**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref.Internal**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Analyzers**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **dotnet-user-secrets**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **dotnet-dev-certs**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Razor**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **VS.Redist.Common.AspNetCore.SharedFramework.x64.6.0**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.Language**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Analyzers**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.Extensions**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Api.Analyzers**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Analyzers**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.DeveloperCertificates.XPlat**: [from 6.0.0-preview.3.21158.2 to 6.0.0-preview.3.21159.15][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/compare/d84637d...57250cc\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16246","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore\" (#16246)"},{"Id":"824831158","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-08T18:24:51","Actor":"aaronla-ms","Number":"16244","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature Request: support for nuget package consumption in framework-less projects","State":"open","Body":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nDetailed in issue https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/6210\r\n\r\nPresently, nuget client errors out during `dotnet restore` if a user's project does not specify either TargetFramework or TargetFrameworks.

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\r\n\r\nExploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Core. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core checks the source markup of a file.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2425\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application running on .NET Core 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core.

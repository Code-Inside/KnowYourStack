It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)"},{"Id":"34690129145","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:54","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/292","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\" (#292) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA Denial of Service vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core project templates which utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. \r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/**TBD**.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nThis impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of project templates listed in [affected software](#affected-software). \r\nOther project templates e.g., console applications, MAUI applications, Windows Forms or WPF applications, are not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nThis impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of the below project templates.\r\n\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web API\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)\r\n-\tBlazor Server App\r\n-\tBlazor WebAssembly App\r\n\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you are you using project templates listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you may be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### For existing projects:\r\nIf you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -> New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. \r\n- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/) \r\n- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/) \r\n\r\nIf your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n#### For new projects:\r\nTo remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   7.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 76.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  7.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.101 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install .NET SDK 7.0.115 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install .NET SDK 6.0.321 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0, .NET 7.0, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43141","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix ReadOnlySequence created out of sliced Memory owned by MemoryManager\" (#43141)"},{"Id":"1224389900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:24:35","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.26","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43143","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.26\" (#43143)"},{"Id":"1202264239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T04:53:34","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43142)"},{"Id":"1193653850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:51:59","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Roslyn-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2130976136","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T00:25:49","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"72063","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use collection expressions in IDE code.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72063","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use collection expressions in IDE code.\" (#72063)"},{"Id":"2131019967","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-13T00:18:49","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"72068","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add tests validating behavior","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72068","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add tests validating behavior\" (#72068)"},{"Id":"2131154177","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T23:13:32","Actor":"ArchieCoder","Number":"72076","RawContent":null,"Title":"Exception from Visual Studio while coding","State":"open","Body":"Latest VS version.

The registered callback will then be called on every node with that kind in a particular file.\r\n\r\nHowever, analyzers then need to often check if their particular options would disable their processing for a particular file.  Given that there may be a large number of nodes of a particular kind in a file, this means calling back both on all those nodes, and then having all those nodes have to check the same option over and over again to see if it's disabled.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if we could avoid all that work by giving analyzers a point to first check if they are disabled for a particular file.  We can accomplish that with a pattern we have for the other types of actions:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic abstract class AnalysisContext\r\n{\r\n+     public abstract void RegisterSyntaxNodeStartAction(Action<SyntaxNodeStartAnalysisContext> action);\r\n}\r\n\r\n+public abstract class SyntaxNodeStartAnalysisContext\r\n+{\r\n+    public SyntaxTree SyntaxTree { get; }\r\n+    public Compilation Compilation { get; }\r\n+    public AnalyzerOptions Options { get; }\r\n+    public CancellationToken CancellationToken { get; }\r\n\r\n+    public void RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(Action<SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext> action, params TLanguageKindEnum[] syntaxKinds);\r\n+    public abstract void RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(Action<SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext> action, ImmutableArray<TLanguageKindEnum> syntaxKinds);\r\n+}\r\n\r\npublic abstract class CompilationStartAnalysisContext\r\n{\r\n+     public abstract void RegisterSyntaxNodeStartAction(Action<SyntaxNodeStartAnalysisContext> action);\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis would then be used by our own analyzers like so:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n    protected override void InitializeWorker(AnalysisContext context)\r\n        => context.RegisterSyntaxNodeStartAction(context =>\r\n        {\r\n            var option = context.GetCSharpAnalyzerOptions().FeatureXXXOption;\r\n            if (ShouldSkipAnalysis(context, option))\r\n                return;\r\n\r\n             context.RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(ProcessSyntaxNode, SyntaxKind.xxx);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n// Or, also commonly:\r\n\r\n    protected override void InitializeWorker(AnalysisContext context)\r\n        => context.RegisterCompilationStartAction(context =>\r\n        {\r\n            // Feature not available before C#8\r\n            if (context.Compilation.LanguageVersion() < LanguageVersion.CSharp8)\r\n                return;\r\n\r\n            context.RegisterSyntaxNodeStartAction(context =>\r\n            {\r\n                var option = context.GetCSharpAnalyzerOptions().FeatureXXXOption;\r\n                if (ShouldSkipAnalysis(context, option))\r\n                    return;\r\n\r\n                 context.RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(ProcessSyntaxNode, SyntaxKind.xxx);\r\n             });\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this, we'll now only get the syntax node callbacks for files that we should actually be scanning.\r\n\r\nNote: such a pattern is so common we might consider an extension (or IDE level method) to do allow you to write:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n    protected override void InitializeWorker(AnalysisContext context)\r\n        => context.RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(\r\n            minLanguageVersion: LanguageVersion.CSharp8,\r\n            analyzerOptions => analyzerOptions.FeatureXXXOption,\r\n            ProcessSyntaxNode,\r\n            SyntaxKind.Etcs);\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis would now be the optimal way to register a feature to work on nodes, while knowing it would have virtually no runtime impact if hte langversion were too low, or if the file was excluded from analysis.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNote: from talking to @mavasani, we think calling this `RegisterSyntaxTreeStartAction` or `RegisterSemanticModelStartAction` may be more appropriate.  I'm fine either way.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72053","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add RegisterSyntaxNodeStartAction to allow analyzers to immediately bail out from analyzing a file prior to processing nodes.\" (#72053)"},{"Id":"2129135711","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-11T21:49:39","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"72050","RawContent":null,"Title":"Only walk into nodes with directives when processing tree for nullable directives.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72050","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Only walk into nodes with directives when processing tree for nullable directives.\" (#72050)"},{"Id":"2129179330","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-11T21:34:02","Actor":"AdamWillden","Number":"72052","RawContent":null,"Title":"IDE0270 - Cannot simplify for nullable implicit casts","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**:  Version 17.9.0 Preview 4.0\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\nI stumbled across this bug, I'm not sure what I'm doing is a good idea but reporting the bug nevertheless!\r\n\r\n[sharplab.io](https://sharplab.io/#v2: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)\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n```c#\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Text.Json;\r\nusing System.Threading;\r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n\r\npublic interface IStatePersistence\r\n{\r\n    Task<State> ResolveAsync(\r\n        string handle,\r\n        CancellationToken cancellationToken);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic enum StateType\r\n{\r\n    None,\r\n    Auth,\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic record State(\r\n    StateType Type,\r\n    byte[] Value)\r\n{\r\n    //  can't throw within implicit cast, so must return nullable:\r\n    public static implicit operator UserAuthenticationState?(\r\n        State state)\r\n    {\r\n        return JsonSerializer\r\n            .Deserialize<UserAuthenticationState>(\r\n                state.Value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic record UserAuthenticationState(\r\n    string? blah);\r\n\r\npublic class UseCase\r\n{\r\n    private readonly IStatePersistence _statePersistence;\r\n    \r\n    public UseCase(\r\n        IStatePersistence statePersistence)\r\n    {\r\n        _statePersistence = statePersistence;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public async Task<UserAuthenticationState> Method(\r\n        string handle,\r\n        CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n    {\r\n        // Must be nullable here\r\n        UserAuthenticationState? state\r\n            = await _statePersistence\r\n                .ResolveAsync(\r\n                    handle,\r\n                    cancellationToken);\r\n\r\n        if (state == null)\r\n        {\r\n            throw new Exception();\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        return state;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Diagnostic Id**: IDE0270\r\n\r\n**Expected Behaviour**: IDE0270 error is not present\r\n\r\n**Actual Behaviour**: IDE0270 is present, if I follow instructions it retains `UserAuthenticationState?` which is required for the implicit cast.

This allows installation of packages as part of an unsigned preview release. The issue is that, when an install fails due to a missing package (another issue to be raised), workloads are left in an unusable state despite the workload tool claiming to have performed a rollback of actions.\r\n\r\nTo fix the situation, I would expect to be able to use `dotnet workload uninstall [workload]` or `dotnet workload clean -all` to remove the offending packages, and install non-preview versions by specifying the default nuget package source instead of the dev one. Unfortunately, this is not an options as the installed workloads fail a signature check and removal is not allowed to proceed.\r\n\r\nThis could be remedied by providing a similar flag that enables signature checking to be skipped as on the `dotnet workload install` command with the `--skip-sign-check` flag.\r\n\r\nWithout such an option, I am currently unable to use any of the affected workloads reliably until either the missing package appears in the dev repo, or a change the the behaviour of the `dotnet workload` tool has been made.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/38681","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to install, update or clean unsigned preview workloads reliably.\" (#38681)"},{"Id":"2128536531","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-12T09:54:25","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"38677","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from nuget/nuget.client","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:fcb199f6-ff33-44a0-f3ef-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client\r\n- **Subscription**: fcb199f6-ff33-44a0-f3ef-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 6.10.0.32\r\n- **Date Produced**: February 10, 2024 2:09:22 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 8b658e2eee6391936887b9fd1b39f7918d16a9cb\r\n- **Branch**: dev\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BinaryFormatter is being removed in .NET 9\" (#293)"},{"Id":"2072888869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:52","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"292","RawContent":null,"Title":" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96700\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner.

Vulnerabilities in .NET and similar products are scored with this advice in mind. The score for your implementation this product may not be as severe, however we recommend installing the update as soon as possible in an abundance of caution.\r\n\r\nAt the time this vulnerability report was published, the assessed CVSS score was 9.1. The full list of metrics can be found at https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-0057 (Opens in new window or tab).\r\n\r\nIn our assessment of this vulnerability, while .NET-based applications are not by default subject to this attack, we recognize that some applications may reasonably make authentication decisions based on the return values of the impacted API. We consider the ease of exploit and likely consequences to applications written in this manner.\r\n\r\nWe will at a future date share more detailed information about how we assess vulnerabilities against a reasonable worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.9 or SDK 7.0.109 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.20 or SDK 6.0.315 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n* If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1 and consuming the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity package, update that package to version [2.1.39](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/2.1.39)\r\n.NET 6.0 and and .NET 7.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update.

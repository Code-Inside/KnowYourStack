The problem is EXACTLY what the OP states.  The code formatter does NOT put a leading space before the open angle bracket.  Yes, this does happen if you run “autoformat code on paste”.  It also happens if you use the keyboard or menu bar to format the code.</p>\n<p>There is literally no more information you can possible need or get about this problem.  If Microsoft is too lazy to fix one line of code in the code fomatter, then at least have the honesty to admit you are not going to fix it because you don’t want to rather than you just don’t understand what the problem is and you need more information to figure it out.</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s refusal to even attempt to fix bugs in Visual Studio is exactly why VS gets a bad rap.  If a customer takes the time to hand you a bug on a silver platter, the least you can do is attempt to fix it instead of trying everything to weasle out of scheduling a bug fix.</p>\n<p>This is literally a one-minute fix.  If I had access to the Visual Studio code base I’d have it fixed already.  It cannot be hard to change the rule from “zero spaces before angle bracket” to “one space before angle bracket”.  You have spent way more time trying to get out of addressing this bug than it would take for one of your developers to actually fix it.</p>\n<p>The worst thing a software company can do is play games with its bug tracking to make it look like there are fewer bugs by having them returned for fradulant reasons rather than fixing the bug.  And using an automated closure system to get rid of the report of a bug you don’t want to fix is quite shady.  It does not instill confidence in you customers.</p>\n<p>This bug was literally posted seven months ago and you couldn’t find any time in the past half year to fix one line of code?  This is ridiculous.</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 7/11/2025, 04:53 PM: \n\n<p>This issue is currently being investigated.

For example, the line of code\n    int value = SomeFunction &lt;int&gt; (someParameter);\ngets reformatted as\n    int value = SomeFunction&lt;int&gt; (someParameter);\n\nThis is incorrect.  It is objectively wrong to not put a space before the &lt; punctionation mark.  If you want to allow people to opt-into the wrong way of formatting the code, then fine, but don't force the wrong way onto people.\n\nThere is no option in C# format spacing to include a leading space before angle brackets.  This needs to be added, or better yet, just default to the correct formatting.\n\nGiven how frequent type parameters are used, this incorrect formatting makes Visual Studio's format code feature unusable.\n\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=B22b85e7a449c47a6ae4b993ef334a75c638817585219139979_20250502-005521-image.png&tid=22b85e7a449c47a6ae4b993ef334a75c638817585219139979)\n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/2/2025, 09:52 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The problem is EXACTLY what the OP states.  The code formatter does NOT put a leading space before the open angle bracket.  Yes, this does happen if you run “autoformat code on paste”.  It also happens if you use the keyboard or menu bar to format the code.</p>\n<p>There is literally no more information you can possible need or get about this problem.  If Microsoft is too lazy to fix one line of code in the code fomatter, then at least have the honesty to admit you are not going to fix it because you don’t want to rather than you just don’t understand what the problem is and you need more information to figure it out.</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s refusal to even attempt to fix bugs in Visual Studio is exactly why VS gets a bad rap.  If a customer takes the time to hand you a bug on a silver platter, the least you can do is attempt to fix it instead of trying everything to weasle out of scheduling a bug fix.</p>\n<p>This is literally a one-minute fix.  If I had access to the Visual Studio code base I’d have it fixed already.  It cannot be hard to change the rule from “zero spaces before angle bracket” to “one space before angle bracket”.  You have spent way more time trying to get out of addressing this bug than it would take for one of your developers to actually fix it.</p>\n<p>The worst thing a software company can do is play games with its bug tracking to make it look like there are fewer bugs by having them returned for fradulant reasons rather than fixing the bug.  And using an automated closure system to get rid of the report of a bug you don’t want to fix is quite shady.  It does not instill confidence in you customers.</p>\n<p>This bug was literally posted seven months ago and you couldn’t find any time in the past half year to fix one line of code?  This is ridiculous.</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 7/11/2025, 04:53 PM: \n\n<p>This issue is currently being investigated.

The specific reason is described below.\n\n**Languages applicable:**\n\nC# and probably VB.\n\n**Code example that the analyzer should report:**\n\nI have the following code and expected that `testNull` would be `null` and `testNotNull` would not be `null`:\n```\nbool testBool = true;\nReadOnlyMemory<byte> defaultValue = new ReadOnlyMemory<byte>([1, 2]);\n\nReadOnlyMemory<byte>? testNull = (testBool ? null : defaultValue);\nReadOnlyMemory<byte>? testNotNull = (testBool ? defaultValue : null);\n```\n\nSurprisingly, this is not the case. Both variables are not `null` and the compiler recognizes that and raises warnings if I check for `null`.\n```\nbool testNullIsNull = (testNull == null); // CA15508: 'test1 == null' is always 'false'. Remove or refactor the condition(s) to avoid dead code.\nbool testNotNullIsNull = (testNotNull == null); // CA15508: 'test2 == null' is always 'false'. Remove or refactor the condition(s) to avoid dead code.\n```\n\nThe reason for this behavior are a combination of `struct` vs `class` and the `implicit operator`s in `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` which are unfortunately applied to the `null` literal. The same code but with a `class` instead of a `struct` would work as expected.\n\nHere is a simplified example:\n```\nusing System;\n\nnamespace Test\n{\n    public struct TestStruct\n    {\n        public static implicit operator TestStruct(AccessViolationException? obj) // can be any class or nullable struct\n        {\n            return new TestStruct();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class TestClass\n    {\n        public static implicit operator TestClass(AccessViolationException? obj) // can be any class or struct\n        {\n            return new TestClass();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static class Program\n    {\n        public static void Main()\n        {\n            UseTestStruct(true);\n            UseTestClass(true);\n        }\n\n        private static void UseTestStruct(bool testBool)\n        {\n            TestStruct defaultValue = new TestStruct();\n\n            TestStruct? testNull = (testBool ? null : defaultValue);\n            TestStruct? testNotNull = (testBool ? defaultValue : null);\n\n            // UNEXPECTED: testNull expected to be null but is default(TestStruct)\n            bool testNullIsNull = (testNull == null); // CA1508: 'testNull == null' is always 'false'. Remove or refactor the condition(s) to avoid dead code.\n\n            // UNEXPECTED: testNotNull expected to be not null (correct) but the warning\n            //             is wrong because is could be null if testBool was false.\n            bool testNotNullIsNull = (testNotNull == null); // CA1508: 'testNotNull == null' is always 'false'. Remove or refactor the condition(s) to avoid dead code.\n\n            Console.WriteLine(testNullIsNull + \", \" + testNotNullIsNull);\n        }\n\n        private static void UseTestClass(bool testBool)\n        {\n            TestClass defaultValue = new TestClass();\n\n            TestClass? testNull = (testBool ? null : defaultValue);\n            TestClass? testNotNull = (testBool ? defaultValue : null);\n\n            bool testNullIsNull = (testNull == null); // true and no warning\n            bool testNotNullIsNull = (testNotNull == null); // false and no warning\n\n            Console.WriteLine(testNullIsNull + \", \" + testNotNullIsNull);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf `TestStruct` had an implicit operator only for a non-nullable `struct` like `int`, the code would work as expected (`testNull` would be `null`).\n\nTo fix the code, `(TestStruct?)null` instead of just `null` can be used in the ternary operator.\n\nIt is unexpected that implicit operators are used for `null` literals in ternary operators. While this behavior is probably _correct_ (or can't be changed without breaking existing code) it would be very useful to see a warning to add a little fix (explicit casting).\n\nI therefore suggest a warning for the following case:\n- for ternary operators\n- with a nullable `struct` as target type\n- with `null` literal as one case\n- target type has `implicit operator` with nullable type\n\n**Additional information:**\n\n--\n\n**Documentation requirements:**\n\n--\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/81458","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unexpected behavior for ternary operators with implicit casting of null\" (#81458)"},{"Id":"3667630164","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-26T13:57:12","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"81457","RawContent":null,"Title":"Code snippet 'forr' creates strange looking code when the new loop is nested within another loop","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Code-snippet-forr-creates-strange-look/11004041)._\n\n---\n\\[severity:It bothers me.

data)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tvar buf = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);\n\t\t\treturn Convert.ToBase64String(T.HashData(buf)); // <--- CS0704  T.HashData\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n```\n\n**CS0704: An inner type cannot be specified through a type parameter. Try using the desired type explicitly.**\n\nIts because all implementations of HashAlgorithm are not using have abstract interface feature?\n\nBut if i declare separated methods for both SHA1 and MD5 with same name `HashData` compiler show an error that same method with same name is already defined:\n\n<img width=\"1152\" height=\"628\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a395836-a4a5-40a3-9200-77ab430622cf\" />\n\nSo the type i'm extending is not relevant to consider that extension memeber is for specific type?\n\nSo i must create a separated file to create for each extension methods for each existing hash algorithm (in this example)?\n\nAn work-around about this, i can map all existing subclasses of hash alg into a `Dictionary<Type, Func<byte[], byte[]>>` and invoke by calling `typeof(T)`\n\n```cs\nstatic readonly Dictionary<Type, Func<byte[], byte[]>> s_HashFunctions = new()\n{\n\t[typeof(SHA1)] = SHA1.HashData,\n\t[typeof(MD5)] = MD5.HashData,\n};\n\nextension<T>(T) where T : HashAlgorithm\n{\n\tpublic static string HashData(string data)\n\t{\n\t\tvar buf = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);\n\t\tvar hash = s_HashFunctions[typeof(T)](buf);\n\t\treturn Convert.ToBase64String(hash);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nI think we need some kind of really abstract interface, that we should tell to compiler which methods we expect the type to implement, because the abstract interface members we actually need type implementing it.\n\n```cs\npublic abstract interface IHashDataFunctions // abstract or (new) \"trait\" keyword\n{\n    public abstract static byte[] HashData(byte[] source); // static member\n\n    public abstract const int HashSizeInBytes; // constant member\n\n    public abstract bool TryComputeHash(ReadOnlySpan<byte> source, Span<byte> destination, out int bytesWritten); // instance member\n}\n\n// ...\n\npublic static byte[] HashData<T>(byte[] source) where T : HashAlgorithm, IHashDataFunctions\n{\n  var minSize = T.HashSizeInBytes; // get const field value. because compiler will understand any type T that extends HashAlgorithm should have IHashDataFunctions instance members, constant fields and/or static members.\n\n\n  return T.HashData(source); // call static, will no longer procudes CS0704\n\n // ...etc\n}\n\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/81439","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Extension types cannot invoke static generic members.\"

See Exceptions for the error message. \nThe \"bug\" being that this message is very vague and doesn't point toward the actual cause of the problem. My assumption is that this error is thrown because the Sql package doesn't relate to `NETCoreAppMaximumVersion` (but I'm not sure). \nWhen I commented out the `UnsupportedTargetFrameworkVersion` attribute in the `Microsoft.NET.SupportedTargetFrameworks.props` file. It gave me an error that made much more sense and made it very easy to understand what actually was the problem and I could update the sql SDK:\n\n> C:\\Users\\User\\\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.build.sql\\1.0.0-rc1\\Sdk\\Sdk.targets(60,3): error MSB4019: The imported project \"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100\\Sdks\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack\\build\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets\" was not found.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

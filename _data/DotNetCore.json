This shift is intended to make it easier for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) customers to choose whether to allow .NET 6 and beyond on their environments, without the side effects a key shared between multiple products might have.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nToday Microsoft signs .NET artifacts with a variety of certificates. For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change. Only newly built .NET 6 binaries will get the new certificate. Some tooling utilized in Visual Studio will remain on the existing cert.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n---\r\nQuestions or concerns?

It's up to the project maintainers to decide whether or not they want to rename their default branch as well. We decided that there is a value in having a unified naming convention across all our repos as opposed to having a split like \"new repos use `main`, existing repos use what they currently have\". But renaming the default branch is work and there is a reason it took as couple of months to complete the migration to `main`.\r\n\r\nIn case you're curious, [here are the steps we followed](https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet).\r\n\r\n## What do I need to do?\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**.

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- .NET SDK 5.0.202 -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- .NET 6 Preview 3 -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions."},{"Id":"15752631045","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed

With new changes to doom connection in \"Transaction Ended\" Event (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42937), \"Commit\" started failing intermittently leading to this issue. Dooming connection is essential to prevent connection re-use that leads to security issues, so that PR is valid and important.\r\n\r\nBut as a consequence, \"Commit\"'s inconsistent locking leads to this problem. Locking is essential in this part of code, but in \"Single Phase Commit\" implementation, late and split locking causes issues between Commit and Abort event handling, leading to intermittent \"Transaction Aborted Exception\".\r\n\r\nThis change in lock scope fixes the issue. It wasn't easily reproducible in Microsoft.Data.SqlClient but happens very often with System.Data.SqlClient 4.8.2 due to slow performance. Making test-case more rigorous and forcing latency while debugging aided in reproducing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n❗ **Critical**: Premier customer application is impacted due to this issue _(followed via Emails)_, and business impact is **critical**.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n**Yes**: Issue started occurring since System.Data.SqlClient v4.8.2 (PR #42937)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIt's not possible to add test case for this behavior since it's a race condition scenario and is greatly influenced by MS DTC that manages delegated transaction completion.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low**: This PR does not introduce any critical design changes, but only makes changes in lock scope.\r\nIssue has been verified by customers as well as with the repro apps available in issue [#729](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/729)\r\n\r\n\r\ncc: @danmoseley @saurabh500 @David-Engel \r\n"},{"Id":"16095183176","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-26T22:06:23","Actor":"cheenamalhotra","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43069","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[Release/3.1] Fix wrong data blended with transactions in .NET Core\" (#43069) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"Ports dotnet/sqlclient#1023 to fix a critical issue that also exists in System.Data.SqlClient:\r\n- Fixes [#980](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/980) SqlDataReader returns stale data\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nWhen working with delegated transactions, completing a transaction with open resultset leads to data corruption in the connection instance that's sent back to connection pool.

This one was added during .NET Core 5.0 development but there is a customer need to also have it in the .NET Core 3.1 release.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the `-pie` linker option was missing and while the code was being compiled as Position Independent, the executables weren't, and therefore ASLR was not applied to them. This resulted in them being loaded to fixed addresses, which might potentially open vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis port also automates the appliance of the `-fPIC/-fPIE` settings to all targets from a single centralized setting called `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`, which allows CMake to apply the appropriate compiler options without further need of manual specification.\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\nHaving these flags enabled provides the built binaries with an additional layer of security, which has become a necessary requirement for some compliance checks, as well as safer applications overall.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"705166145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-20T19:05:41","Actor":"Korporal","Number":"1775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confusing behavior when using AssemblyInfo.cs ","State":"open","Body":"I'm completely perplexed.\r\n\r\nI created a .Net Standard 2.0 library project.\r\n\r\nI explicity added an AssemblyInfo.cs file, we need this because we use this utility to \"stamp\" our assemblies when we build them:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ygoe/NetRevisionTool\r\n\r\nThat utility is run as a pre/post build event and temporarily replaces placeholders in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute with runtime values (like repo folder name, commit ID, branch etc etc).\r\n\r\nThe completed assembly then has this info \"burned\" into it as we go forward.\r\n\r\n.Net Standard is not working with this.\r\n\r\n1.

With new changes to doom connection in \"Transaction Ended\" Event (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42937), \"Commit\" started failing intermittently leading to this issue. Dooming connection is essential to prevent connection re-use that leads to security issues, so that PR is valid and important.\r\n\r\nBut as a consequence, \"Commit\"'s inconsistent locking leads to this problem. Locking is essential in this part of code, but in \"Single Phase Commit\" implementation, late and split locking causes issues between Commit and Abort event handling, leading to intermittent \"Transaction Aborted Exception\".\r\n\r\nThis change in lock scope fixes the issue. It wasn't easily reproducible in Microsoft.Data.SqlClient but happens very often with System.Data.SqlClient 4.8.2 due to slow performance. Making test-case more rigorous and forcing latency while debugging aided in reproducing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n❗ **Critical**: Premier customer application is impacted due to this issue _(followed via Emails)_.\r\n### Regression?\r\n**Yes**: Issue started occurring since System.Data.SqlClient v4.8.2 (PR #42937)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIt's not possible to add test case for this behavior since it's a race condition scenario and is greatly influenced by MS DTC that manages delegated transaction completion.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low**: This PR does not introduce any critical design changes, but only makes changes in lock scope.\r\nIssue has been verified by customers as well as with the repro apps available in issue [#729](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/729)\r\n\r\n\r\ncc: @danmoseley @saurabh500 @David-Engel \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43070","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[Release/3.1] Fix race condition issues between SinglePhaseCommit and TransactionEnded events\" (#43070)"},{"Id":"868239289","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-26T22:06:22","Actor":"cheenamalhotra","Number":"43069","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Release/3.1] Fix wrong data blended with transactions in .NET Core","State":"open","Body":"Ports dotnet/sqlclient#1023 to fix a critical issue that also exists in System.Data.SqlClient:\r\n- Fixes [#980](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/980) SqlDataReader returns stale data\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nWhen working with delegated transactions, completing a transaction with open resultset leads to data corruption in the connection instance that's sent back to connection pool.

into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main-vs-deps\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch. Generally the author whose change introduced the conflicts should pull down this PR, fix the conflicts locally, then push up a commit resolving the conflicts.\n\n### Resolve merge conflicts using your local repo\nSometimes merge conflicts may be present on GitHub but merging locally will work without conflicts.

Get();\n    }\n\nclass G : Test<int>\n    {\n        public override int? Get()\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n    }\n\nclass Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n#nullable enable\n```\nThe code is incorrect because `Get` in `G` must return `System.Int32`, not `Nullable<System.Int32>` (Suppose that the compiler behavior under type parameter constraint in this case with nullable ref types – is another question that doesn't affect Visual Studio). Marking `G` as returning `int` makes result compiling. \n\nP.S.\nJust to be clear I was make this simple example based on `CsharpSyntaxVisitor<T>` from Roslyn source codes.: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/afd10305a37c0ffb2cfb2c2d8446154c68cfa87a/src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/Syntax/CSharpSyntaxVisitor.cs#L17\n\nIn attachments you will find screenshots the result of override snippet and the metadata of `CsharpSyntaxVisitor<T>`\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 2/4/2021, 10:01 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

The compiler/IDE already supports the **highlight references** feature under `Tools > Options > C# > Advanced > Highlighting`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20465797/116448657-0808fc00-a862-11eb-88d3-1188171aafcb.png)\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest that this feature be **extended to types and the imported namespaces they come from**. For example, given this import declaration:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and later down the file, code like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n public async Task<ActionResult> LoginAsync(){}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...**I would like the IDE to highlight the `using` declaration when I put the cursor on the `Task` type name (and vice versa)**. This makes it easy to answer the question **why did I import this namespace?** by simply clicking on the `using` declaration then scrolling down the file to see which types are highlighted.\r\n\r\nAs a further enhancement to achieve the same goal, perhaps **the tooltip that's shown when you hover over a `using` declaration can be expanded to list some of the types used from that namespace**. At the moment it simply repeats what you can already see on the `using` declaration which is not very useful:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20465797/116450052-82864b80-a863-11eb-9e41-c0aa0fbe2941.png)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/52993","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Highlight member types when clicking on namespace (and vice versa).\" (#52993)"},{"Id":"870165302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-28T17:05:12","Actor":"mavasani","Number":"52991","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add compiler support for decoding severity in editorconfig entries of the form \"option_name = option_value:severity\"","State":"open","Body":"## Overview of the issue\r\n\r\nCurrent IDE code style options support the following [editorconfig syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/editorconfig-language-conventions#rule-format):\r\n\r\n```\r\noption_name = option_value:severity\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n[*.cs]\r\ndotnet_style_qualification_for_field = true:warning\r\n```\r\n\r\nCommand line compiler supports configuring severity of a specific diagnostic ID with the following [editorconfig syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers#set-rule-severity-in-an-editorconfig-file):\r\n```\r\ndotnet_diagnostic.RuleID.severity = severity\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis former syntax (`option_name = option_value:severity`) allows configuring both code style option value and severity. However, the severity setting from this syntax is only respected when executing the corresponding analyzer in the IDE live analysis. This syntax is not recognized by the command line compiler and/or the analyzer driver, so the severity setting above is redundant when executing from an explicit command line build. Additionally, with the command line compiler optimization implemented in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/43546, we no longer execute hidden/suggestion analyzers in command line builds, unless the user has explicitly specified the analyzer diagnostic ID as a warning or error with the `dotnet_diagnostic.RuleID.severity = severity` syntax. All IDE code style rules are hidden or suggestions by default. This essentially means that the only way to enforce an IDE code style rule on command line build from our CodeStyle NuGet package is by using the latter compiler recognized syntax.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/44201 suggested tackling this issue by deprecating the `:severity` suffix in `option_name = option_value:severity` syntax. However, there has been customer pushback on this as almost all existing editorconfigs out there which have IDE code style option entries use `:severity`. Note that `:severity` suffix was mandatory in this syntax up until the end of the last year, when we made it optional. This presents another case that uses will face a hard time figuring out why IDE code style option entries that specify `:warning` or `:error` doesn't cause them to be executed on command line builds.\r\n\r\n## Compiler/Analyzer Driver Feature request\r\n\r\nThe feature request here is for the compiler/analyzer driver to support decoding the `:severity` suffix in editorconfig entries with format `option_name = option_value:severity`. Additionally, the compiler will need to add some new API/mechanism for diagnostic analyzers to specify a mapping from its supported `option_names` to diagnostic ID. There are two possible ways that come to my mind for this:\r\n1. Add new overloads for `DiagnosticDescriptor` constructor that take a `string[] optionNames` or `ImmutableArray<string> optionNames` parameter, and the analyzer driver can create a `option_name <-> diagnosticId` mapping\r\n2. Allow the existing `customTags` parameter on the `DiagnosticDescriptor` ctors to have a special format to specify supported option names, say `option_names = name1;name2;name3`\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/52991","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add compiler support for decoding severity in editorconfig entries of the form \"option_name = option_value:severity\"\" (#52991)"},{"Id":"869390190","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-28T17:04:26","Actor":"genlu","Number":"52985","RawContent":null,"Title":"update publishdata for dev17","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/52985","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update publishdata for dev17\" (#52985)"},{"Id":"869532936","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-28T16:50:25","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"52988","RawContent":null,"Title":"Delete RecordStruct from DeclarationKind enum","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #52799","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/52988","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Delete RecordStruct from DeclarationKind enum\" (#52988)"},{"Id":"870098357","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-28T15:50:39","Actor":"Washi1337","Number":"52990","RawContent":null,"Title":"Roslyn incorrectly marks cast as redundant when boxing value-type values","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: \r\nTested on both:\r\n- Visual Studio 2019 Community 16.9.4\r\n- Sharplab set on `main (27 Apr 2021)`\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1.

StaticField1;\r\n    public static int StaticField2;\r\n    public static float StaticField3;\r\n\r\n    [ThreadStatic]\r\n    public static int ThreadStaticField1;\r\n\r\n    static Class1()\r\n    {\r\n        StaticField1 = \"statically nice!\";\r\n        StaticField2 = 10;\r\n        StaticField3 = 3.56f;\r\n        ThreadStaticField1 = 56;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\npublic static void DoFields()\r\n{\r\n    Class1 class1 = new Class1();\r\n    class1.Field1 = \"nice\";\r\n    class1.Field2 = 23;\r\n    class1.Field3 = 2.5f;\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field1);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field2);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field3);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void DoStaticFields()\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField1);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(String.Empty);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField2);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField3);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.ThreadStaticField1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe interpreter will happily load instance and static fields on both dynamically loaded types and types compiled into the native executable, while ensuring that static constructors have been run in both cases.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8351","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[Interpreter]

For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change. Only newly built .NET 6 binaries will get the new certificate. Some tooling utilized in Visual Studio will remain on the existing cert.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n---\r\nQuestions or concerns?

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux.

The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NuGet package restore broken on .NET 5+ with Removal of Trust of VeriSign CA\" (#180)"},{"Id":"837071846","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"Nirmal4G","Number":"179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master","State":"closed","Body":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179)"},{"Id":"826383777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:01:29","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"178","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 2.1.

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

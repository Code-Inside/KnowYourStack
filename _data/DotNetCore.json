These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across the .NET framework. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

The editor calls our implementation of IAsyncCodeLensDataPointProvider which exists in a ServiceHub process created for CodeLens which is not our usual ServiceHub process. That implementation uses the callback feature to marshal a call back to devenv, where from there we then do an OOP operation to our ServiceHub process via the usual mechanism. This is where we compute the actual results, which then get marshalled back to devenv and then back to the CodeLens ServiceHub process, where we finally send the data via the CodeLens APIs.\r\n\r\nThe core type of this is a ReferenceLocationDescriptor which represented a reference location in a specific location in a document. However, because this struct returned from our ServiceHub to devenv, and then from devenv to the CodeLens service hub, it needs to be serialized and deserialized twice. The serialization channels are different though, so whereas a DocumentId can serialize between devenv and our ServiceHub process, it would get tripped up when it serializes between devenv and the CodeLens ServiceHub process. Because of this, the type instead decomposed a DocumentId into the GUIDs and manually serialized/deserialized it.\r\n\r\nThis serialization/deserialization was broken once DocumentIds got a \"is source generated\" bit, since we'd lose that bit which would break things. I could have added that bit in and updated the serialization but the question we hit was \"why can't I just pass a DocumentId?\" Well, the answer was because we might try sending that DocumentId to the CodeLens ServiceHub process, but upon closer inspection, the result of that was never used. The flow was that we'd take the results with document IDs out of our ServiceHub process, then do some filtering and mapping for Razor scenarios (which used those document IDs); at this point the results don't need document IDs anymore. So to do this I split out the \"mapping\" as a separate operation for clarity, and then used different types, one with the ID and one without, for the different flows.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79699"},{"Id":"53624802951","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-08-20T22:16:35","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/79985","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Move logic up into DiagService\" (#79985) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Followup to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/79984\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to allow the DIagService to do all up front work on the host, then as soon as possible make the call over to OOP to do all the actual work.

I also tried to simplify code and remove some code duplication.\r\n\r\n**Performance improvements**\r\n\r\nI'm also suggesting some performance improvements that I included in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Currently the analyzer checks if an invocation is inside an expression tree before checking that it's actually `Enumerable.Any` call. I moved that check, so that it's not performed for each and every invocation expression, but only for `Any` calls.\r\n\r\n- Currently the analyzer checks if the type of an expression in `Any` call is `IEnumerable<T>` or `IEnumerable`. This check seems to be redundant because the analyzer makes a symbol check to make sure that it's exactly `Enumerable.Any` call, so the type of an expression should automatically be `IEnumerable<T>`, so I'm removing the check.\r\n\r\n  > Moreover, currently it checks for `IEnumerable<T>` incorrectly because it compares interface types with unbound generic type and the result is always `false`. So effectively it only checks if the type is non-generic `IEnumerable`.\r\n\r\n- Currently the analyzer makes `ITypeSymbol.GetMembers` and `Enumerable.OfType` calls for each of the three property checks while checking if the type has `IsEmpty`, `Count` or `Length` property. Each call apparently allocates an `ImmutableArray` with all type members, and also an enumerator returned by `OfType`. I'm changing this to call `ITypeSymbol.GetMembers(name)` method which will return a singleton `ImmutableArray.Empty` instance if there's no such property on the type, and will only return a single element array if the property is found.\r\n\r\n- I moved the check for `Count` property before the check for `Length` property because all collection types have `Count` property while only arrays have `Length`, so it seems like it's more likely that a type has `Count` property."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"595536249","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-07T13:22:05","Actor":"david-driscoll","Number":"182","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

The editor calls our implementation of IAsyncCodeLensDataPointProvider which exists in a ServiceHub process created for CodeLens which is not our usual ServiceHub process. That implementation uses the callback feature to marshal a call back to devenv, where from there we then do an OOP operation to our ServiceHub process via the usual mechanism. This is where we compute the actual results, which then get marshalled back to devenv and then back to the CodeLens ServiceHub process, where we finally send the data via the CodeLens APIs.\r\n\r\nThe core type of this is a ReferenceLocationDescriptor which represented a reference location in a specific location in a document. However, because this struct returned from our ServiceHub to devenv, and then from devenv to the CodeLens service hub, it needs to be serialized and deserialized twice. The serialization channels are different though, so whereas a DocumentId can serialize between devenv and our ServiceHub process, it would get tripped up when it serializes between devenv and the CodeLens ServiceHub process. Because of this, the type instead decomposed a DocumentId into the GUIDs and manually serialized/deserialized it.\r\n\r\nThis serialization/deserialization was broken once DocumentIds got a \"is source generated\" bit, since we'd lose that bit which would break things. I could have added that bit in and updated the serialization but the question we hit was \"why can't I just pass a DocumentId?\" Well, the answer was because we might try sending that DocumentId to the CodeLens ServiceHub process, but upon closer inspection, the result of that was never used. The flow was that we'd take the results with document IDs out of our ServiceHub process, then do some filtering and mapping for Razor scenarios (which used those document IDs); at this point the results don't need document IDs anymore. So to do this I split out the \"mapping\" as a separate operation for clarity, and then used different types, one with the ID and one without, for the different flows.\r\n\r\nThere is still one bug left here: code lens will now show references in source generated documents, but you can't open those since we aren't returning a file path VS will understand there. That's fixable too, but this is a significant improvement so let's get this done first. I'm not sure if fixing that might require other code changes in the CodeLens system...\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79699\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76608\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/74104","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/79992","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix Code Lens around source generated files\" (#79992)"},{"Id":"3339112929","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-20T22:16:34","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"79985","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move logic up into DiagService","State":"closed","Body":"Followup to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/79984\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to allow the DIagService to do all up front work on the host, then as soon as possible make the call over to OOP to do all the actual work.

I also tried to simplify code and remove some code duplication.\r\n\r\n**Performance improvements**\r\n\r\nI'm also suggesting some performance improvements that I included in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Currently the analyzer checks if an invocation is inside an expression tree before checking that it's actually `Enumerable.Any` call. I moved that check, so that it's not performed for each and every invocation expression, but only for `Any` calls.\r\n\r\n- Currently the analyzer checks if the type of an expression in `Any` call is `IEnumerable<T>` or `IEnumerable`. This check seems to be redundant because the analyzer makes a symbol check to make sure that it's exactly `Enumerable.Any` call, so the type of an expression should automatically be `IEnumerable<T>` and the check can be removed.\r\n\r\n  > Moreover, currently it checks for `IEnumerable<T>` incorrectly because it compares interface types with unbound generic type and the result is always `false`. So effectively it only checks if the type is non-generic `IEnumerable`.\r\n\r\n- Currently the analyzer makes `ITypeSymbol.GetMembers` and `Enumerable.OfType` calls for each of the three property checks while checking if the type has `IsEmpty`, `Count` or `Length` property. Each call apparently allocates an `ImmutableArray` with all type members, and also an enumerator returned by `OfType`. I'm changing this to call `ITypeSymbol.GetMembers(name)` method which will return a singleton `ImmutableArray.Empty` instance if there's no such property on the type, and will allocate a single element array if the property is found.\r\n\r\n- Currently when reporting an error the analyzer calls `ImmutableDictionary.CreateBuilder` and then calls `ToImmutable` on builder, this allocates both builder and dictionary. As it needs to add just one element to dictionary, it can be added to an empty instance thus avoiding builder allocation.\r\n\r\n- I moved the check for `Count` property before the check for `Length` property. I believe it's more likely that a type has `Count` property because all collection types have `Count` property while only arrays have `Length`. This should save a check in most cases.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50397","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"CA1860 should be reported for derived types as well (analyzer fix with performance improvements)\" (#50397)"},{"Id":"3339125698","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-20T18:23:28","Actor":"cartercanedy","Number":"50396","RawContent":null,"Title":"restore operations using dotnet 10 sdk result in ssl errors","State":"open","Body":"<!--\nPlease keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs and feature requests.\n\nIf you believe you have an issue that affects the SECURITY of the platform, please do NOT create an issue and instead email your issue details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across the .NET framework. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

Please describe.\n\nToday, when I want to update NuGet packages I'm required to do so individually. I would love for the .NET CLI to include functionality similar to `npm update`—which is capable of detecting all installed packages, and updating all of them to the latest versions.\n\nExample: I am trying to do update all NuGet packages at the same time but the .NET CLI doesn't support this natively. Instead, you'd have to install a global tool:\n\n1. **Install the tool (if not already installed):**\n   ```bash\n   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-outdated-tool\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the tool to update all packages:**\n   ```bash\n   dotnet outdated --upgrade\n   ```\n\n   This command:\n   - Scans your project or solution for outdated NuGet packages.\n   - Automatically updates them to the latest version (based on your settings and constraints).\n\n3. **Restore packages:**\n   After updating, restore the packages to ensure everything is in sync:\n   ```bash\n   dotnet restore\n   ```\n\nI would much rather prefer this functionality exist natively, no global tool requirements.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd support for `dotnet update`.

In most cases analyzer tests call `VerifyCS.VerifyAnalyzerAsync` passing test C# code. But it's often needed to specify additional test settings, like the language version in the case when a unit test needs to use language features introduced in a specific C# version. Currently it's done with a code like this:\r\n  \r\n  ```cs\r\n  await new VerifyCS.Test\r\n  {\r\n      TestCode = @\"...\",\r\n      LanguageVersion = LanguageVersion.CSharp8\r\n  }.RunAsync();\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Currently C# code specified for `TestCode` does not get syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n  What about providing a helper method like this:\r\n\r\n  ```cs\r\n  public class Test : ...\r\n  {\r\n      public static Test Create([StringSyntax(\"C#-test\")] string source, LanguageVersion languageVersion = DefaultLanguageVersion, params ReadOnlySpan<DiagnosticResult> expected) { ... }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nCurrently the code in a test might look like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1242\" height=\"322\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe309787-9e79-4430-a53f-232d331a1490\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nWith raw string literals and a helper method, this is what it will look like (I included such tests in #50339):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1241\" height=\"352\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf078739-a145-4642-978d-b5e9e669d974\" />"},{"Id":"53491482948","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-08-18T12:30:34","Actor":"Alex-Sob","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50341","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"CA1033 should not report errors for interfaces\" (#50341) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"[Re-created from the [original issue](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/6785) reported in the old repo]\n\n[CA1033](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1033) is incorrectly reported for interfaces with default implementations, for example:\n\n```cs\npublic interface IBase\n{\n    void M();\n}\n\npublic interface IDerived : IBase\n{\n    // Causes CA1033: Make 'IDerived' sealed (a breaking change if this class has previously shipped), implement the method non-explicitly, or implement a new method that exposes the functionality of 'ConsoleApp.IBase.M' and is visible to derived classes\n    void IBase.M() => Console.WriteLine();\n}\n```\n\nI believe that this rule does not apply to interfaces. The issue arises when there's a class `A` that implements interface `I` explicitly, and there's class `B` that derives from `A` and also implements `I`. The issue is that `B` cannot call base implementation. In case of interfaces, the default implementation of a method is used only when implementing type does not implement that method itself.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

I'd like to know if this is expected behavior?\n\nI'm writing a wrapper for COM interface pointers to be used with COM interface structs generated by cswin32 (with marshaling disabled). The main logic is as follows:\n\n```cs\ninternal partial struct ComPtr<T> : IDisposable\n    where T : unmanaged, Windows.Win32.IComIID\n{\n    private nint ptr;\n\n    public readonly bool IsNull => ptr == 0;\n\n    // AddRef, Release, QueryInterface, Dispose ...\n\n    public unsafe readonly T* Get() =>\n        (T*)ptr;\n\n    // Note: Get2 correctly returns a ref readonly, but subsequent \n    // method calls on the returned reference may still cause copying when \n    // calling non-readonly methods\n    public unsafe readonly ref readonly T Get2() =>\n        ref Unsafe.AsRef<T>((void*)ptr);\n\n    public unsafe readonly T** GetAddressOf() =>\n        (T**)Unsafe.AsPointer(ref GetThisRef().ptr);\n\n    public unsafe readonly void** GetAddressOfAny() =>\n        (void**)Unsafe.AsPointer(ref GetThisRef().ptr);\n}\n```\n\nHere, methods are marked as `readonly` to avoid copying. Usage example:\n\n```cs\nusing var comPtr = default(ComPtr<ISomeInterface>);\n\nvar hr = Windows.Win32.PInvoke.CoCreateInstance(\n    in Guids.CLSID_SomeInterface,\n    null,\n    CLSCTX.CLSCTX_ALL,\n    in ISomeInterface.IID_Guid,\n    out *comPtr.GetAddressOfAny());\n\ncomPtr.Get()->XXX();\n```\n\nHowever, the `->` operator can only be used in unsafe contexts, and the `await` keyword isn't allowed in unsafe contexts, making usage inconvenient.\n\nIf we modify the `Get` method to return a `ref readonly` value, calling `comPtr.Get2().XXX()` might cause errors due to variable copying.\n\nIs there any way to achieve this functionality?\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79931","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Question about this-copying when calling methods on value type objects\" (#79931)"},{"Id":"3327519779","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-16T18:25:10","Actor":"KirillOsenkov","Number":"79932","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing XML doc comments on Incremental Generator public API","State":"open","Body":"The incremental generator public API could really benefit from XML doc comments.\n\nSpecifically:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/cdc829e937047f803f7663d4339d24b0a8e7fc39/src/Compilers/Core/Portable/SourceGeneration/Nodes/ValueSourceExtensions.cs\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/cdc829e937047f803f7663d4339d24b0a8e7fc39/src/Compilers/Core/Portable/SourceGeneration/IncrementalContexts.cs\n\n@chsienki @jjonescz ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79932","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing XML doc comments on Incremental Generator public API\" (#79932)"},{"Id":"3327173334","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-16T11:05:55","Actor":"bjornhellander","Number":"79930","RawContent":null,"Title":"Regression in SemanticModel.GetSymbolInfo?","State":"open","Body":"This test passes when run against Roslyn versions 3.11.0, 4.0.1, 4.4.0, 4.8.0 and 4.12.0:\n```\n[TestMethod]\npublic async Task T1()\n{\n    var code = \"\"\"\npublic class OuterClass\n{\n    void M()\n    {\n        var s = OuterClass.InnerClass();\n    }\n\n    public class InnerClass\n    {\n    }\n}\n\"\"\";\n\n    var syntaxTree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(code);\n    var syntaxRoot = await syntaxTree.GetRootAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);\n    var invocationNode = syntaxRoot.DescendantNodes().OfType<InvocationExpressionSyntax>().Single();\n    var expressionNode = invocationNode.Expression;\n\n    var compilation = CSharpCompilation.Create(\n        \"scratch\",\n        [syntaxTree],\n        await ReferenceAssemblies.NetStandard.NetStandard20.ResolveAsync(LanguageNames.CSharp, default).ConfigureAwait(false));\n\n    var semanticModel = compilation.GetSemanticModel(syntaxTree);\n    var diagnostics = semanticModel.GetDiagnostics();\n    Assert.HasCount(1, diagnostics);\n    Assert.AreEqual(\"CS1955\", diagnostics[0].Id);

A fix would be nice]\nI found an old [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2008/08/four-regular-expressions-to-check-email-addresses/) with 4 regular expressions to validate email addresses. The 4th example is an expression with almost 6500 characters from a Perl module: [RegEx](https://pdw.ex-parrot.com/Mail-RFC822-Address.html)\nJust for the fun of it, I tried to generate code with the C# source generator. This works surprisingly well, 30000 lines are generated in about 1 second.\n\nUnfortunately, the CPU usage of ServiceHub.RoslynCodeAnalysisService.exe stays at about 12% and memory usage grows very fast. After 30 seconds the task used 700MB, after 60 seconds it was 3000MB and after 90 seconds 5000MB. However, Visual studio was still working without freezing or crashing.\n\nThe problem is easy to reproduce. Use this .csproj file:\n\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n    <ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n</Project>\nAnd the following [Program.cs](https://aka.ms/dc/file?name=B2d624d7043ad4e28b2b663044e9c9cc7638779410169473344_Program.cs&tid=2d624d7043ad4e28b2b663044e9c9cc7638779410169473344). The RegEx is in the attachment or in the given link. The other expressions from the Wired link did not cause any problems, even tough one of it has also 1000 characters.\n\nusing System;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\nnamespace RegExTest\n{\n    public static partial class Program\n    {\n        public static void Main()\n        {\n            bool isEmail = GetIsEmailAddressRegex().IsMatch([Redacted]@[Redacted]);\n\n            Console.Write(isEmail);\n        }\n\n        [GeneratedRegex(\"<See attachment for RegEx >\", RegexOptions.Compiled)]\n        private static partial Regex GetIsEmailAddressRegex();\n    }\n}\nI could reproduce the problem on my current Surface Laptop with Windows 11 and ARM processor and also on my old laptop with Windows 10 and amd64 processor. I have Visual Studio 2022 v17.13.4 installed on both devices.\n\nNote that numerous issues were reported about ServiceHub.RoslynCodeAnalysisService.exe and high CPU/memory usage: [This](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/High-memory-usage-of-ServiceHubRoslynCo/1668250), [This](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/ServiceHubRoslynCodeAnalysisServiceexe/1428683) and [This](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/High-CPU-Usage-in-ServiceHubRoslynCodeA/10641615).

Please describe.\n\nToday, when I want to update NuGet packages I'm required to do so individually. I would love for the .NET CLI to include functionality similar to `npm update`—which is capable of detecting all installed packages, and updating all of them to the latest versions.\n\nExample: I am trying to do update all NuGet packages at the same time but the .NET CLI doesn't support this natively. Instead, you'd have to install a global tool:\n\n1. **Install the tool (if not already installed):**\n   ```bash\n   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-outdated-tool\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the tool to update all packages:**\n   ```bash\n   dotnet outdated --upgrade\n   ```\n\n   This command:\n   - Scans your project or solution for outdated NuGet packages.\n   - Automatically updates them to the latest version (based on your settings and constraints).\n\n3. **Restore packages:**\n   After updating, restore the packages to ensure everything is in sync:\n   ```bash\n   dotnet restore\n   ```\n\nI would much rather prefer this functionality exist natively, no global tool requirements.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd support for `dotnet update`.

In most cases analyzer tests call `VerifyCS.VerifyAnalyzerAsync` passing test C# code. But it's often needed to specify additional test settings, like the language version in the case when a unit test needs to use language features introduced in a specific C# version. Currently it's done with a code like this:\r\n  \r\n  ```cs\r\n  await new VerifyCS.Test\r\n  {\r\n      TestCode = @\"...\",\r\n      LanguageVersion = LanguageVersion.CSharp8\r\n  }.RunAsync();\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Currently C# code specified for `TestCode` does not get syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n  What about providing a helper method like this:\r\n\r\n  ```cs\r\n  public class Test : ...\r\n  {\r\n      public static Test Create([StringSyntax(\"C#-test\")] string source, LanguageVersion languageVersion = DefaultLanguageVersion, params ReadOnlySpan<DiagnosticResult> expected) { ... }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nCurrently the code in a test might look like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1242\" height=\"322\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe309787-9e79-4430-a53f-232d331a1490\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nWith raw string literals and a helper method, this is what it will look like (I included such tests in #50339):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1241\" height=\"352\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf078739-a145-4642-978d-b5e9e669d974\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nSome benefits:\r\n\r\n- Test code gets syntax highlighting.\r\n- VS draws a nice vertical line for raw string literals, which also means that there's no extra whitespace before the code so that it does not have to start from the very left overflowing the test.\r\n- Expected diagnostics can be passed as well in a single call.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50342","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[Proposal] Analyzer test readability improvements\" (#50342)"},{"Id":"3330525990","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-18T12:30:33","Actor":"Alex-Sob","Number":"50341","RawContent":null,"Title":"CA1033 should not report errors for interfaces","State":"open","Body":"[Re-created from the [original issue](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/6785) reported in the old repo]\n\n[CA1033](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1033) is incorrectly reported for interfaces with default implementations, for example:\n\n```cs\npublic interface IBase\n{\n    void M();\n}\n\npublic interface IDerived : IBase\n{\n    // Causes CA1033: Make 'IDerived' sealed (a breaking change if this class has previously shipped), implement the method non-explicitly, or implement a new method that exposes the functionality of 'ConsoleApp.IBase.M' and is visible to derived classes\n    void IBase.M() => Console.WriteLine();\n}\n```\n\nI believe that this rule does not apply to interfaces. The issue arises when there's a class `A` that implements interface `I` explicitly, and there's class `B` that derives from `A` and also implements `I`. The issue is that `B` cannot call base implementation. In case of interfaces, the default implementation of a method is used only when implementing type does not implement that method itself.

However, if no suppressions are needed, the suppressions file is silently left unchanged. This is unexpected, as if there is even one error to be suppressed, the entire file is rewritten. Instead, no changes are made, and a pack without `ApiCompatGenerateSuppressionsFile` set will fail.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a dummy package. Pack it and add it to a folder in `nuget.config`.\n2. Bump its version, enable the SDK ApiCompat analyzers and point them at the previous version.\n3. Make a change ApiCompat will warn about (e.g. removing a type/method)\n4. `dotnet pack`. Note the errors. Then generate a suppressions file with `dotnet pack -p:ApiCompatGenerateSuppressionsFile=true`.\n5. Add the new version to the package folder from 1.\n6. Repeat 2. The baseline version should now be the one built in 4. This time, no changes will be made.\n7. `dotnet pack`. Note the errors about unnecessary warnings.\n8. `dotnet pack -p:ApiCompatGenerateSuppressionsFile=true`. No errors, file is NOT updated.\n\nSubsequent `dotnet pack`s will not error because MSBuild doesn't rerun the target. A `dotnet clean -c Release` is needed for the error to show again.\n\n### Further technical details\n<details><summary>details of dotnet --info</summary>\n<p>\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.304\n Commit:            f12f5f689e\n Workload version:  9.0.300-manifests.ad61bb1c\n MSBuild version:   17.14.16+5d8159c5f\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.19045\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.304\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [android]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36408.4\n   Manifest Version:    35.0.78/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.android\\35.0.78\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [ios]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36408.4\n   Manifest Version:    18.5.9214/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.ios\\18.5.9214\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maccatalyst]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36408.4\n   Manifest Version:    18.5.9214/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maccatalyst\\18.5.9214\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maui-windows]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36408.4\n   Manifest Version:    9.0.51/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maui\\9.0.51\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.8\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       aae90fa090\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.413 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.203 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.304 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.30 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.30 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.19 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.30 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.32 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.19 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.19 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50332","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ApiCompatGenerateSuppressionsFile does not write if no suppressions are needed\" (#50332)"},{"Id":"3329623531","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-18T07:58:32","Actor":"NicoleWang001","Number":"50331","RawContent":null,"Title":"[NETE2ESDK][Mac][Linux][Regression] With .NET 10.0.100-rc.1.25409.103 Binaries, xunit project tested failed with error MSB6006 if DOTNET_ROOT was not set.","State":"open","Body":"**REGRESSION INFO**\nWorked well on .NET 10.0.100-rc.1.25409.103\nWorked  well on  .NET 10 Preview 7\n\n**REPRO STEPS**\n1.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

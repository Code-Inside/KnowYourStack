<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

method:\n```cs\nextension(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    public IServiceCollection AddOpenApiWithSecurityScheme2(AzureAdOptions aadOptions)\n    {\n        services.AddOpenApi(options =>\n

instance `++`/`--` operators get different predefined method names (as opposed to static `++`/`--` operators).

Given that, we need a simple and reliable heuristic to do that for operator declarations and for CRef references. This change implements the following heuristic for `++`/`--` operators – if there is an empty argument list in the syntax, the construct is treated as instance operator and gets instance operator names, otherwise it is treated as static operator and gets static operator names.

However, `PublishTrimmed` introduces limitations for reflection due to trimming, creating challenges for applications that heavily rely on reflection.  \n\nWhen migrating my application from .NET 8.0 to .NET 9.0, I noticed that `PublishTrimmed` is now required, whereas in previous versions, it was optional. This transition can be especially challenging for developers with large codebases or those new to the intricacies of reflection under trimming.  \n\n**Proposed Feature:**  \nIntroduce a new mode or option in the project file (`.csproj`) to aid developers in adapting to `PublishTrimmed` restrictions. This mode would:  \n\n1. **Disable Unsupported Reflection:**  \n   - Provide compile-time warnings or errors when using reflection patterns that are incompatible with trimming.  \n   - Help developers identify and address reflection-related issues during development rather than at runtime.\n\n2. **Guided Migration:**  \n   - Offer a configuration mode (e.g., `<RestrictReflection>` or `<ReflectionCompatibility>` in `.csproj`) that ensures only trimming-compatible reflection APIs are used.  \n   - Optionally, include analyzers or tools to scan and report reflection usage in the codebase.\n\n**Benefits:**  \n- **Improved Developer Experience:** Newcomers and seasoned developers alike will benefit from clear guidance on reflection compatibility when using `PublishTrimmed`.  \n- **Reduced Migration Overhead:** Developers migrating large applications can proactively address issues, minimizing surprises during runtime.  \n- **Enhanced Reliability:** By catching problematic reflection patterns early, the likelihood of runtime failures is reduced.\n\n**Example:**  \n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n    <PublishTrimmed>true</PublishTrimmed>\n    <RestrictReflection>true</RestrictReflection>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```  \nWhen enabled, this mode would produce warnings or errors for unsupported reflection patterns, making it clear which parts of the code require adjustments.\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \nLarge applications often rely on reflection in various forms, and transitioning to `PublishTrimmed` should not feel like a stumbling block. By providing clear tooling and guidance, developers can make their applications trimming-compatible more easily and confidently.\n"},{"Id":"49343442027","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-05-04T20:17:43","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/48809","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[release/10.0.1xx-preview4] Don't flow OutputPath global property in dotnet-sdk.proj\" (#48809) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Backport of #48808 to release/10.0.1xx-preview4\n\n/cc @ViktorHofer"},{"Id":"49342763872","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-05-04T19:16:09","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/48808","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Don't flow OutputPath global property in dotnet-sdk.proj\" (#48808) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Noticed in https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/pull/374 -> dotnet-sdk.proj imports sdk-tasks.targets which defines a P2P to sdk-tasks.csproj which incorrectly receives the globally set OutputPath property.\r\n\r\nThe PublishToDisk target receives the globally set OutputPath property that signals where to publish the files to.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

This, for example, is causing validation errors in dotnet/runtime's attempts to use extension everything in public surface area, because the extension type signatures are added to a ref assembly and separately with implementation to a src assembly, and because of differences outsides of the public surface area, the resulting IL differs between the two in the public APIs that end up getting exposed.\n\nRegardless of whether this can be improved in Roslyn, we should also look into whether the package validation should be taught about unspeakable surface area. Or if we consider such unspeakable (in C#) surface area to still be something that would be a problem if it's not maintained, whether there's any way to avoid those public types in the first place.\n\ncc: @jcouv, @jaredpar, @ericstj","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/78416","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extension everything public metadata types break .NET package validation\" (#78416)"},{"Id":"3036665133","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-02T19:14:02","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"78415","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to use extension everything to write a generic Cast that works with LINQ query comprehensions","State":"open","Body":"The LINQ specification expands:\n```C#\nfrom T t in source\n```\nto use `source.Cast<T>()`.\n\nFor `Enumerable.Cast<T>`, this works because the source is a non-generic `IEnumerable`, and thus there's only the one generic type parameter for the result.\n\nFor `AsyncEnumerable.Cast`, this falls down. Such a Cast extension method today needs to be generic on both the TSource and TResult, e.g.\n```C#\npublic static IAsyncEnumerable<TResult> Cast<TSource, TResult>(this IAsyncEnumerable<TSource> source)\n```\nand the C# compiler refuses to bind the `from` cast syntax when the arity of Cast doesn't match.\n\nI was expecting extension everything would fix this, e.g.\n```C#\nextension<TSource>(IAsyncEnumerable<TSource> source)\n{\n    public IAsyncEnumerable<TResult> Cast<TResult>() { ... }\n}\n```\nbut unfortunately it doesn't. While I can write the above, it doesn't provide any expressive power that didn't already exist with extension methods today, because the resulting method still has a generic arity of 2, and I still need to provide both type arguments in order to use it, e.g.\n```C#\nIAsyncEnumerable<Base> source = ...;\nvar result = source.Cast<Base, Derived>();\n```\nand the C# compiler refuses to use it to satisfy Cast.\n```C#\nIAsyncEnumerable<Derived> results1 = from x in source // OK\n                                     select (Derived)x;\n\nIAsyncEnumerable<Derived> results2 = from Derived x in source // Error!!\n                                     select x;\n````\n\ncc: @jcouv, @MadsTorgersen ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/78415","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to use extension everything to write a generic Cast that works with LINQ query comprehensions\" (#78415)"},{"Id":"3036655757","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-02T19:07:59","Actor":"dibarbet","Number":"78414","RawContent":null,"Title":"Correctness CI failing with roslyn-analyzers documentation errors","State":"open","Body":"Started randomly failing with errors similar to\n```\nMissing entry in D:\\a\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\RoslynAnalyzers\\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers\\RulesMissingDocumentation.md\n  RS2000 | <https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/RoslynAnalyzers/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers/ReleaseTrackingAnalyzers.Help.md> | Add analyzer diagnostic IDs to analyzer release |\n  One or more auto-generated documentation files were either edited manually, or not updated.

Incorrectly Modifies Event Handler Return Type","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/VS2022-Incorrectly-Modifies-Event-Handle/10897953)._\n\n---\n[severity:It bothers me. A fix would be nice]\n# Bug Report: VS2022 Incorrectly Modifies Event Handler Return Type\n\n## Description\nWhen modifying an event handler method to include an `await` statement, Visual Studio 2022 automatically changes the method signature from `private void` to `private async Task`. This is incorrect for certain event handlers like ContentDialog button click events, which must remain as `void` or `async void` to function properly.\n\n## Repro Steps\n1. Create a UWP application with a ContentDialog\n2. Implement a button click handler with the following signature:\n```csharp\nprivate void ContentDialog_PrimaryButtonClick(ContentDialog sender, ContentDialogButtonClickEventArgs args)\n{\n    Work();\n}\n```\n3. Change the method body to await an asynchronous call (e.g., `await Work();`)\n4. Observe that VS2022 automatically changes the method signature to:\n```csharp\nprivate async Task ContentDialog_PrimaryButtonClick(ContentDialog sender, ContentDialogButtonClickEventArgs args)\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhen adding `await` to a method body of an event handler, VS2022 should change the signature to `private async void` since event handlers cannot return a Task.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nVS2022 changes the method signature to `private async Task`, which makes the event handler unusable since ContentDialog event handlers must be `void` or `async void`.\n\n## Impact\nThis incorrect automatic modification forces developers to manually fix the method signature after each time they add an asynchronous call within an event handler, reducing productivity and potentially causing runtime errors if not caught.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 2/5/2025, 02:44 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

As soon as you chain more than 2 Combine calls, you end up with a tuple of tuples (of tuples) return type: `(p1,p2), p3), p4)` which are hard to work with and make sense of as all the parts are either named Left or Right.\n\nWe often flatten the tuples for easier consumption:\n\n```csharp\nvar sourceProvider = provider1\n\t.Combine(provider2)\n\t.Combine(provider3)\n\t.Combine(provider4)\n\t.Select(static (t, _) => (t.Left.Left.Left, t.Left.Left.Right, t.Left.Right, t.Right))\n\t.WithTrackingName(\"provider5\");\n```\n(and even while typing this, I'm unsure if this is correct. let's say it is)\n\nThat flattening syntax is atrocious, hard to read, hard to understand, hard to write, and hard to debug (nested tuples of Left and Right). I'm actually very afraid of modifying those lines, unless I have time, a piece of paper, and a pencil (why don't you use Copilot, Stephane ?).\n\nThe doc states \"Combine is the most powerful, but also most complicated transformation\" (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/incremental-generators.md). Well, it shouldn't be complicated.\n## Proposed API\n\nTo solve that, I wrote a few extensions methods that accepts more than 2 providers for combining, and I think they'd be beneficial to anyone writing an incremental source generator slightly more complex than the basic sample.\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis\n{\n    public static class IncrementalValueProviderExtensions\n    {\n+        public static IncrementalValuesProvider<(TItem1, TItem2, TItem3)> Combine<TItem1, TItem2, TItem3>(this IncrementalValuesProvider<TItem1> provider1, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem2> provider2, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem3> provider3);\n+\n+        public static IncrementalValuesProvider<(TItem1, TItem2, TItem3, TItem4)> Combine<TItem1, TItem2, TItem3, TITem4>(this IncrementalValuesProvider<TItem1> provider1, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem2> provider2, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem3> provider3, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem4> provider4);\n+\n+ //goes up to reasonable amount\n+\n+        public static IncrementalValueProvider<(TItem1, TItem2, TItem3)> Combine<TItem1, TItem2, TItem3>(this IncrementalValueProvider<TItem1> provider1, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem2> provider2, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem3> provider3);\n+\n+        public static IncrementalValueProvider<(TItem1, TItem2, TItem3, TItem4)> Combine<TItem1, TItem2, TItem3, TITem4>(this IncrementalValueProvider<TItem1> provider1, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem2> provider2, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem3> provider3, IncrementalValueProvider<TItem4> provider4);\n+\n+ //goes up to reasonable amount\n \n     }\n}\n```\n\nA 'reasonable amount' would be at least overloads taking up to 5 providers. to be aligned with the design choices of System.Tuple (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.tuple-8?view=net-9.0) and ValueTuple it could go up to 8, being named provider1 to 7, and then a Rest)\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nThe example given earlier now becomes:\n\n```csharp\nvar sourceProvider = provider1.Combine(provider2, provider3, provider4)\n\t.WithTrackingName(\"provider5\");\n```\n\nand that tuple is easy to deconstruct in RegisterSourceOutput's action:\n```csharp\nvar (item1, item2, item3, item4) = provider;\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n/\n\n## Risks\n\nThose are a set of extensions methods, I have no idea what could go wrong....","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/78408","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide overloads for IncrementalValue[s]Provider.Combine accepting more than 2 providers\"

The user gets an error that the package (the name of which has been normalized) is not supported.\n\nThis led to an issue with the Azure Functions Core Tools, which uses `dotnet new` behind the scenes. That issue is here for reference: https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/issues/4399\n\nThe exact same gestures work fine with SDK 9.0.102.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. On MacOS using Apple Silicon, install .NET SDK 9.0.200 or later.\n2. Create a path that includes an`@` character:\n  a. `mkdir repro@4`\n3. Put a copy of any templating package into that folder:\n  a. `dotnet new console`\n  b. `dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.ProjectTemplates -v 4.0.5086 --package-directory ./repro@4`\n4. Install that package with `dotnet new install` using the absolute path to it:\n  a. `dotnet new install ./repro@4/microsoft.azure.functions.worker.projecttemplates/4.0.5086/microsoft.azure.functions.worker.projecttemplates.4.0.5086.nupkg`\n\nThe Azure Functions Core Tools issue referenced above provides an alternative set of repro steps, in context. That issue is unfortunately compounded by that tool swallowing the error from `dotnet new install`, but the notes there may be helpful as well.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```cli\ndotnet new --install \"/usr/local/Cellar/azure-functions-core-tools@4/4.0.7030/templates/net-isolated/projectTemplates.4.0.5051.nupkg\" -v diag\n[2025-05-01 16:21:19.535] [Debug] [Template Engine] => [Execute]: Execute started\nWarning: use of 'dotnet new --install' is deprecated.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

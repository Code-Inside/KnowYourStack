For example, a 'code action' can take unbounded time as it does its work computing the change to happen.  During this time, the IDE pops up a dialog (potentially embedded right in the source) allowing a user to know something is happening, and giving them:\r\n\r\n1. a description of what is going on.\r\n2. progress of the operation (when possible).\r\n3. a way to cancel (esc, or a button).\r\n\r\nThis works acceptably, but has a major limitation.  Specifically, when we call out to other components (esp. 3rd party ones) there is no ability for those components to give use information to the user as to what's going on.  As such, our features can only give extremely coarse information on what's happening.  \r\n\r\nWe do have an API to provide more detailed information.  But it is currently internal.  This is problematic for the above reason, and because it bifurcates our API.  Specifically, our API has internal extension points that use this API, and those that do not.  Making things very hard to manage.  This also acts a limiting factor bringing certain features to things like the CodeStyle package (which can only use public APIs from roslyn).\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// Represents the progress of an operation.

Currently, the only API updated to understand this API are the Code-Action apis. \r\n\r\nNote: code-actions always supported progress, just through an internal-only api.  This PR effectively moves all those internal APIs over to using this new shape and then exposes them publicly as the preferred way to do work.  \r\n\r\nThe CodeAnalysisProgress message allows code to effectively do three things:\r\n\r\n1. Update the description being shown to the user in whatever UI is informing them of progress (a 'threaded wait dialog' in the case of code-actions).\r\n2. Update any progress indicator that is being shown by telling it about some amount of incomplete work that needs to be performed.  For example, the number of files that need to be analyzed.\r\n3. Update any progress indicator that is being shown by telling it about some amount of now-completed work.  \r\n\r\nFuture messages could be added if necessary.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

This can be useful in some scenarios. For instance, in [ComputeSharp](https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp), I need this to be able to get the parameter and obtain the original name of the parameter (because the field name is just an unspeakable name).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a way of doing this.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nWe actually don't need any new APIs for this. All we need is for `IFieldSymbol`-s of such fields to return the original `IParameterSymbol` via their `AssociatedSymbol` property, so that things can be checked in a similar manner to how eg. you can obtain the auto-property from a compiler generated backing field for such auto-property (which is returned by  `AssociatedSymbol`).\r\n\r\nThe docs for `AssociatedSymbol` say the following:\r\n\r\n> \"\"If this field serves as a backing variable for an automatically generated property or a field-like event, returns that  property/event. Otherwise returns null. **Note, the set of possible associated symbols might be expanded in the future to  reflect changes in the languages.**\"\"\r\n\r\nSo it seems expanding this set to include this particular scenario is also something that would be expected by such API.\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nstring visibleFieldName = fieldSymbol.AssociatedSymbol switch\r\n{\r\n    IParameterSymbol ctorParam => ctorParam.Name,\r\n    _ => fieldSymbol.Name\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Use the visible field name in some way\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nThere's just no reliable way of doing this today (short of just trying to match the `<\\w+>P` regex pattern, which is undocumented.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nOnly an issue if anyone has taken a hard dependency on the only currently existing scenarios where `AssociatedSymbol` returns non-`null`, but doing so would explicitly go against what the documentation of that API says, so it really shouldn't be an issue.\r\n\r\ncc. @333fred @AlekseyTs","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70208","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IFieldSymbol.AssociatedSymbol should return the IParameterSymbol of the primary constructor parameter, if the field is a capture\" (#70208)"},{"Id":"1919818092","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-02T16:42:17","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"70193","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update 'use collection expression' analyzer/fixer to support conversion when a capacity argument is passed.","State":"closed","Body":"This now means that we will detect and properly suggest the fix in cases like:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nList<int> list = new List<int>(1 + x.Count);\r\nlist.Add(0);\r\nlist.AddRange(x);\r\n\r\n// suggest converting to:\r\nList<int> list = [0, .. x];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe capacity expression is checked to make sure it matches up with the data being added.

Modify WorkspacePullDiagnosticHandler so that it reports diagnostics when either of the following conditions are met:\r\n      1. Full solution analysis is enabled (it was already doing so prior to this PR)\r\n      2. Project was already force analyzed and has cached diagnostics (it could be via Run Code Analysis command or any other client in future).\r\n   2. Update the Workspace and Project diagnostic sources added by the Workspace pull handler to do the following:\r\n      1. If full solution analysis is enabled, compute and report the closed file diagnostics for the latest solution snapshot\r\n      2. Otherwise, return the already cached closed file diagnostics, which may be from a prior snapshot (this matches the non-LSP behavior when Run Code Analysis command is executed)\r\n   3. Update the `DiagnosticAnalyzerService.ForceAnalyzeAsync` command that is invoked during Run Code Analysis to keep track of projects that were force analyzed. Additionally, also send a workspace diagnostic refresh request to the LSP client after each project has finished analysis.\r\n\r\n   With the above changes, Run Code Analysis command executes and reports diagnostics as expected in LSP pull diagnostics mode. There is still a considerable delay (10 sec) in error list getting populated with diagnostics from this command as the workspace diagnostic refresh is triggered at a delay. We will be addressing this in a separate follow-up change, where in we will trigger a new kind of diagnostic refresh request specifically catered to code analysis execution, such that the client does the workspace pull without any delay. We are still unsure if we need to pass in the project context around in this refresh request OR let it be a full refresh, given the server is only going to attempt to return workspace diagnostics from the cache, so a full refresh request may not incur any significant cost.\r\n\r\n2. **Second commit https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70186/commits/c892a8381692d62c559f20c5495310700cdae789:** Fix Run Code Analysis when background analysis has been disabled via project options or global options\r\n\r\n**TBD:** Add unit tests for this scenario. I am going to do this in a follow-up PR so that #70040 does not stay blocked on the product changes here.\r\n\r\n## Non-LSP pull diags experience\r\n![RunCodeAnalysis_NonLSP](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/10605811/07a443b7-9f0f-4138-b9bc-d09a8a8d61e1)\r\n\r\n## LSP pull diags experience (with this change)\r\n![RunCodeAnalysis_LSP](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/10605811/cdfe73b1-c5ea-4d75-80bf-987166df5139)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70186","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Enable LSP pull diagnostics from Run Code Analysis command\" (#70186)"},{"Id":"1918442007","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-29T00:43:31","Actor":"tmat","Number":"70184","RawContent":null,"Title":"Synthesized members","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70184","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Synthesized members\" (#70184)"},{"Id":"1918404146","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-28T23:41:53","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"70183","RawContent":null,"Title":"Collection expressions: adjust the plural in CS1503","State":"open","Body":"In error messages like `error CS1503: Argument 1: cannot convert from 'collection expressions' to 'string'` we don't need the plural on the feature name.\r\nAlso in `error CS0019: Operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'collection expressions' and 'List<int>'`","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70183","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Collection expressions: adjust the plural in CS1503\" (#70183)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"SDK-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1923097018","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-03T01:15:26","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"35813","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:49f893b0-29b9-4954-0eaa-08db9e40a4f0)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/templating\r\n- **Subscription**: 49f893b0-29b9-4954-0eaa-08db9e40a4f0\r\n- **Build**: 20231002.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: October 3, 2023 12:40:47 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: c67277cde1508678611198dc2556eed70c3d32a9\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/8.0.1xx\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

To avoid this issue, users are encouraged to ensure that they are using only **Visual Studio 17.8 preview 3** with **.NET SDK 8.0.100-rc.2**. Any other version combinations can lead to the errors described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How do I know I have this issue?\r\n\r\nIf you see errors like the following in your Visual Studio error pane:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.TypeLoadException: Could not load type 'Enumerator' from assembly 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, Version=4.8.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'. \r\n C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Preview\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\Roslyn\\Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets 84\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What can I do to resolve this issue?\r\n\r\nIf you are not using **Visual Studio 17.8 preview 3** with .NET SDK 8.0.100-rc.2 - upgrade to Visual Studio 17.8 preview 3. This is the only combination of VS/SDK that is known to work.  If this is not an option, the `BuildWithNetFrameworkHostedCompiler` can be set to `true` for a project or group of projects, which will cause the VS tooling to use Roslyn tooling from an out-of-band NuGet Package instead. This NuGet-delivered tooling will not have this Razor Tooling issue, but may not be tested with the version of Visual Studio you are using.\r\n\r\n## Why is this issue happening?\r\n\r\nAn API-breaking change was made in an assembly shipped by Roslyn that the Razor tooling had a hidden dependency on. In addition, an SDK layout issue meant that the Razor tooling bug couldn't be easily worked around by making the Roslyn DLL load at a higher priority order. Both things could be fixed, but not by the time the .NET SDK had 'locked' for packaging the RC2 release.\r\n\r\n## Where can I find out more?\r\n\r\nThis [Razor tooling issue](https://github.com/dotnet/razor/issues/9342) is the tracking issue for the error, and the Roslyn fix going forward is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70203).\r\n\r\n## Will this be a problem for .NET 8 GA release in November?\r\n\r\n**No** - by the GA release we will have resolved the underlying problems in the dependency relationship between Roslyn and Razor for this assembly, and tooling will once again have a consistent shared view of the API surface area.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/35810","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[8.0.100-rc.2] Potential for incompatibility between Razor Tooling in Visual Studio and the .NET SDK\" (#35810)"},{"Id":"1920015199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-02T17:08:51","Actor":"MiYanni","Number":"35797","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable IDE0200 \"Lambda expression can be removed\" warning","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\nAfter a discussion in the [PR for cleaning up IDE0200](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35678), the conclusion was to, instead, simply disable the warning.

invoke Publish Profile-derived targets","State":"open","Body":"This change enables Worker SDK projects to participate in the Publish SDK, which include Publish Profiles. There are two parts to this change:\r\n\r\n* The first part is simple - the Worker SDK Imports the props and targets from the Publish SDK, in a way similar to what the Web SDK does to enable the same behavior.\r\n* The second is more complex - even with the Publish SDK included, container publishing doesn't work because of a gap in the target dependency order. \r\n\r\nThe primary target dependency chain here is \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<_DotNetCLIPostPublishDependsOn>\r\n      _InitProjectCapabilityProperties;\r\n      _AspNetCoreProjectSystemPostPublish;\r\n      AfterPublish;\r\n</_DotNetCLIPostPublishDependsOn>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf most interest is the `_AspNetCoreProjectSystemPostPublish` target, which has a DependsOn chain of:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<_AspNetCoreProjectSystemPostPublishDependsOn>\r\n      _InitPublishIntermediateOutputPath;\r\n      $(_DotNetPublishTransformFiles);\r\n      _PublishFiles;\r\n</_AspNetCoreProjectSystemPostPublishDependsOn>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `_PublishFiles` target is the one that PublishProfiles hook into. The problem is that `_AspNetCoreProjectSystemPostPublish` has a condition such that it only fires for ASP.NET projects. We need a way for non-ASP.NET projects to invoke similar targets.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we've added a new target to the `_DotNetCLIPostPublishDependsOn` dependency chain: `_OtherNetProjectPostPublish`. This target has the following dependency chain:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<_OtherNetProjectPostPublishDependsOn>\r\n      _InitPublishIntermediateOutputPath;\r\n      _PublishFiles;\r\n</_OtherNetProjectPostPublishDependsOn>\r\n```\r\nThe two targets added are the non-ASP.NET-specific publish targets. This new target is also conditioned (for now!) to only allow Worker SDK projects to use it. This limits the blast radius of this change so that Console apps don't accidentally get included.\r\n\r\nWe definitely can _and should_ push these changes down to Console apps now that we cracked this nut.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Need to add tests showing Worker template projects can build containers","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35794","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Allow Worker SDK projects to invoke Publish Profile-derived targets\" (#35794)"},{"Id":"1919162731","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-29T17:28:19","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"35790","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/windowsdesktop","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:Coherency Updates)\r\n## Coherency Updates\r\n\r\nThe following updates ensure that dependencies with a *CoherentParentDependency*\r\nattribute were produced in a build used as input to the parent dependency's build.\r\nSee [Dependency Description Format](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/DependencyDescriptionFormat.md#dependency-description-overview)\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Coherency Updates**:\r\n  -

When used to publish an executable, you select a RuntimeIdentifier and it all works: the dependency scan selects the runtime package, copies the DLL to the correct bin directory alongside the test assembly, lists it in deps.json, and so on.\r\n\r\nHowever, when running in Visual Studio or bare \"dotnet test\", by default no RuntimeIdentifier is passed in, so none of the dependency machinery is invoked and the library from the nuget package is not placed in the build directory. So any attempt to call native code fails.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand how to work around this by editing project files, it's not exactly a user-friendly experience, especially once you really are supporting multiple runtimes.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nProject:\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\r\n\r\n    <IsPackable>false</IsPackable>\r\n    <IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ClangSharp\" Version=\"16.0.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk\" Version=\"17.6.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit\" Version=\"3.13.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit3TestAdapter\" Version=\"4.2.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit.Analyzers\" Version=\"3.6.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"coverlet.collector\" Version=\"6.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```\r\nusing ClangSharp.Interop;\r\n\r\nnamespace TestProject1\r\n{\r\n\tpublic class Tests\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t[Test]\r\n\t\tpublic void TestVersion()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tCXString version = clangsharp.getVersion();\r\n\t\t\tAssert.IsNotNull(version);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the test in Visual Studio or \"dotnet test\".\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe test should call the native function in libclangsharp.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n\"System.DllNotFoundException : Unable to load DLL 'libClangSharp' or one of its dependencies: The specified module could not be found.

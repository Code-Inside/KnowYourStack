issue \"`dotnet publish` fails when `IsPublishable` is `false` for `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`-based projects: `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`\" (#49997) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"# Summary\n\nAttempting to `dotnet publish` a solution containing a `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`-based project with `IsPublishable` set to `false` causes a `DirectoryNotFoundException` exception to be thrown during the `TransformWebConfig` `MSBuild` task, halting the operation.\n\n# Repro steps\n\n1. Create a new .NET API project\n2. Add the `IsPublishable` property to the `.csproj`, set to `false`\n3. Run `dotnet publish`\n4. Observe the exception\n\n# Context\n\nWe have a large solution (~180 projects) that we are in the process of migrating from a raw, manual deployment process, to a more modern approach based on `dotnet publish`.\n\nBecause this is a migration effort, we want to do it incrementally, moving one \"leaf\" project at a time to the new system.\n\nTo make the migration incremental, we added `<IsPublishable>False</IsPublishable>` to the main `Directory.Build.props`, and then `<IsPublishable>True</IsPublishable>` on just the projects that are being migrated (currently, 3 out of the ~180 total projects). The idea is that we can run `dotnet publish` on the entire solution, and still control which projects will have their contents published.\n\nRight after making that configuration, I noticed one of our API projects that uses the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` SDK, started to throw an exception when `dotnet publish` was executed on the solution, _even though `IsPublishable` was set to `False` for it_ (it is one of the projects that have not yet been migrated).\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\JulianoLealGoncalves\\source\\repos\\WebAppPublishTest>dotnet publish\nRestore complete (0.6s)\n  WebAppPublishTest failed with 1 error(s) (0.0s)\n    C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.301\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Publish\\targets\\TransformTargets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Publish.TransformFiles.targets(50,5): error MSB4018:\n      The \"TransformWebConfig\" task failed unexpectedly.\n      System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Users\\JulianoLealGoncalves\\source\\repo\n      s\\WebAppPublishTest\\WebAppPublishTest\\bin\\Release\\net8.0\\publish\\web.config'.\n         at Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeFileHandle.CreateFile(String fullPath, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Fil\n      eShare share, FileOptions options)\n         at Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeFileHandle.Open(String fullPath, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare\n       share, FileOptions options, Int64 preallocationSize, Nullable`1 unixCreateMode)\n         at System.IO.Strategies.OSFileStreamStrategy..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare sha\n      re, FileOptions options, Int64 preallocationSize, Nullable`1 unixCreateMode)\n         at System.IO.Strategies.FileStreamHelpers.ChooseStrategyCore(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Fil\n      eShare share, FileOptions options, Int64 preallocationSize, Nullable`1 unixCreateMode)\n         at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode)\n         at Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Publish.Tasks.TransformWebConfig.Execute()\n         at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskExecutionHost.Execute()\n         at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskBuilder.ExecuteInstantiatedTask(TaskExecutionHost taskExecutionHost, TaskLogging\n      Context taskLoggingContext, TaskHost taskHost, ItemBucket bucket, TaskExecutionMode howToExecuteTask)\n\nBuild failed with 1 error(s) in 0.9s\n```\n\nThe exception comes from the `TransformWebConfig` `MSBuild` task, which inspects the target `publish` folder for the `web.config` file to transform. For some reason, this task is running even if publish is explicitly disabled, and then it crashes since the publish folder was not created at all. I'm not familiar with the whole publish targets, but this feels incorrect: if a project is set to not be published, it should not attempt to execute any `web.config` transformations on it since that is part of the publish procedure.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this is specific to the `.Web` SDK. Testing with the `.Worker` SDK doesn't reproduce the problem.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nAdding the following property to the project resolves the issue (but of course feels like a hack):\n```xml\n<IsWebConfigTransformDisabled>True</IsWebConfigTransformDisabled>\n```\n\n# Related\n\n- https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates/issues/818\n- https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/13365\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3766"},{"Id":"52731235527","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-07-30T12:24:38","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49996","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[main] Update dependencies from nuget/nuget.client\" (#49996) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:fcb199f6-ff33-44a0-f3ef-08d8e97c775d)\n## From https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client\n- **Subscription**: [fcb199f6-ff33-44a0-f3ef-08d8e97c775d](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=fcb199f6-ff33-44a0-f3ef-08d8e97c775d)\n- **Build**: [7.0.0.88](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=12060956)\n- **Date Produced**: July 29, 2025 6:18:06 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [4d25915cdeb377a6ae6173ae418d9181893e653d](https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client/commit/4d25915cdeb377a6ae6173ae418d9181893e653d)\n- **Branch**: dev\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - From [7.0.0-preview.1.67 to 7.0.0-preview.1.88][1]\n    - Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver\n    - NuGet.Build.Tasks\n    - NuGet.Build.Tasks.Console\n    - NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack\n    - NuGet.CommandLine.XPlat\n    - NuGet.Commands\n    - NuGet.Common\n    - NuGet.Configuration\n    - NuGet.Credentials\n    - NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core\n    - NuGet.Frameworks\n    - NuGet.LibraryModel\n    - NuGet.Localization\n    - NuGet.Packaging\n    - NuGet.ProjectModel\n    - NuGet.Protocol\n    - NuGet.Versioning\n\n[1]: https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client/compare/3326797718...4d25915cde\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:fcb199f6-ff33-44a0-f3ef-08d8e97c775d)\n\n"},{"Id":"52730947256","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-07-30T12:18:38","Actor":"colejohnson66","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49995","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"`PublishAot=true` and `IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true` should produce a warning\" (#49995) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Using `PublishSingleFile=true` and `IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true` produces a single file when using non-AOT publishing.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

[worked-in:2019?]\nIn the past, you used to be able to just Ctrl+., generate a method and type away. Now you end up with a lambda throwing a NotImplementedException. This means that I need to press a sequence of ~12 keys / key combinations, before I can type the body of the method. I only need to leave implementation for later in about one in a hundred cases, which means a huge waste of time accumulates quickly and results in a loss of focus every time I generate a new method. Instead of typing up a quick method body and going back to where I was, by the time I delete the exception I forget what the method was intended to do...

TargetFrameworks both being set","State":"open","Body":"### Issue\nIf you use `Directory.Build.props` it can happen, that you set a default `<TargetFramework>` element and then try to setup one of the projects as a multi-targeting project with `<TargetFrameworks>` element.\n\nYou start to see unexpected warnings `NU1702` and `MSB3277` and wonder why MSBuild tries to resolve references with a target framwork that you didn't include in `<TargetFrameworks>`.\n\nEspecially if you then try to consume this library in an application project, you will get a **runtime exception** (\"Could not load...\") if not both resolved DLLs of a reference like `System.Text.Json` have by chance the same version number (which in case of STJ it is not!).\n\n### Sample\n#### Directory.Build.props\n```csproj\n<Project>\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net48</TargetFramework>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n#### Multi-Targeting Project\nClassLibrary1:\n```csproj\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <!-- <TargetFramework>net48</TargetFramework> implictly set by Directory.Build.props -->\n    <TargetFrameworks>net48;net9.0</TargetFrameworks>\n    <!-- Or better something like <TargetFrameworks>net8.0;net9.0</TargetFrameworks> to be even more confused by dependency resolution! -->\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Text.Json\" Version=\"9.0.7\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n```csharp\npublic class Class1\n{\n    public Class1()\n    {\n        // required to trigger runtime exception\n        JsonSerializer.Serialize(1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Application Project\nConsole1:\n```csproj\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\ClassLibrary1\\ClassLibrary1.csproj\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\nProgram.cs:\n```csharp\nvar foo = new Class1();\nJsonSerializer.Serialize(1);\n```\n\n### Workaround\nJust define an empty `<TargetFramework>` element in the multi-targeting project so it is not set and `<TargetFrameworks>` can kick in as expected.\n\n### Expectation\nShow a warning that a project uses both `<TargetFramework>` and `<TargetFrameworks>` to point developers to this invalid configuration.\n\n### Info\n<summary>\n<header>\nInfos\n</header>\n<details>\n.NET SDK:\n Version:

The idea is that we can run `dotnet publish` on the entire solution, and still control which projects will have their contents published.\n\nRight after making that configuration, I noticed one of our API projects that uses the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` SDK, started to throw an exception when `dotnet publish` was executed on the solution, _even though `IsPublishable` was set to `False` for it_ (it is one of the projects that have not yet been migrated).\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\JulianoLealGoncalves\\source\\repos\\WebAppPublishTest>dotnet publish\nRestore complete (0.6s)\n  WebAppPublishTest failed with 1 error(s) (0.0s)\n    C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.301\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Publish\\targets\\TransformTargets\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Publish.TransformFiles.targets(50,5): error MSB4018:\n      The \"TransformWebConfig\" task failed unexpectedly.\n      System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Users\\JulianoLealGoncalves\\source\\repo\n      s\\WebAppPublishTest\\WebAppPublishTest\\bin\\Release\\net8.0\\publish\\web.config'.\n         at Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeFileHandle.CreateFile(String fullPath, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Fil\n      eShare share, FileOptions options)\n         at Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeFileHandle.Open(String fullPath, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare\n       share, FileOptions options, Int64 preallocationSize, Nullable`1 unixCreateMode)\n         at System.IO.Strategies.OSFileStreamStrategy..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare sha\n      re, FileOptions options, Int64 preallocationSize, Nullable`1 unixCreateMode)\n         at System.IO.Strategies.FileStreamHelpers.ChooseStrategyCore(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Fil\n      eShare share, FileOptions options, Int64 preallocationSize, Nullable`1 unixCreateMode)\n         at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode)\n         at Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Publish.Tasks.TransformWebConfig.Execute()\n         at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskExecutionHost.Execute()\n         at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskBuilder.ExecuteInstantiatedTask(TaskExecutionHost taskExecutionHost, TaskLogging\n      Context taskLoggingContext, TaskHost taskHost, ItemBucket bucket, TaskExecutionMode howToExecuteTask)\n\nBuild failed with 1 error(s) in 0.9s\n```\n\nThe exception comes from the `TransformWebConfig` `MSBuild` task, which inspects the target `publish` folder for the `web.config` file to transform. For some reason, this task is running even if publish is explicitly disabled, and then it crashes since the publish folder was not created at all. I'm not familiar with the whole publish targets, but this feels incorrect: if a project is set to not be published, it should not attempt to execute any `web.config` transformations on it since that is part of the publish procedure.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this is specific to the `.Web` SDK. Testing with the `.Worker` SDK doesn't reproduce the problem.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nAdding the following property to the project resolves the issue (but of course feels like a hack):\n```xml\n<IsWebConfigTransformDisabled>True</IsWebConfigTransformDisabled>\n```\n\n# Related\n\n- https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates/issues/818\n- https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/13365\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3766","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49997","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`dotnet publish` fails when `IsPublishable` is `false` for `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`-based projects: `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`\" (#49997)"},{"Id":"3274430640","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-29T17:32:22","Actor":"TimPurdum","Number":"49988","RawContent":null,"Title":"TypeScript Compilation in Razor Class Library causes build to fail in referencing projects","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\nA Razor Class Library with TypeScript files does not consistently build successfully in .NET 9+\n\n### To Reproduce\n[Repro Project](https://github.com/dymaptic/TypeScriptBuildIssueDemo)\n\n1.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\n\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to a .NET vulnerable webapp or loading a specially crafted file into a vulnerable application.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/109740\n\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\n\nApplications that do not use the NrbfDecoder component are not affected by this vulnerability. By default, .NET console apps and web apps do not reference this component.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\n\n* Any .NET 9.0 application running on .NET 9.0.0.RC.2 or earlier.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected Packages\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected packages versions listed below\n\n### <a name=\".NET 9\"></a>.NET 9\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[System.Formats.Nrbf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Formats.Nrbf)               |  <9.0.0 | 9.0.0\n\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 . If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\nNote: You may need to take both actions. Upgrading to 9.0 GA is not by itself sufficient to resolve the vulnerability, since you could still be pulling in the vulnerable package by reference.\n\n* If you have .NET 8.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n\n\n Version:   8.0.200\n Commit:    8473146e7d\n\nRuntime Environment:\n\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\n\nHost (useful for support):\n\n  Version: 8.0.3\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\n\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\n\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\n\n  Microsoft.NetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\n\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0  Runtime or .NET 9.0.100 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

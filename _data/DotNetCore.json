See that issue for discussion.\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers are hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains are hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which will [soon cease operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We are required to [migrate to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. It is possible that `.azureedge.net` domains will have downtime.\n\n> Current status:\n> - `azureedge.net` CDN domains are functional\n> - New CDN domains are functional\n> - Updated install scripts that use new CDNs are available.\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Switch `azureedge.net` references to new domains\n> - Consider switching to temporary install script URLs\n> \n> Last update: 2024.12.23\n> Next Update: 2024.12.26\n\nYou may need to adapt to these changes.\n\nThere is a chance that `azureedge.net` domains will cease being functional with downtime. We will do our best to avoid that. Moving your usage to the new CDN is the best path to avoiding that.\n\nOur plan is a work-in-progress and is expected to evolve.\n\n## Affected resources\n\nDomains affected:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n- https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nURLs affected:\n\n- https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh\n- https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/ (various)\n\nNot affected:\n\n- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/\n- https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/\n\n\nThere are many users of these resources, for example:\n\n- https://github.com/search?q=dotnetcli.azureedge.net&type=code\n- https://github.com/search?q=dot.net%2Fv1%2Fdotnet-install&type=code\n\nEarlier today, we switched the two `azureedge.net` domains above to use [Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview). We intended this change to be transparent to all users. These domains are currently sending 100% of traffic to our [edg.io](https://edg.io/) CDNs. In the near term, we intend to start sending some or all traffic to a different CDN, which may break users with convervative firewall rules.\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/install-scripts/6cbf2c9ff4615b468f39dfbd2e536e2f6fbe2f95/src/dotnet-install.ps1\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/install-scripts/6cbf2c9ff4615b468f39dfbd2e536e2f6fbe2f95/src/dotnet-install.sh\n\nNote: These scripts are for temporary usage and are unsigned (important for PowerShell users). We will update the install script at the official location at a later time.\n\nThe updated scripts prefer the new CDNs, while enabling fallback to the legacy `azureedge.net` domains. The legacy domains may be removed at a later point.\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\nNotes (for the install script):\n\n- The `-NoCdn` or `--no-cdn` argument can be used to bypass using the CDN, which may help some users.\n- The `-AzureFeed` or `--azure-feed` argument can be used to specify an alternate storage account or CDN.\n\n## Plan for domains\n\nThere are multiple domains, used for different purposes.\n\n### Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNote: Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\n### CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://ci.dot.net.\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Remaining changes\n\nThe following changes are planned:\n\n- Update azureedge.net domains traffic manager configuration to use one or more new CDNs\n- Publish official install scripts (at `https://dot.net/v1/` location).\n- Update `aka.ms/dotnet` short links to forward to new CDNs.\n\nThe following resources use URLs that will be updated to the new domains.\n\n- [dotnet/dotnet-docker](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/6125) Dockerfiles\n- [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9669) JSON files\n- [dotnet/templating](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/pull/8595) template data\n- [iis.net](https://www.iis.net/) is affected\n\n## Risks\n\nThere is a chance that the edgio CDN services will be terminated we, our partners, and our users have a chance to adapt to the proposed changes in a staged and safe manner. If that happens, we will change existing scripts and links to use the new URLs and CDN immediately. That approach would maintain service for the bulk of users but might break users with firewall rules.\n\nWe recommend that users adapt to these changes as quickly as possible.\n\nAzure DevOps and GitHub Actions installation tools are dependent on some of these resources. We are working directly with those teams to maintain continuity of service. They are moving to the new domains at best speed."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Standard":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreFx":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"45522251394","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T21:44:53","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76735","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix issue parsing regex category\" (#76735) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76731"},{"Id":"45522246874","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T21:44:52","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76731","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Incorrect RegEx parsing in c#\" (#76731) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Incorrect-RegEx-parsing-in-c/10819593)._\n\n---\n[severity:It's more difficult to complete my work]\nWhen I use a negative character class that specifies a named class containing a \"-\", the C# compiler incorrectly flags it as having incorrectly ordered characters. \n\nThe expression in which the error occurred was like this: \n\n```\nRegex.Replace( \"...\", @\"[^\\p{IsBasicLatin}\\p{IsLatin-1Supplement}\\p{IsLatinExtended-A}\\p{IsLatinExtended-B}\\p{IsLatinExtendedAdditional}]+\", \"\")\n```\nTwo errors messages were generated by Intellisense (but not by the compiler).

This is because it's misusing the library version here:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/a4e5d121bf4d32de6c8c79432b2d3283b68f7a67/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/DependencyContextBuilder.cs#L536\n\n### To Reproduce\nTry the repro: [deps-assemblyversion-projectreference.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17320086/deps-assemblyversion-projectreference.zip)\n\nIt prints all the assembly version info from the deps, you'll see:\n```\nFile(AssemblyVersion)\ntest.dll()\nMicrosoft.Extensions.DependencyModel.dll(8.0.0.2)\nwb.dll(0.0.0-this-is-a-package-version-not-an-assembly-version)\nSystem.Private.CoreLib.dll(9.0.0.0)\nMicrosoft.VisualBasic.dll(10.0.0.0)\nMicrosoft.Win32.Primitives.dll(9.0.0.0)\nmscorlib.dll(4.0.0.0)\nnetstandard.dll(2.1.0.0)\nSystem.AppContext.dll(9.0.0.0)\n...\n```\n\nNote the `0.0.0-this-is-a-package-version-not-an-assembly-version`  that's a problem.\n\nThis is particularly a problem for the WPF repo which is trying to test and needs to replace the windowsbase.dll from dotnet/runtime with their real copy, but could be a problem for anyone trying to use ProjectReferences to replace framework assemblies (common for folks testing the frameworks).\n\nThe fix is to read the assembly version just as is done for other files (and the file version) or pull it from the reference metadata (EG: FusionName msbuild metadata)."},{"Id":"45518509775","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T19:33:46","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45934","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[automated] Merge branch 'release/8.0.3xx' => 'release/8.0.4xx'\" (#45934) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"I detected changes in the release/8.0.3xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/8.0.4xx.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

Please describe.\nThe [package validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/apicompat/diagnostic-ids#how-to-suppress) of the .NET SDK allows me to selectively accept/ignore a breaking changes using ` CompatibilitySuppressions.xml` files.\n\nUnfortunately, for a human being, this file is very hard to parse and almost impossible to write.\nThis has the following problems during daily development of libraries:\n\n1. When faced with a PR that contains new entries in ` CompatibilitySuppressions.xml` it is very hard to understand what the breaking change actually is. The way we currently often examine these suppression in a code review is, we checkout the PR branch locally, temporarily remove the new suppression entries and then pack the projects in question, so we can see a human readable error message. so instead of the somewhat incomprehensible suppression\n   ```xml\n     <Suppression>\n       <DiagnosticId>CP0008</DiagnosticId>\n       <Target>T:Foo.Bar.MyClass</Target>\n       <Left>lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</Left>\n       <Right>lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</Right>\n       <IsBaselineSuppression>true</IsBaselineSuppression>\n    </Suppression>\n   ```  \n   the reviewer now has the proper error message again:\n   `error CP0008: Type 'Foo.Bar.MyClass' does not implement interface 'Foo.Bar.IMyInterface' on lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll but it does on [Baseline] lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll`\n2. There is no good way for the PR author to document in the source code, _why_ this particular breaking change is acceptable here. \n    Adding an XML comment into the suppression file would be overwritten when the suppression file is regenerated the next time a new breaking change is accepted.\n\n   ```xml\n     <Suppression>\n       <!--  This is OK here, because .... -->\n       <DiagnosticId>CP0008</DiagnosticId>\n       <Target>T:Foo.Bar.MyClass</Target>\n       <Left>lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</Left>\n       <Right>lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</Right>\n       <IsBaselineSuppression>true</IsBaselineSuppression>\n    </Suppression>\n   ```  \n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n1. Also include the actual error message right in the supression entry. This would solve problem 1. Something similar like the example below\n   ```xml\n     <Suppression>\n       <DiagnosticId>CP0008</DiagnosticId>\n       <DiagnosticMessage>Type 'Foo.Bar.MyClass' does not implement interface 'Foo.Bar.IMyInterface' on lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll but it does on [Baseline] lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</DiagnosticMessage>\n       <Target>T:Foo.Bar.MyClass</Target>\n       <Left>lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</Left>\n       <Right>lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</Right>\n       <IsBaselineSuppression>true</IsBaselineSuppression>\n    </Suppression>\n   ```  \n2. When regenerating the ` CompatibilitySuppressions.xml` file, leave all existing modifications to that file unchanged as long as it does not change the sematics of the supressions. This could solve problem 1 and 2 because we can now add helpful comments to the suppressions, like this:\n   ```xml\n     <Suppression>\n       <!--  Type 'Foo.Bar.MyClass' does not implement interface 'Foo.Bar.IMyInterface' on lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll but it does on [Baseline] lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll -->\n       <!--  This is OK here, because .... -->\n       <DiagnosticId>CP0008</DiagnosticId>\n       <Target>T:Foo.Bar.MyClass</Target>\n       <Left>lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</Left>\n       <Right>lib/net8.0/MyAssembly.dll</Right>\n       <IsBaselineSuppression>true</IsBaselineSuppression>\n    </Suppression>\n   ```  \n   ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/45928","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API Compat] Problematic developer experience of compatibility suppressions\" (#45928)"},{"Id":"2784439882","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T15:58:31","Actor":"Evangelink","Number":"45927","RawContent":null,"Title":"`dotnet test` Microsoft.Testing.Platform experience","State":"open","Body":"## Summary\n\nIntroduce a new `dotnet test` experience that is focused toward the new testing platform `Microsoft.Testing.Platform` (aka MTP).\n\nThis ticket will act as the hub of all implementations related to the new `dotnet test` experience.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nWe have introduced a new testing platform as an alternative to `VSTest`, this new testing platform, named `Microsoft.Testing.Platform` changes fundamentally the way the test applications are structured.\n\n`VSTest`:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1fb5ad9-4b43-4eed-91d4-f6df16594d67)\n\n`Microsoft.Testing.Platform`:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/358f2fac-34ec-434b-8b26-1c19b7572ee6)\n\nCurrently, `Microsoft.Testing.Platform` allows tests to be run through `dotnet test` using some workaround by injecting a named target that will be loaded by `dotnet test` code in place of the one from `VSTest`. This behavior is fine when doing basic `dotnet test` call but is showing problem when we want to use more advanced features as the options are statically declared and tuned for VSTest. For example, we need to do `dotnet test -- --minimum-expected-tests 10` or `dotnet test -p:TestingPlatformCommandLineArguments=\"--minimum-expected-tests 10\"`. This is also causing confusions to users for some arguments, for example, doing `dotnet test --filter A` will not forward the filter down to the new platform but will eat the argument for VSTest (which is not plugged in that context) and users should instead do `dotnet test -- --filter A` or `dotnet test -p:TestingPlatformCommandLineArguments=\"--filter A\"`.\n\nOne downside to the new testing platform is that each test application is working in \"isolation\" to other test applications while some features are expected to be provided as cross-test apps (e.g. users would expect at least one merge trx report and not only 1 trx per test application).\n\n## Proposed Feature\n\nInstead of shipping an extra client executable, we will use `dotnet` process to act as a client and offer pre and post run capabilities.\n\nThe new testing platform offers the possibility to extend the supported command line arguments so we no longer can simply rely on a static way but instead either ask test applications for their supported options (e.g. when user will do `dotnet test --help`) or forward the extra parameters down to the test applications (e.g. `dotnet test --coverage`, the `--coverage` needs to be forward to each test application).\n\nWe should allow users to select the `dotnet test` mode (see #45471) to be either the new experience or the old one.\n\n## Under discussions\n\n- We are currently discussing what to do for the case of \"mixed mode\", at least one project using VSTest and one project using MTP.\n\n## Limitations\n\n## Other\n\nNote that I will edit this main design as we progress through the design and implementation and incorporate user's comments.\n\nPinging main test framework authors:\n- MSTest: @Evangelink @Youssef1313 \n- NUnit: @OsirisTerje @rprouse\n- TUnit: @thomhurst \n- xUnit: @bradwilson","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/45927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`dotnet test` Microsoft.Testing.Platform experience\" (#45927)"},{"Id":"2784329158","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-13T15:24:45","Actor":"MaceWindu","Number":"45926","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issues with AppHost generation with ArtifactsPath set","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\n\nWe need to generate RID-specific `apphost.exe` files for our project, which we do using following post-build step in project file (see full example in attachment)\n\n```xml\n<Target Name=\"BuildAppHosts\" AfterTargets=\"Build\" Condition=\" '$(RID)' == '' \">\n    <ItemGroup>\n      <TFM Include=\"$(TargetFrameworks)\" Condition=\" '$(TargetFramework)' == '' \" Label=\"Build from VS\" />\n      <TFM Include=\"$(TargetFramework)\" Condition=\" '$(TargetFramework)' != '' \" Label=\"Build from MSBUILD or dotnet\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n\n    <MSBuild Projects=\"$(MSBuildProjectFullPath)\" Properties=\"RID=win-x86;Configuration=$(Configuration)\" Targets=\"Build\" />\n    <Copy SourceFiles=\"<path to build results>\\$(AssemblyName).exe\" DestinationFiles=\"<path to main bin>\\$(AssemblyName).win-x86.exe\" />\n\n    <MSBuild Projects=\"$(MSBuildProjectFullPath)\" Properties=\"RID=win-x64;Configuration=$(Configuration)\" Targets=\"Build\" />\n    <Copy SourceFiles=\"<path to build results>\\$(AssemblyName).exe\" DestinationFiles=\"<path to main bin>\\$(AssemblyName).win-x64.exe\" />\n  </Target>\n```\n\nThis works fine in default setup, but breaks when artifacts folder used.\n\nFirst issue:\nNow build with RID doesn't replace `apphost.exe` with one for current RID if file already exists. This could be workarounded by adding `Delete` file step, but then second issue arises.\n\nSecond issue:\nIf we delete apphost.exe on machine without SDK for target framework installed, it is not restored. E.g. we have `net9.0` SDK and want to build for both `net8.0` and `net9.0` - it will fail with error like this:\n\n```\n##[error]C:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.101\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5322,5): Error MSB3030: Could not copy the file \"D:\\a\\1\\s\\.build\\obj\\LinqToDB.CLI\\Azure\\net6.0\\apphost.exe\" because it was not found.\n```\n\nReason for that is failed condition evaluation for `_CreateAppHost` target because `AppHostSourcePath` property is empty:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/v9.0.100/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets#L831\n\nThis property is empty, because it is initialized with `ResolvedAppHostPack.Path` property\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/v9.0.100/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.FrameworkReferenceResolution.targets#L337\n\nWhich is empty if SDK is not installed (`runtime`-only install doesn't help)\n\nThere is `PathInPackage` property instead, which is not used by code above\n```\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5598788Z                    Task \"GetPackageDirectory\" (TaskId:5097)\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5599161Z                      Task Parameter:\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5599500Z                          PackageFolders=\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5599841Z                              C:\\Users\\VssAdministrator\\.nuget\\packages\\\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5600267Z                              C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Shared\\NuGetPackages (TaskId:5097)\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5600672Z                      Task Parameter:\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5601014Z                          Items=\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5601318Z                              AppHost\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5601668Z                                      NuGetPackageId=Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.win-x64\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5602096Z                                      NuGetPackageVersion=6.0.36\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5602552Z                                      PathInPackage=runtimes\\win-x64\\native\\apphost.exe\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5602895Z                                      RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64 (TaskId:5097)\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5603234Z                      Output Item(s): \n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5603561Z                          ResolvedAppHostPack=\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5603815Z                              AppHost\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5604199Z                                      NuGetPackageId=Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.win-x64\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5604630Z                                      NuGetPackageVersion=6.0.36\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5605074Z                                      OriginalItemSpec=AppHost\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5605676Z                                      PackageDirectory=C:\\Users\\VssAdministrator\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.netcore.app.host.win-x64\\6.0.36\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5606147Z                                      PathInPackage=runtimes\\win-x64\\native\\apphost.exe\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5606549Z                                      RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64 (TaskId:5097)\n2025-01-13T11:01:12.5606959Z                    Done executing task \"GetPackageDirectory\".

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - All domains and installer/scripts are functional\n> - No domains are using Edgio CDN\n> - `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.*`  redirects to new domain\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using Akamai and Azure Front Door CDNs.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.10\n> Next update: 2025.01.15\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains are hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which will [soon cease operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We are required to [migrate to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease to function around 3/31.\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for signed builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Sdk/LTS/latest.version\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/LTS/latest.version\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n- `https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/tree/main/src`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

It may have been deleted from the keychain.`  The `dotnet dev-certs https` command relies on `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` and fails with this error.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects .NET 6, .NET 8, and .NET 9. The issue is addressed in the upcoming .NET 6.0.34, .NET 8.0.10, and 9.0.0-rc2 releases, scheduled for release in October 2024.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nmacOS 15 uses a different status code to indicate a key is not in a Keychain than prior versions do.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have not already upgraded to macOS 15 from a prior version and use .NET, you are not impacted by this issue.  If you are planning to upgrade to macOS 15, the workaround is to upgrade to .NET 6.0.34. .NET 8.0.10, or .NET 9.0.0-rc2 (scheduled for October 2024) prior to upgrading to macOS 15.\r\n\r\nLoading a certificate and its associated private key from a PKCS#12/PFX are not affected.  If you are using an application that supports loading a certificate (and associated private key) by either PFX or PEM, converting your PEM contents to PFX - and updating configuration appropriately - may unblock you.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/324","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Certificate Issues on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\")\" (#324)"},{"Id":"2517880984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T21:26:30","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"323","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 RC 1","State":"open","Body":"# Announcement\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Release Candidate 1.\r\n\r\nThis release contains the following improvements:\r\n\r\n## **📚Libraries**\r\n\r\n* [WebSocket `Keep-Alive` Ping and Timeout APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#websocket-keep-alive-ping-and-timeout)\r\n* [Add ZLib, Brotli compression options](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-zlib-and-brotli-compression-options)\r\n* [Add TarEntry.DataOffset](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-tarentrydataoffset)\r\n* [`HttpClientFactory` no longer logs header values by default](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#httpclientfactory-no-longer-logs-header-values-by-default)\r\n* [Out-of-proc Meter wildcard listening](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#Out-of-proc-Meter-wildcard-listening)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md)\r\n\r\n## **🛠️ SDK**\r\n\r\n* [Workload History](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md#workload-history)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md)\r\n\r\n## **🌐 ASP.NET Core**\r\n\r\n* [Improvements to SignalR distributed tracing](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#improvements-to-signalr-distributed-tracing)\r\n* [Keep-alive timeout for WebSockets](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keep-alive-timeout-for-websockets)\r\n* [Keyed DI in middleware](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keyed-di-in-middleware)\r\n* [Override `InputNumber` type attribute](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#override-inputnumber-type-attribute)\r\n* [Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-linux)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md)\r\n\r\n## **📱 .NET MAUI**\r\n\r\n* [Added `HorizontalTextAlignment.Justify`](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md#added-horizontaltextalignmentjustify)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md)\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\nTo get started with .NET 9, [install the .NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).\r\n\r\nIf you're on Windows using Visual Studio, we recommend installing the latest [Visual Studio 2022 preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/). .NET 9 is now can be installed directly through the Visual Studio installer starting with Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Visual Studio Code and the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension with .NET 9.\r\n\r\nYou can find [.NET 9 RC 1 Installer & Binaries](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/9.0.0-rc.1.md) on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Team Announcements & Discussions\r\n\r\nDiscuss this release with the product teams on GitHub through the announcements for this release.\r\n\r\n* [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/discussions/24698)\r\n* ASP.NET Core(https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/discussions/57787)\r\n\r\n## Stay up-to-date with .NET 9\r\n\r\nYou can stay up-to-date with all the features of .NET 9 with:\r\n\r\n* [What's new in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview)\r\n* [What's new in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0)\r\n* [What's new in .NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/whats-new/dotnet-9)\r\n* [What's new in EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew)\r\n* [Breaking Changes in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/9.0)\r\n* [.NET 9 Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/README.md)\r\n\r\nFor .NET 9 previews we are utilizing GitHub Discussions to make announcements.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nWe [announced Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/) in the first half of 2019 and [shipped the first stable](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-1-0/ba-p/825859) package later that year. That release [coincided with .NET Core 3.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/#introducing-the-new-sqlclient). We’ve been developing [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) in the [dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient) repo since that time, over the last five years. It’s now time to start the deprecation process for the [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) package. We plan to take a staged process to deprecation, with the intent to align support changes and associated code transition activities between these libraries to natural migration points between .NET major versions.\r\n\r\nAll System.Data.SqlClient users are encouraged to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. We offer improvements and significantly higher support via the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nWe intend to deprecate the System.Data.SqlClient package in stages.\r\n- **Before .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - Publish a new 5.0.0 package, including the following changes.\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 7 and earlier and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and earlier.\r\n  - Publish assets for the following target frameworks: .NET 8, .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n  - Add [Obsolete attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#obsolete-attribute) to .NET 8 and .NET Standard 2.0 assets. This will generate new warnings for .NET 8+ and .NET Standard users.\r\n  - Continue to offer security servicing, for .NET 8, and .NET Framework 4.6.2+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - No change\r\n  - We will not support this package for .NET 9+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 8 EOL:**\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 8 users (the .NET 8 library will be removed).\r\n  - Maintain support for .NET Framework 4.6.2+ users.\r\n  - Security servicing will be provided via .NET Framework, not the package, at that point.\r\n  - We do not expect to update the package again after this point.\r\n  - We will not mark the package as deprecated since it will only support .NET Framework users with an implementation provided by .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nWe will remove support in the package for unsupported .NET and .NET Framework versions at various stages of this deprecation plan. Users affected by those changes are encouraged to move to a supported .NET or .NET Framework version and to adopt the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove support for .NET 6 since it will go EOL shortly after this new package is released, even though .NET 6 will still be supported at the time. Publishing a .NET 8 library significantly simplifies the plan, both in terms of what we will deliver and what we need to explain.\r\n\r\nFor .NET dates, see [.NET Releases.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) .NET 9 will [GA in November](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) of this year. .NET 8 will go EOL in November, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe current package version of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) is 4.8.6, at the time of writing. These changes will be made with a 5.0.0 version and later.\r\n\r\n**Note:** _This deprecation doesn’t apply to the System.Data.SqlClient namespace in .NET Framework._\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n\r\nDaily downloads of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient on nuget.org are nearing 50% higher than System.Data.SqlClient. We expect the gap in usage between the two libraries will continue to increase. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is the best library we offer to access SQL Server.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing high-quality, performance-driven, and secure data access technologies. We strongly encourage users to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. It is actively maintained and supports the latest SQL Server features.\r\n\r\n### How to migrate? \r\n\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project, then update your references and using statements. Our [porting cheat sheet](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/blob/master/porting-cheat-sheet.md) provides a step-by-step set of changes you may need to make.\r\n\r\n1. **Update your project references:** Replace references to System.Data.SqlClient with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n2. **Modify your using statements:** Update your using statements in your code files from System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n3. **Test your application:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected after the migration.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to [support semi-automatic migration](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/issues/1593) via [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant).\r\n\r\n**Support & Feedback:** If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please reach out through our [official support channels](https://support.microsoft.com/) or join the discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues).\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions - dotnet/SqlClient Wiki - GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\n- [Introduction to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16)\r\n- [SQL Server and ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql)\r\n- [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcement: System.Data.SqlClient package is now deprecated\" (#322)"},{"Id":"2464032272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T19:08:47","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"321","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 Preview 7","State":"open","Body":"We are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Preview 7.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs [announced earlier](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293), starting with .NET 9, we no longer include an implementation of `BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (.NET Framework remains unchanged). The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type. Hence, setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient to use `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n* We published the [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide]. We'd appreciate if could give it a read and give us feedback by filling issues in the [dotnet/docs] repo.\r\n* If you experience issues related to BinaryFormatter's removal not addressed in this migration guide, please file an issue in the [dotnet/runtime][dotnet/runtime] repo and indicate that the issue is related to the removal of `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Why was it removed?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][security-guide]*\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that BinaryFormatter is unsafe. Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is a common weakness enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue: [CWE-502 \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"][CWE502]. `BinaryFormatter` is such a deserializer. We also cover this in the [BinaryFormatter security guide][security-guide].\r\n\r\n### What are my options to move forward?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][migration-guide]*\r\n\r\nYou have two options to address the removal of `BinaryFormatter`'s implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Migrate away from BinaryFormatter**. We strongly recommend you to investigate options to stop using `BinaryFormatter` due to the associated security risks. The [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide] lists several options.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep using BinaryFormatter**. If you need to continue using `BinaryFormatter` in .NET 9, you need to depend on the unsupported [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters][compat-pack] NuGet package, which restores the unsafe legacy functionality and replaces the throwing implementation.\r\n\r\n[compat-pack]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package\r\n[migration-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/\r\n[security-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide\r\n[CWE502]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\r\n[dotnet/docs]: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-general-issue.yml\r\n[dotnet/runtime]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/new\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106240.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's different?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!"},{"Id":"49679107858","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:27","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/358","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET 10 Preview 4\" (#358) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

The user gets an error that the package (the name of which has been normalized) is not supported.\n\nThis led to an issue with the Azure Functions Core Tools, which uses `dotnet new` behind the scenes. That issue is here for reference: https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/issues/4399\n\nThe exact same gestures work fine with SDK 9.0.102.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. On MacOS using Apple Silicon, install .NET SDK 9.0.200 or later.\n2. Create a path that includes an`@` character:\n  a. `mkdir repro@4`\n3. Put a copy of any templating package into that folder:\n  a. `dotnet new console`\n  b. `dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.ProjectTemplates -v 4.0.5086 --package-directory ./repro@4`\n4. Install that package with `dotnet new install` using the absolute path to it:\n  a. `dotnet new install ./repro@4/microsoft.azure.functions.worker.projecttemplates/4.0.5086/microsoft.azure.functions.worker.projecttemplates.4.0.5086.nupkg`\n\nThe Azure Functions Core Tools issue referenced above provides an alternative set of repro steps, in context. That issue is unfortunately compounded by that tool swallowing the error from `dotnet new install`, but the notes there may be helpful as well.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```cli\ndotnet new --install \"/usr/local/Cellar/azure-functions-core-tools@4/4.0.7030/templates/net-isolated/projectTemplates.4.0.5051.nupkg\" -v diag\n[2025-05-01 16:21:19.535] [Debug] [Template Engine] => [Execute]: Execute started\nWarning: use of 'dotnet new --install' is deprecated.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/cli) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Is there any such package that we could use @MiYanni?\r\n\r\nIf no \"package based\" solution exists, maybe we could add some kind of test fixture, build task, etc. which downloads the SDKs that we need for such tests and stashes them in some appropriate location?\r\n\r\nIdeally, we could even allow testing against an old SDK version in different tests in the same project, so that we can verify what happens when `dotnet run-api` is not available in the user's SDK.\r\n\r\nThere might be analogous problems for MSBuildHost (testing how we handle behaviors of one or another specific MSBuild version).

I expect the same interpretation for values passed to `GlobalOptions` as the compiler does. \n\nFor example, the following definition builds the project for `net9.0` and `netstandard2.1`, instead of throwing an exception that no target framework is defined.\n```xml\n<TargetFrameworks>\n    net9.0;\n    netstandard2.1;\n</TargetFramework>\n```\n\nAs such, I expect the following line in `global-options.cs`:\n\n```csharp\n// build_property.immutableeditableobjectadapterfeatures = WINUI_DATAGRID;UNO\n```\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n\n```csharp\n// build_property.immutableeditableobjectadapterfeatures = \n```\n\n## Multivalues\n\nChange client project: \n\n```diff\n---   <ImmutableEditableObjectAdapterFeatures>\n---      WINUI_DATAGRID;\n---      UNO;\n---    </ImmutableEditableObjectAdapterFeatures>\n+++    <ImmutableEditableObjectAdapterFeatures>WINUI_DATAGRID;UNO;</ImmutableEditableObjectAdapterFeatures>\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n\nI expect the following line in `global-options.cs`:\n\n```csharp\n// build_property.immutableeditableobjectadapterfeatures = WINUI_DATAGRID;UNO\n```\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n\n```csharp\n// build_property.immutableeditableobjectadapterfeatures = WINUI_DATAGRID\n```\n\nThis is invalid for any plausible interpretation of the result:\n1. The value of the property `ImmutableEditableObjectAdapterFeatures` is `WINUI_DATAGRID;UNO;` not `WINUI_DATAGRID`.\n2. The last defined value of `ImmutableEditableObjectAdapterFeatures` is `UNO`, not `WINUI_DATAGRID`.

produce invalid DW_AT_decl_file/DW_AT_decl_line","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\nWhen building NativeAOT shared library (.so/.dylib) produced DWARF symbols contain invalid entries for DW_AT_decl_file/DW_AT_decl_line - which has following impact:\n\n- difficult to set breakpoints via native debugger, ex. lldb breakpoint set FileName.cs:LineNumber does not work\n\nEven though function symbol names are properly generated (DW_at_name) - the file/line number is not.\n\nThis bug exists on all linux-bionic/ios target types (i.e. linux-bionic-arm64, ios-arm64) \n\n### To Reproduce\n1. Create a empty project targeting net9.0\n2. Reference nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/Portable.BouncyCastle\n3. Create few classes in project, make sure they are not trimmed away. \n4. Build nativeaot shared library (as: https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/core/nativeaot/NativeLibrary),\n5. In output directory, do: dwarfdump --debug-info bin/Debug/net9.0/linux-bionic-arm64/libName.so.dbg >> dwarf_symbols.txt\n6. Verify that all DW_AT_decl_line/file for all methods that existed in nativeaot C# project are invalid (in my case all points to something like: \"DW_AT_DECLFILE: (“//crypto/src/x509/SubjectPublicKeyInfoFactory.cs))\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\nn/a\n\n### Further technical details\ndotnet --info:\n\n.NET SDK:\n- version: 9.0.101\n- Commit: eedb237549\n- Workload version: 9.0.101.2\n- MSBuild version: 17.12.12+1cce77968","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49052","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[NativeAOT] DWARF symbols for shared libraries produce invalid DW_AT_decl_file/DW_AT_decl_line\" (#49052)"},{"Id":"3074491470","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-19T17:01:50","Actor":"akoeplinger","Number":"49060","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reenable tests in WorkloadTests.cs","State":"open","Body":"Those were disabled as part of https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45500 but looks like they can be reenabled: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/45516#issuecomment-2691831312","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49060","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Reenable tests in WorkloadTests.cs\" (#49060)"},{"Id":"3074403628","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-19T16:26:59","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"49058","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0.2xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/scenario-tests","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:abb37a54-9eb1-4e8c-9c83-31c39dbe86c9)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests\n- **Subscription**: [abb37a54-9eb1-4e8c-9c83-31c39dbe86c9](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=abb37a54-9eb1-4e8c-9c83-31c39dbe86c9)\n- **Build**: [20250519.1](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2712695)\n- **Date Produced**: May 19, 2025 4:14:38 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [5c769be3733c4ffa543fc7e7ec5fadd4fa8f8c9e](https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests/commit/5c769be3733c4ffa543fc7e7ec5fadd4fa8f8c9e)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/9.0\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - **Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.scenario-tests**: [from 9.0.0-preview.25264.1 to 9.0.0-preview.25269.1][1]\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.ScenarioTests.SdkTemplateTests**: [from 9.0.0-preview.25264.1 to 9.0.0-preview.25269.1][1]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests/compare/45b878678c...5c769be373\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:abb37a54-9eb1-4e8c-9c83-31c39dbe86c9)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49058","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/9.0.2xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/scenario-tests\" (#49058)"},{"Id":"3074403582","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-19T16:26:58","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"49057","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/scenario-tests","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2c00c595-7965-4766-ead0-08dcbc303060)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests\n- **Subscription**: [2c00c595-7965-4766-ead0-08dcbc303060](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=2c00c595-7965-4766-ead0-08dcbc303060)\n- **Build**: [20250519.1](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2712695)\n- **Date Produced**: May 19, 2025 4:14:38 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [5c769be3733c4ffa543fc7e7ec5fadd4fa8f8c9e](https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests/commit/5c769be3733c4ffa543fc7e7ec5fadd4fa8f8c9e)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/9.0\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - **Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.scenario-tests**: [from 9.0.0-preview.25266.2 to 9.0.0-preview.25269.1][1]\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.ScenarioTests.SdkTemplateTests**: [from 9.0.0-preview.25266.2 to 9.0.0-preview.25269.1][1]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests/compare/a11e0d6f22...5c769be373\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:2c00c595-7965-4766-ead0-08dcbc303060)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49057","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/9.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/scenario-tests\" (#49057)"},{"Id":"3074265428","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-19T15:33:36","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"49056","RawContent":null,"Title":"[StaticWebAssets] Explicitly use invariant culture during parsing","State":"open","Body":"* Use invariant culture when parsing metadata.\r\n* Recompute metadata from file if for some reason parsing fails.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49056","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[StaticWebAssets] Explicitly use invariant culture during parsing\" (#49056)"},{"Id":"3074242650","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-19T15:26:57","Actor":"mariam-abdulla","Number":"49055","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add tests for test templates","State":"open","Body":"This pull request introduces a new test project, `Microsoft.TestTemplates.Acceptance.Tests`, to validate template installation and functionality in the .NET SDK.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

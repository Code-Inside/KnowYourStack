It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

However, it would aid JIT with handling such methods if the generated throw helper was annotated with `[DoesNotReturn]`. Currently, it appears to be inlined, which subsequently reduces the likelihood of inlining methods with non-exhaustive switch expressions with missing default clause. \n\nI understand that this is ideally an issue for JIT to handle, but given the current policy of applying `[DoesNotReturn]` to other throw helpers too, this falls in line with the established practice.\n\nThe motivation for this issue is that we are using https://www.nuget.org/packages/StaticCS to great success in performance-sensitive scenarios, which results in switches that are effectively exhaustive for which Roslyn cannot legally elide the default clause (not until we get type unions 🙂).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/81412","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Suggestion] Emit `[DoesNotReturn]` on generated `ThrowSwitchExpressionException` for switch expressions Roslyn does not consider exhaustive\" (#81412)"},{"Id":"3654248676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-22T08:37:34","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"81411","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve 'else' indentation in a couple more cases","State":"open","Body":"Followup to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81393.

In this model, generators can emit type declarations (signatures) in phase one, and full implementations in phase two. This enables generators to reference types produced by other generators, solving cross-generator dependency issues that currently require complex workarounds.\n\n## Motivation\n\nModern .NET applications commonly use multiple source generators that need to reference types created by other generators. The current limitation where generators cannot see each other's outputs creates significant problems for framework and library authors.\n\n### Real-World Problem: .NET MAUI\n\nA typical .NET MAUI application uses multiple generators:\n- **XAML compiler** - generates code-behind \n- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm** - generates observable properties and commands\n- **MAUI Community Toolkit** - generates behaviors and converters  \n- **Blazor** - generates component code\n\nWhen XAML code-behind needs to reference an MVVM-generated property, compilation fails because the XAML generator runs without visibility into the MVVM generator's output:\n\n```csharp\n// CommunityToolkit.Mvvm generates this property\npublic partial class MainViewModel : ObservableObject\n{\n    [ObservableProperty]\n    private string _title;\n    // Generates: public string Title { get; set; }\n}\n\n// XAML generator tries to reference it - FAILS\npublic partial class MainPage : ContentPage\n{\n    public MainPage()\n    {\n        BindingContext = new MainViewModel();\n        BindingContext.Title = \"Hello\";  // ERROR: Title doesn't exist yet\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Current Workarounds\n\n1. **Nested Generator Execution** - Invoke one generator from within another\n   - Only works for generators you control\n   - Violates independence principles\n   - Creates tight coupling\n\n2. **Heuristic Type Guessing** - Assume type shapes and allow errors\n   - Poor developer experience\n   - Cryptic error messages  \n   - Breaks on version changes\n\n3. **MSBuild Ordering** - Use Before/After properties\n   - Requires knowing all generators\n   - Breaks with transitive dependencies\n   - Forces full recompilation\n   - No circular dependency resolution\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nIntroduce a two-phase compilation model where generators declare types in phase one and implement them in phase two.\n\n### API Design\n\n```csharp\npublic void Initialize(IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext context)\n{\n    // Phase 1: Declare types and signatures\n    // These are visible to other generators in Phase 2\n    context.RegisterDeclarationOutput(\n        source: ...,\n        action: (context, source) => \n        {\n            // Emit partial types, method signatures, property declarations\n            // No implementation bodies\n        });\n    \n    // Phase 2: Provide implementations\n    // Can see all declarations from Phase 1\n    context.RegisterImplementationSourceOutput(\n        source: ...,\n        action: (context, source) => \n        {\n            // Emit method bodies, complete implementations\n            // Has access to enriched compilation including all declarations\n        });\n}\n```\n\n### Execution Model\n\n**Phase 1: Declaration Phase**\n1. Create initial `Compilation` from user code\n2. Execute all `RegisterDeclarationOutput` actions across all generators\n3. Collect generated declaration sources (partial types, signatures)\n4. Create `EnrichedCompilation` = initial compilation + declaration sources\n5. Provide `EnrichedCompilation` to Phase 2\n\n**Phase 2: Implementation Phase**\n1. Use `EnrichedCompilation` that includes all generator declarations\n2. Execute all `RegisterImplementationSourceOutput` and `RegisterSourceOutput` actions\n3. Each generator can now see types declared by other generators\n4. Produce final compilation output\n\n### Concrete Example\n\n**Phase 1 - CommunityToolkit.Mvvm declares property:**\n```csharp\ncontext.RegisterDeclarationOutput(source, (ctx, data) => {\n    ctx.AddSource(\"MainViewModel.g.cs\", @\"\n    public partial class MainViewModel : ObservableObject\n    {\n        public string Title { get; set; } // Declaration only\n    }\");\n});\n```\n\n**Phase 2 - MAUI XAML generator sees and uses it:**\n```csharp\ncontext.RegisterImplementationSourceOutput(source, (ctx, data) => {\n    // Semantic model now includes Title property from Phase 1\n    var viewModel = compilation.GetTypeByMetadataName(\"MainViewModel\");\n    var titleProp = viewModel.GetMembers(\"Title\").FirstOrDefault();\n    \n    ctx.AddSource(\"MainPage.g.cs\", @\"\n    public partial class MainPage : ContentPage\n    {\n        public MainPage()\n        {\n            BindingContext = new MainViewModel();\n            BindingContext.Title = \"\"Hello\"\"; // ✓ Compiles successfully\n        }\n    }\");\n});\n```\n\n**Phase 2 - CommunityToolkit.Mvvm implements property:**\n```csharp\ncontext.RegisterImplementationSourceOutput(source, (ctx, data) => {\n    ctx.AddSource(\"MainViewModel.g.cs\", @\"\n    public partial class MainViewModel : ObservableObject\n    {\n        private string _title;\n        public string Title \n        { \n            get => _title;\n            set => SetProperty(ref _title, value); // Implementation\n        }\n    }\");\n});\n```\n\n## Design Principles\n\n**Determinism**: Phase 1 cannot access other generators' declarations, preventing circular dependencies and non-deterministic behavior.\n\n**Performance**: Only declaration changes trigger Phase 2 invalidation. Implementation-only changes don't cascade to dependent generators.\n\n**Compatibility**: Existing single-phase generators continue to work. The two-phase model is opt-in via new registration methods.\n\n**Scalability**: Generators don't need to know about each other. The runtime manages visibility automatically.\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **No explicit ordering required** - Eliminates MSBuild Before/After complexity\n2. **Better incremental compilation** - Implementation changes don't cascade unnecessarily  \n3. **Improved developer experience** - Fewer cryptic compilation errors\n4. **Framework interoperability** - Enables rich ecosystem of composable generators\n5. **Backward compatible** - Existing generators continue to work unchanged\n6. **Prevents circular dependencies** - Phase 1 isolation ensures deterministic compilation\n\n## Comparison with Existing APIs\n\n| API | Phase | Visibility | Current Behavior |\n|-----|-------|------------|------------------|\n| `RegisterPostInitializationOutput` | Pre-compilation | N/A | Global usings, attributes |\n| `RegisterDeclarationOutput` (new) | Phase 1 | Initial compilation only | Type signatures, partial declarations |\n| `RegisterImplementationSourceOutput` (enhanced) | Phase 2 | Declarations from all generators | Complete implementations |\n| `RegisterSourceOutput` | Phase 2 | Declarations from all generators | Both declaration and implementation |\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **Naming**: `RegisterDeclarationOutput` vs `RegisterSignatureOutput`?\n2. **Granularity**: Should declaration vs implementation be per-generator or per-output?\n3. **Diagnostics**: How should errors in Phase 1 affect Phase 2 execution?\n4. **Incremental behavior**: What level of caching between phases?\n5. **Strictness**: Should the limitation to produce just declarations in Phase 1 be enforced or recommended?\n6. **Existing RegisterSourceOutput**: Should it continue to work in Phase 2, or be deprecated in favor of explicit declaration/implementation split?\n\n## Prior Art\n\n- [Roslyn Issue #57589](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/57589) - Earlier two-phase proposal discussion (October 2020)\n- Current `RegisterImplementationSourceOutput` - Already distinguishes implementation from other outputs\n- [Source Generators Cookbook](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/source-generators.cookbook.md)\n- [Incremental Generators](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/incremental-generators.md)\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\nThis proposal would require:\n1. Extensions to `IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext` API\n2. New compilation pipeline stages in the generator driver\n3. Updates to incremental compilation caching strategy to track declaration vs implementation changes\n4. Generator testing infrastructure updates to support two-phase execution\n5. Documentation and migration guidance for generator authors\n6. Performance analysis to ensure phase separation doesn't introduce overhead\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- Cross-generator dependencies in .NET MAUI\n- Razor/Blazor component generation challenges  \n- Third-party generator ecosystem limitations\n\n---\n\n**Authors**: .NET MAUI Team  \n**Date**: November 2025  \n**Status**: Proposal\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/81395","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Two-Phase Incremental Generators for Cross-Generator Dependencies\" (#81395)"},{"Id":"3650738430","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T08:37:36","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"81392","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge 'main' into features/collection-expression-arguments","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81392","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge 'main' into features/collection-expression-arguments\" (#81392)"},{"Id":"3650433696","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T07:01:13","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"81391","RawContent":null,"Title":"Namespace Rename Feature Does Not Allow Dots","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Namespace-Rename-Feature-Does-Not-Allow-/11003244)._\n\n---\n[severity:It's more difficult to complete my work]\nWhen renaming a namespace in Visual Studio, if we enter a dot in the new name it says the new name is invalid and does not allow the rename. Supposedly at one time, copy/pasting the dot could be used as a workaround, but that appears to no longer work in VS 2022.\n\nThis has been a problem going back many VS versions (at least to 2017, possibly much earlier) and it doesn't really make sense given that Microsoft's own recommendation is to use a dot-based syntax for namespaces (e.g. Company.Product.Project or whatever). And, we try to always rename with Visual Studio's built-in rename functionality as opposed to trying to rename all references manually. But it makes it very difficult to do so with this limitation.\n\nIt seems quite strange that this has flown under the radar for so long as I imagine renaming a namespace is quite a common procedure and many, if not most companies will use the MS recommendation for naming convention which includes dots. Yet somehow this still has not been fixed. Also, it seems like this should be a trivial fix ?\n\nCould we please look into getting a fix implemented for this?\n\nThanks!\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 11/20/2025, 07:00 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

This was happening because when we resolve the template folders, we decided to order the folders. However, the order of the folders was determined by the string key, which is just the string value of the folder name. When sorting strings, they'll be alphabetical, so `\"10\"` comes before `\"9\"` because 1 is less than 9. To fix, I simply sort them by the (already parsed) SemanticVersion value of the folder name. Thus, 9 would come before 10.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nFor local testing, it would build `10.0.0` as the template folder name. I copied a template folder from an installed SDK 9, `9.0.11`, and dropped it in there beside the 10 folder. The local template directory path is `artifacts\\bin\\redist\\Debug\\dotnet\\templates`. I copied a 9 version out of the installed path of `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\templates`.\r\n\r\nFor `dotnet new sln`, the 10 version creates a `.slnx` file. For the 9 version, a `.sln` file. So, testing was just adding and removing the 9 folder and observing the unintentional change in behavior. When the 9 folder is added, only a `.sln` would be created. After making the change to the order within `GetBestVersionsByMajorMinor`, I observed that when adding/removing the 9 folder, the 10 templates were now always being loaded. Meaning, a `.slnx` was always created, which is the intended behavior.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I fought a bit with Copilot to create a couple of unit tests. It originally created tests that would not actually test this issue. Meaning, I could revert my change and the test would still pass. 😟 I got it to revise it a couple times and it ended up making okay-enough tests that just check that 9/10 barrier. I made the method internal so the unit tests could directly run it. The test project has InternalsVisibleTo access to the CLI project.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/51861","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix template resolution ordering bug\" (#51861)"},{"Id":"3653361877","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-21T23:16:38","Actor":"AaronRobinsonMSFT","Number":"51860","RawContent":null,"Title":"Provide stable mechanism for discovering `nethost`","State":"open","Body":"### Is your feature request related to a problem?

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

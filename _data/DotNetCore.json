This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/**TBD**\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET 6.0 application running on .NET 6.0.24 or earlier.\r\n* Any .NET 7.0 application running on .NET 7.0.13 or earlier.\r\n* Any .NET 8.0 application running on .NET 8.0.0.\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.1  Runtime  or .NET 8.0.101 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.15 or SDK 7.0.115 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.26 or SDK 6.0.321 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update.

Vulnerabilities in .NET and similar products are scored with this advice in mind. The score for your implementation this product may not be as severe, however we recommend installing the update as soon as possible in an abundance of caution.\r\n\r\nAt the time this vulnerability report was published, the assessed CVSS score was 9.1. The full list of metrics can be found at https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-0057 (Opens in new window or tab).\r\n\r\nIn our assessment of this vulnerability, while .NET-based applications are not by default subject to this attack, we recognize that some applications may reasonably make authentication decisions based on the return values of the impacted API. We consider the ease of exploit and likely consequences to applications written in this manner.\r\n\r\nWe will at a future date share more detailed information about how we assess vulnerabilities against a reasonable worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This PR makes two basic changes to the code:\r\n\r\n1) Change the lists inside NodeOperations to pooled SegmentedLists. These arrays can get quite large (the file I'm testing makes several of these exceed 1000 elements). The lifetime of NodeOperations is fairly contained, so making it follow the disposable pattern to free the lists back to the pool was straight forward.\r\n\r\n2)  Change FormattingContext.AddSuppressOperations to not allocate an apparently unnecessary segmented array.

Upon trying to upgrade from .NET 6 to .NET 8, we can no longer run any `dotnet` command from Wine (for example, `/opt/wine-stable/bin/wine64 $HOME/win-dotnet/dotnet.exe --version`) on our pipelines. Instead we get an exception:\r\n```\r\nUnhandled exception. System.IO.IOException: Invalid access.\r\n   at System.ConsolePal.SetConsoleOutputEncoding(Encoding enc)\r\n   at System.Console.set_OutputEncoding(Encoding value)\r\n   at Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Program.Main(String[] args)\r\n```\r\nI'm using `dotnet --version` as an example in this bug, but it happens for `dotnet *anything*`.\r\n\r\n* Running `/path/to/wine64 /path/to/dotnet.exe --version` from the Azure agent pipeline job **works on .NET 5/6**\r\n* Running `/path/to/wine64 /path/to/dotnet.exe --version` **in a regular Terminal on the same agent** works on .NET 5/6/7/8\r\n* Native Linux .NET 8 commands work from the pipeline, if `dotnet-sdk` is installed\r\n\r\nIn Wine, we get the following warning when running from an Azure agent:\r\n`0024:warn:console:console_ioctl Incorrect access to Shell-no-window console (ioctl=50403c)`\r\n\r\nWhich possibly was not a problem until hitting this code that was added: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/commit/697d62c7fdec87ff1b2c81a47e02b1294dab9e7b\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nWe ❤ code! Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a GitHub repo, Gist snippet, or other means to see the isolated behavior.\r\n\r\nWe may close this issue if:\r\n- the repro project you share with us is complex. We can't investigate custom projects, so don't point us to such, please.\r\n- if we will not be able to repro the behavior you're reporting\r\n-->\r\nPrereq: an Azure agent that runs on Linux\r\n\r\n1. Install the latest version of `wine-stable` on the agent\r\n1. Download and unzip the latest version of .NET 7 or .NET 8 **for Windows** somewhere on the agent, for example `$HOME/win-dotnet`\r\n1. In a pipeline script targeting the agent, run `/opt/wine-stable/wine64 $HOME/win-dotnet/dotnet.exe --version`\r\n1.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Upon trying to upgrade from .NET 6 to .NET 8, we can no longer run any `dotnet` command from Wine (for example, `/opt/wine-stable/bin/wine64 $HOME/win-dotnet/dotnet.exe --version`) on our pipelines. Instead we get an exception:\r\n```\r\nUnhandled exception.

Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a GitHub repo, Gist snippet, or other means to see the isolated behavior.\r\n\r\nWe may close this issue if:\r\n- the repro project you share with us is complex. We can't investigate custom projects, so don't point us to such, please.\r\n- if we will not be able to repro the behavior you're reporting\r\n-->\r\nPrereq: an Azure agent that runs on Linux\r\n\r\n1. Install the latest version of `wine-stable` on the agent\r\n1. Download and unzip the latest version of .NET 7 or .NET 8 **for Windows** somewhere on the agent, for example `$HOME/win-dotnet`\r\n1. In a pipeline script targeting the agent, run `/opt/wine-stable/bin/wine64 $HOME/win-dotnet/dotnet.exe --version`\r\n1.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider where an attackercan perform an AiTM (adversary-in-the-middle) attack between the SQL client and the SQL server. This may allow the attacker to steal authentication credentials intended for the database server, even if the connection is established over an encrypted channel like TLS.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf you are not using the System.Data.SqlClient or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package libraries within your application, you are not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\n[System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/) | <4.8.6 | 4.8.6\r\n[Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/) | <2.1.7, < 3.1.5, <4.0.5, <5.1.3 | 2.1.7, 3.1.5, 4.0.5, >=5.1.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the  [affected packages](#affected-packages) listed above are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or, .NET 8.0 you must update the nuget package to an updated version as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n* If you are using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, anywhere (any version of .NET Framework or .NET) and you are using a version that is vulnerable you must update as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\nIf you are using the System.Data.SqlClient package from a .NET Framework (any version) application, you must install the January 2024 .NET Framework updates made available via Windows Update or Microsoft Update. You should also consider updating the System.Data.SqlClient package as keeping dependencies up to date is good general hygiene, but updating this package is neither necessary nor sufficient to fix the issue in a .NET Framework-based application.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the difference between Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient please read the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient initial announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/)  for an explanation,\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization. The main repos are located at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime and https://github.com/dotnet/aspnet/. The Announcements repo (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue.

An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96700\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner. Other project types, such as web applications, are not impacted by this vulnerability unless they explicitly invoke the X.509 chain building APIs themselves in a vulnerable manner or they consume an external package which does this on their behalf.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET 6.0 application running on .NET 6.0.24 or earlier.\r\n* Any .NET 7.0 application running on .NET 7.0.13 or earlier.\r\n* Any .NET 8.0 application running on .NET 8.0.0.\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0 RC2 Runtime  or .NET 8.0 RC2 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.13 or SDK 7.0.113 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.24 or SDK 6.0.319 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0 and and .NET 7.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`.

It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone.

Apps that use the classic confinement run without any sandboxing, and may not be allowed in the public snap store for the purpose of working around this issue\r\n  - See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1634#issuecomment-667332468 for more information\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested a small app under Snap's strict confinement\r\n- PAL, coreclr, and libraries tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- Instead of the creating thread changing the affinity of the created thread, the created thread changes its own affinity after starting, the difference is mostly invisible\r\n- Where appropriate, used a fallback to use the pthread implementation for setting the affinity when sched_setaffinity is not available, so in the theoretical possibility of a different pthread implementation for setting the affinity, there would be no change from before","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28071","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Change new thread's affinity after thread starts, from the same thread, as a workaround for Snap\" (#28071)"},{"Id":"668934448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-30T17:04:31","Actor":"silvioguiso","Number":"28069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Decodes bitstream to string","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Decodes bitstream to string\" (#28069)"},{"Id":"665279560","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-28T18:29:19","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Number":"28066","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hardcode path to ICU on macOS","State":"closed","Body":"Port of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/05f17e3170d014efe63202c4e7e7b641e8f8fef6.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28066","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Hardcode path to ICU on macOS\" (#28066)"},{"Id":"665280682","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-24T17:09:08","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Number":"28067","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hardcode path to ICU on macOS","State":"closed","Body":"Port of dotnet/runtime@05f17e3","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28067","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Hardcode path to ICU on macOS\" (#28067)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CLI-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"699651571","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-12T01:06:48","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"13552","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1.4xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c55a2056-fc07-4dda-df7f-08d83e1bc58b)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: c55a2056-fc07-4dda-df7f-08d83e1bc58b\r\n- **Build**: 20200911.13\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/12/2020 12:10 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 84709ee587032c833b11f0d4796c0c66e3038876\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

There is no workaround and if running long enough, .NET will consume all available memory and crash. The `SecTrustRef` is internal structure and holds additional objects - like URL of OCSP or CRL responder so leaked memory is bigger than small. \r\n\r\n## Customer  Impact \r\nWe have worked with a major customer who has been hitting this leak in an app that they intend to widely deploy within their organization (10K”s of deployments). They are encountering this leak and it is blocking their deployment. They have attempted to work around it by restarting the app when their memory consumption reaches a threshold but this workaround is not sustainable for them at scale so they are seeking a fix backported to 3.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nno.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nthe fix was verified with Apple's development tools e.g. `leaks` utility\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nlow.

I've added a new project to provide an implementation for the mappings, but maybe that would be better outside of CoreRT, in another GitHub repo, and just some instructions added to the docs?

And then use libunwind to make use of this data. It's the same way LLVM based compilers do it. \r\n\r\nBut while stepping through the actual unwind function (stepWithDwarf) in the past  could not avoid to notice that this whole process is very inefficient. First it needs to decode and parse the dwarf FDE. After this it loops over all possible registers to check if they are even used and if the code needs to figure out what type of register it is and how it needs to be handled. This loop might not that bad on X86 and X64 with only 8 and 32 possible registers. But for ARM64 there are already 95 and it got even worse with ARM that uses 287.\r\n\r\nThis all might not be a big issue for C++ and similar languages were exceptions are literal exceptions or not used at. But with C# and .Net we have a GC that needs to walk the stack quite regular.\r\n\r\nIf I understand it correct the regular VM for .Net Core/.Net 5 has a custom stack walk that is more in line with what MSVC does:\r\nARM: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/arm64-exception-handling?view=vs-2019\r\nAMD64: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/exception-handling-x64?view=vs-2019\r\nARM64: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/arm64-exception-handling?view=vs-2019 \r\n\r\nThis looks way more efficient. \r\n\r\nTherefore I like to ask if there is a reason to not use a custom stack walk solution in CoreRT, too?\r\nI must confess that I haven't profiled how bad it is in reality. But as GC pause are one of the bigger issues with game development in C# I get a little bit uneasy when seeing all these loops in the stepping code.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8305","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Question: Is there a special reason for using libunwind on systems with an elf based file format?\" (#8305)"},{"Id":"693563232","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T05:24:10","Actor":"yowl","Number":"8299","RawContent":null,"Title":"Question: NoMetadataRuntimeInterfacesAlgorithm","State":"closed","Body":"What would be an example of a type that fits this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Gets interface information from the RuntimeTypeHandle for a type with no metadata\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    internal class NoMetadataRuntimeInterfacesAlgorithm : RuntimeInterfacesAlgorithm\r\n    {\r\n```\r\n?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8299","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Question: NoMetadataRuntimeInterfacesAlgorithm\" (#8299)"},{"Id":"695468498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-08T01:04:55","Actor":"yowl","Number":"8303","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wasm: Provide implementation for InternalCall in external project","State":"open","Body":"To get interoperability with mono WebAssembly, some methods that are `InternalCall` are needed , such as https://github.com/mono/WebAssembly.JSInterop/blob/9e65a41cf1043ce29c7d722bd3885648a653e734/src/WebAssembly.JSInterop/InternalCalls.cs#L14-L15. \r\n\r\nI'm currently working around this with something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n            if (callee.IsInternalCall)\r\n            {\r\n                if (callee.Name == \"InvokeJS\")\r\n                {\r\n                    var coreRtJsInternalCallsType = _compilation.TypeSystemContext\r\n                        .GetModuleForSimpleName(\"CoreRT.WebAssembly.Interop\")\r\n                        .GetKnownType(\"CoreRT.WebAssembly.Interop\", \"InternalCalls\");\r\n                    callee = coreRtJsInternalCallsType.GetMethod(\"InvokeJS\", null);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\nin `ILToWebAssemblyImporter.cs`, `ImportCall`  but can I do this in a separate dll without substituting the method in Ilc?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8303","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Wasm: Provide implementation for InternalCall in external project\" (#8303)"},{"Id":"694236217","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-06T03:23:42","Actor":"Thealexbarney","Number":"8302","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enumerable.OrderBy does not work in reflection-free mode.","State":"open","Body":"Given this example code, the numbers should be printed in ascending order.\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\n\r\nnamespace test\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            int[] unsorted = { 5, 257, 66, 6 };\r\n\r\n            foreach (int val in unsorted.OrderBy(x => x))\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(val);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nA default CoreRT build will print the sorted numbers.\r\n```\r\n5\r\n6\r\n66\r\n257\r\n```\r\nHowever, the following is printed in reflection-free mode.\r\n```\r\n5\r\n257\r\n66\r\n6\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8302","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enumerable.OrderBy does not work in reflection-free mode.\" (#8302)"},{"Id":"693741074","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-05T00:36:34","Actor":"yowl","Number":"8301","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wasm: slightly more efficient LLVM int packing","State":"closed","Body":"This PR improves the size of the bitcode generated.\r\n\r\nFor int packing it was using a null pointer expression \r\n```\r\ni32* bitcast (i8* getelementptr (i8, i8* null, i32 5395538) to i32*)\r\n```\r\nThis is now\r\n```\r\ni32* inttoptr (i32 5395538 to i32*)\r\n````\r\nFor the HelloWasm bitcode this reduces it from 54,617,136 to 53,100,752.

The first sequence point for this method is at offset 36, so when its processing offset 1, there is no debug location set yet.  This is problem for llvm as if the function has a debug location, and this one does (it gets set on offset 36), then any call that could be in-lined must have a debug location and this is a problem for the call to initialise  the EH info enumerator.\r\n\r\nOne fix for this particular instance, and at least some of the others that are occurring, could be to not do the null check on the instance ldfld as this is an instance method, so unless this is a reflection call, then the instance should have been checked for null before calling the method.  \r\n\r\nAnother option to fix this problem in general could be to just take the first sequence point and apply that to call to `InitFromEhInfo`.

Unfortunately we've hit a bit of a roadblock - the NuGet restore times have shot up from ~1:30m -> ~16:00m (an increase of 10x!)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't share the full solution as it is sensitive. However I have been able to create a representative solution outside of the office. This representative solution has the same number of projects, the same ProjectReferences and the same third-party PackageReferences. With this representative solution, here are my results:\r\n\r\n- .NET Framework restore time: 14s average\r\n- .NET Core restore time: 51s average\r\n\r\nNote that the only thing that has changed between .NET Framework and .NET Core is moving from `net471` -> `netcoreapp3.1`.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\r\n\r\nExploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Core. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core checks the source markup of a file.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application running on .NET Core 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.0, you should download and install Runtime 3.0.2 or SDK 3.0.102 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.1 or SDK 3.1.101 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 3.0 and 3.1 installed, you need to install the updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

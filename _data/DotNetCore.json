issue \"\"dotnet package update\" modifies wrong project file (csproj)\" (#51012) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"### Describe the bug\n\nWith the CLI version `10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107`, running `dotnet package update` on one project intending to update PackageReferences in that project will instead add PackageReferences to a different project file that the first project references.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n[Repository that reproduces the issue](https://github.com/Joe-K-Sewell/bug-repros/tree/main/dotnet-package-update).\n\n1. Create the following:\n    * A solution (`dotnet new sln`)\n    * Class Library project Example.Core (`dotnet new classlib`)\n    * xUnit project Example.Test (`dotnet new xunit`)\n2. Reference the class library project from the xUnit test project.\n    * From the Example.Test directory: `dotnet reference add ..\\Example.Core\\Example.Core.csproj --project .\\Example.Tests.csproj`\n3. Add the projects to the solution.\n    * From the solution directory: `dotnet sln add .\\Example.Core\\Example.Core.csproj .\\Example.Tests\\Example.Tests.csproj`\n4. Update the package references in the test project to their latest versions:\n    * From the solution directory: `dotnet package update --project .\\Example.Tests\\Example.Tests.csproj`\n    * **OR** from the Example.Test directory: `dotnet package update`\n\n**Expected behavior**: changes are made to the `<PackageReference>` elements in `Example.Tests.csproj`.\n\n**Actual behavior**: new `<PackageReference>` elements are added to `Example.Core.csproj`. [Example commit showing this behavior](https://github.com/Joe-K-Sewell/bug-repros/commit/e8d2cea24bb996ce8602cee4e909dfbb689cb6f9).

This warning is irrelevant on modern .NET runtimes where strong-name validation has been removed, and was creating noise for users.\n\n## Changes\n\nModified `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.CSharp.targets` to append CS8002 to the `NoWarn` property when the project targets .NETCoreApp (modern .NET), using the `TargetFrameworkIdentifier` check for detection.\n\nThe suppression is applied automatically by the SDK and requires no action from users. Projects targeting .NET Framework and .NET Standard are unaffected and will continue to receive CS8002 warnings if applicable.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Before this change:**\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n    <!-- Users had to manually add CS8002 to suppress the warning -->\n    <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CS8002</NoWarn>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n**After this change:**\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n    <!-- CS8002 is now automatically suppressed for modern .NET -->\n  </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded comprehensive tests in `GivenThatWeWantToSuppressCS8002Warning.cs` that verify:\n- CS8002 is suppressed for net6.0, net7.0, and net8.0\n- CS8002 is NOT suppressed for net472, net48, netstandard2.0, and netstandard2.1\n- CS8002 suppression works correctly alongside existing NoWarn values\n\nAll tests pass successfully.\n\nFixes #43206\n\nRelated to dotnet/roslyn#76197\n\nFixes dotnet/sdk#51168\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>The SDK should suppress strong-name checking (CS8002) when targeting .NET TFMs</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Is your feature request related to a problem?

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

I am suggesting this because this is the only way we know it can work today, and, if something changed from under us to make one of the other type kinds \"start working\", it feels like manual intervention would still be needed. (i.e., we would need to determine whether it's possible for us to generate code with reasonable semantics, and decide whether to permit or continue blocking.) That is better than potentially being hit by the same \"generate bad IL\" issue as `IEnumerable<ReadOnlySpan<int>>`, but for some different type.\r\n\r\nIt would also be reasonable to block it for all type kinds, though, until we see a more compelling use case.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80593","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add a test for collection expression with ref

Create a file named `test.cs` with the following contents:\n   ```csharp\n   #!/usr/bin/dotnet\n   Console.WriteLine(\"hello\");\n   ```\n\n2. Run the following command:\n   ```\n   dotnet package add --file test.cs <Some.Package>\n   ```\n\n3. Observe that dotnet run, or that the resulting `test.cs` file has the `#:package ` line inserted before the shebang.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe package reference should be added after the shebang line, preserving the valid script structure and allowing the script to execute as intended.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe package reference is added before the shebang\n```\nerror CS1040: Preprocessor directives must appear as the first non-whitespace character on a line\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51171","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"dotnet package add --file inserts package reference before shebang in C# scripts\" (#51171)"},{"Id":"3496319805","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-08T17:39:15","Actor":"NikolaMilosavljevic","Number":"51170","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fail the RPM build if FPM tool is not present","State":"open","Body":"Currently, if the build is supposed to produce RPM packages, but the tooling (i.e. `fpm`) is missing, a message will be logged and the build will skip the RPM package generation.

This warning is irrelevant on modern .NET runtimes where strong-name validation has been removed, and was creating noise for users.\n\n## Changes\n\nModified `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.CSharp.targets` to append CS8002 to the `NoWarn` property when the project targets .NETCoreApp (modern .NET), using the `TargetFrameworkIdentifier` check for detection.\n\nThe suppression is applied automatically by the SDK and requires no action from users. Projects targeting .NET Framework and .NET Standard are unaffected and will continue to receive CS8002 warnings if applicable.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Before this change:**\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n    <!-- Users had to manually add CS8002 to suppress the warning -->\n    <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CS8002</NoWarn>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n**After this change:**\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n    <!-- CS8002 is now automatically suppressed for modern .NET -->\n  </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded comprehensive tests in `GivenThatWeWantToSuppressCS8002Warning.cs` that verify:\n- CS8002 is suppressed for net6.0, net7.0, and net8.0\n- CS8002 is NOT suppressed for net472, net48, netstandard2.0, and netstandard2.1\n- CS8002 suppression works correctly alongside existing NoWarn values\n\nAll tests pass successfully.\n\nFixes #43206\n\nRelated to dotnet/roslyn#76197\n\nFixes dotnet/sdk#51168\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>The SDK should suppress strong-name checking (CS8002) when targeting .NET TFMs</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Is your feature request related to a problem?

The agent runs `./build.sh /t:UpdateXlf` and commits the changes.\n\n### `/fixcompletions` Command  \nComment this on a PR to automatically update CLI completion snapshot tests when commands are modified. The agent builds, runs tests, updates snapshots, and commits the changes directly to the PR branch.\n\nBoth agents eliminate the need to clone the branch locally for these routine maintenance tasks. The instructions are comprehensive and include proper timeout guidance, error handling, and step-by-step workflows.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Atuomate Update XLF Task and Updating Completions Tests Tasks</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>We have 2 human based tasks in the .NET SDK repository which are very automatable. \n> \n> One task is to 'update xlf files' which is to update the translation files.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0  Runtime or .NET 9.0.100 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
